They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article 2 of Convention No. 87.\n58.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 35th Session (1952). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.\n4.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions\n59.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. 22/78 of 18 October 1978, repealed resolutions of 1973 which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section 356 of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article 4 of Convention no. 87, which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers\' and employers\' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.\n60.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section 350 of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.\n5.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises\n61.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. 13/74 of 21 October 1974, issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration\'s opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its 186th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.\n62.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.\n63.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores\' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on 31 October 1977 and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.\n64.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union (1 May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.\n65.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. 13/74 mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.\n6.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike\n66.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections 373, 374 and 377): for example, more than 60 per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section 636) and may order the resumption of work (section 640; see also sections 625 to 629 and 642). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section', 'Alvaro Taborda (8 January 1997). Death threats: Jairo Alfonso Gamboa Lpez; Aguirre Restrepo Oscar; Arango Alvaro Alberto; Barrio Castao Horacio; Cadavid Martha Cecilia; Franco Jorge Humberto; Giraldo Hctor de Jess; Gutirrez Jairo Humberto; Jaramillo Carlos Hugo; Jaramillo Galeano Jos Luis; Ramos Zapata Rangel; Restrepo Luis Norberto; Jorge Sliecer Marn Trujillo; Vctor Ramrez. Detained: Edgar Riao; Marcelino Buitrazo; Felipe Mendoza; Monarge Snchez; Guillermo Crdenas; Rafael Estupin; Hernn Vallejos; Luis Rodrigo Carreo; Leonardo Mosquera; Fabio Livano; Csar Carrillo. The Committee expresses its deep concern over these acts of violence and murders and condemns them. It asks the Government to keep it informed, as a matter of urgency, of the result of the investigations and judicial proceedings under way.(c) The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations on the numerous pending or presented allegations in 1998 in connection with the murders, disappearances, death threats and physical aggression involving trade union officials and members, as well as raids on union premises (see annexed the complete list of the allegations on which the Government has not communicated its observations), and urges it to communicate its observations on all the allegations without delay. Moreover, in the light of the prevalence of violence in Colombia against trade unionists, the Committee urges the Government to take immediate measures to provide protection for those trade union officials and members who have received death threats whose names are listed in the annex to this report.(d) The Committee urges the Government to keep it informed regarding the results of the appeal lodged by the Banco Andino against the administrative decision which imposed a fine for violation of convention standards, and regarding the inquiry it ordered into the alleged anti-union acts committed by the authorities of the Banco Andino and Citibank. Similarly, the Committee asks the Government to extend the scope of the inquiry to include the Sudameris and Anglo Colombiano banks, which are also mentioned by the complainants, and that if the allegations are substantiated, to punish those responsible for such acts and to prevent any recurrence in the future.(e) The Committee asks the Government to communicate without delay its observations on the allegations regarding acts of trade union persecution against officials and members of the Trade Union Association of Civil Servants of the Ministry of Defence, Armed Forces, National Police and related bodies (ASODEFENSA).(f) The Committee requests the Government to forward without delay its observations on the allegations submitted by the ICFTU, CLAT, CUT and CGTD in October 1998 concerning the murder, physical assaults, death threats and detention of trade unionists and trade union leaders arising out of the national strike of government workers. Furthermore, the Committee observes that Jorge Ortega Garca, Vice-President of the CUT, was among the trade union leaders murdered in October 1998, who the day he was murdered had signed a communication presenting new allegations relating to this case. The Committee deeply deplores the murder of Mr. Ortega Garca and observes that this is the second time that a trade union leader submitting a complaint of violations of trade union rights before the Committee on Freedom of Association is murdered.(g) The Committee reiterates its request to the Government to keep it informed on the results of the judicial process under way on the dismissal of trade union officials and members of the ALFAGRES S.A. and TEXTILIA Ltd. companies and of the Ministry of Finance.\n69.The Committee last examined Case No. 1787 at its March 1997 meeting (see 306th Report, paras. 248-294). The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) sent additional information in communications dated 3 February, 2 April, 5 May, 24 June, 16 and 23 July, 6 October and 6 November 1997 and 16 January 1998. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented new allegations relating to this case in a communication dated 23 January 1997. The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) sent additional information in a communication dated 6 August 1997.\n70.The Government sent partial observations in communications dated 29 May, 24 July and 16 December 1997 and 13 February 1998.\n71.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n82.First, before analysing the allegations and observations communicated by the Government, the Committee once again wishes to express its grave concern at the allegations which refer to a large number of murders, disappearances, as well as physical aggression, detentions and death threats against trade union officials, members and their families, as well as raids on trade union headquarters and trade union members\' homes. In this respect, the Committee notes with alarm that for practically the whole of 1997 the complainants have presented allegations of violent acts against trade union leaders and members. The Committee deplores that in spite of the seriousness of the situation the Government\'s replies have been limited to a very reduced number of allegations. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to remedy this situation.\n83.Likewise, the Committee notes that acts of violence have been committed against trade union members throughout the country and in all sectors of activity and a large number of these acts of violence have been committed against trade union officials and members of the agricultural sector -- members of FENSUAGRO or SINTRAINAGRO -- and the oil sector -- members of ECOPETROL or FEDEPETROL. The Committee deeply regrets that among the new allegations the murder of the Secretary-General of the Single Agricultural Trade Union Federation (FENSUAGRO), Vctor Garzn, in March 1997, appears. Vctor Garzn was interviewed and participated in the direct contacts mission which took place in the country in November 1996. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to stop all acts of violence against unionists and especially in those sectors where the trade unions mentioned operate.\n84.The Committee deplores that all factors seem to show that anti-union violence has not decreased and that those who commit these acts of violence against trade union officials or members continue in impunity, as the Government, since the last examination of this case in November 1996, has not provided information on one single case of detention, trial and judgement of those responsible for these acts.\n85.Taking into account the nature of the allegations and that it was mentioned in the report of the last direct contacts mission that the Public Defender in his 1996 report to Congress affirmed that ""there are still people in the armed forces and police who commit illegal and arbitrary acts in the course of their military and police activities"" and ""today thousands of Colombians are still terrorized by paramilitary groups"" (see 306th Report, p. 85 of the English version), the Committee, observing that the situation has not improved since that time, points out that it is the responsibility of the Government to guarantee the correct comportment of its security forces which, in any event and at all times, must respect human rights. The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for this principle.\n86.Thus, the Committee emphasizes that ""the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events"" and ""the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, 1996, paras. 51 and 55).\n87.In connection with the additional information presented on murders and disappearances of trade union officials and members, the Committee notes that the Government states that it has begun legal investigations into the following cases: (1) Nstor Eduardo Galndez Rodrguez (murdered on 4 March 1997); (2) Erieleth Barn Daza (murdered on 3 May 1997); (3) Jhon Fredy Arboleda Aguirre, William Alonso Surez Gil and Eladio de Jess Chaverra Rodrguez (murdered between 11 February and 7 March 1997); (4) Luis Carlos Muoz (murdered on 7 March 1997); (5) Nazareno de Jess Rivera Garca (murdered on 12 March 1997); (6) Hctor Gmez (murdered on 22 March 1997); (7) Gilberto Casas Arboleda, Norberto Casas Arboleda, Alcides de Jess Palacios Arboleda and Argiro de Jess Betancur Espinosa (murdered on 11 February 1997); (8) Bernardo Orrego Orrego (murdered on 6 March 1997); (9) Jos Isidoro Leyton (murdered on 25 March 1997); (10) Magaly Pearanda (murdered on 27 July 1997); (11) David Quintero Uribe (murdered on 4 August 1997); (12) Eduardo Enrique Ramos Montiel (murdered on 14 July 1997); (13) Libardo Cullar Navia (murdered on 23 July 1997); (14) Wenceslao Varela Torrecilla (murdered on 29 July 1997); (15) Abraham Figueroa Bolaos (murdered on 25 July 1997); (16) Edgar Camacho Bolaos (murdered on 15 July 1997); and (17) Ramn Osorio (disappeared on 15 April 1997). The', 'officials and members are concerned, the outcome of the procedures in terms of convictions is virtually nil and that only in exceptional cases are the facts clarified, the culprits identified and the full rigour of the law applied, requests the Government to make a substantial effort to combat the extremely serious and intolerable situation of impunity, which is one of the main reasons for the violence, and to keep it informed of developments.Allegations examined in November 1999(g) Regarding the alleged acts of violence against trade union officials and members (murders, disappearances, physical aggression, kidnappings and death threats) listed in the annex to this report, which the Government states are being investigated and on which it will inform the Committee of developments, the Committee, while expressing its concern and deeply regretting all these incidents, requests the Government to keep it informed of the findings of all the inquiries currently in progress.(h) Regarding the alleged death threats against: (1) members of the executive board of the Titn SA workers\' trade union of the municipality of Yumbo, (2) members of the executive board of the South Bolivr Agricultural and Mining Workers\' Association, (3) Oscar Arturo Orozco, Hernn de Jess Ortiz, (4) Wilson Garca Quiceno, (5) Henry Ocampo, (6) Sergio Daz, (7) Fernando Cardona, (8) Aguirre Restrepo Oscar, (9) Arrango Alvaro Alberto, (10) Varrio Castao Horacio, (11) Franco Jorge Humberto, (12) Giraldo Hctor de Jess, (13) Gutirrez Jairo Humberto, (14) Restrepo Luis Norberto, and (15) Jorge Elicer Marn Trujillo, the Committee urges the Government to provide the necessary protection for these trade union leaders and stresses the need for all these threats to be reported to the Public Prosecutor. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiries on the disappearances of Alexander Cardona and Mario Jimnez.(i) The Committee notes that the Government has assigned the cases of the raiding of the headquarters of the Executive Committee of the CUT-Atlntico and the aggression of a trade unionist to the Prosecutor\'s office to carry out an inquiry. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. With regard to the raiding of the premises of the FENSUAGRO and the surveillance of its President by the armed forces, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that an inquiry is established and to keep it informed in this regard.(j) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the administrative inquiry into the possible violation of the collective agreement in Brinks de Colombia SA.(k) Regarding the court proceedings concerning dismissals in the Textilia Ltda. company initiated by Germn Bulla and Daro Ramrez, the Committee expects that the judicial authorities will hand down their judgement in the near future and requests the Government to communicate to it the final outcome of the said proceedings.New allegations(l) The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations without delay on all the new allegations recently presented by the ICFTU, CUT, CTC, USO and ASODEFENSA.\n5.The Committee last examined this case at its March 1999 meeting (see 314th Report, paras. 4-41). The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) sent new allegations in communications dated 28 April, 29 July, 9 and 11 August and 3 September 1999. The Single Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CUT) sent new allegations in communications dated 27 April, 10 June, 27 July and 31 August 1999. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) sent additional information on 9 June 1999. The World Confederation of Labour sent communications dated 17 February and 2 March 1999 in support of the earlier communications by CLAT. The Single Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CUT), the General Confederation of Democratic Workers (CGTD) and the Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CTC) sent a joint communication dated 9 April 1999. The Government sent its observations in communications dated 4 and 23 March, 2 June, 12 August and 23 September 1999. At its meeting for the adoption of its report, the Committee was informed that a communication from the Government was received in the ILO on 11 November 1999. In conformity with its usual practice, the Committee did not take this communication into consideration at its present meeting as it was received too late.\n6.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n91.The Committee notes that the allegations presented by the complainants refer to extremely serious acts of violence against trade union officials and trade union members (murders (more than 100), attempted murders, disappearances, physical aggression, death threats) and acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee expresses once more its serious concern in relation to these incidents and particularly those which caused the loss of life, the first premise of all rights.\n92.In respect of the general situation in the country, the Committee takes note of the complainants\' statements that the situation in terms of violation of human and labour rights has worsened in recent months and that there is no peace process in Colombia and that contacts for initiating dialogue between the Government and the guerrillas can be achieved only with considerable difficulty. Regarding labour rights, the Committee takes note of the complainants\' particular allegation that the Government is preparing a new reform for greater labour flexibility without taking into account the workers\' point of view or possible alternatives that they might offer. They also allege, although not necessarily attributing them to anti-union motives, mass dismissals both in the central administration and in regional authorities and delays in payment of wages and social benefits to workers, including extreme cases of delays in wage payment of up to 12 months.\n93.The Committee notes that the Government, in response to the complainants\' allegations on the non-existence of a peace process, asserts that there is a process directed towards a political solution to the conflict with the majority of the guerrilla groups operating in Colombia. The FARC affirms the existence of compromises with the ELN and considers that the murders and other violations of basic rights are not directed specifically against trade union bodies but against other groups as well. The Committee notes that the Government adds that the national and international communities have recognized the significance of the process itself and have applauded and supported the courage with which the national Government is advancing it, and takes note of the various mechanisms listed by the Government as measures to curb the violence: (1) a national policy of combating the self-defence forces through a Coordination Centre for Combating the Self-Defence Forces, support to the Office of the Procurator-General, an early-warning system and humanitarian agreements; (2) a peace process with FARC-EP with the establishment of a Joint Agenda for Change towards a New Colombia; and (3) a peace process with the ELN, with a resolution declaring the peace process open and recognizing the political nature of that organization.\n94.The Committee also notes that the Government points to countless difficulties amidst which the process has to proceed: the activities of the FARC, to improve its bargaining position, has increased its aggression against small cities in various regions and left death and destruction in its wake; the activities of the ELN with its strategy of mass civilian kidnappings, an activity, which according to the Government, has been condemned on several occasions by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; the AUC (United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia), which has developed its criminal activities in various regions of the country with alleged guerrilla presence or influence, murdered dozens of poor settlers and peasants, forced hundreds of survivors to flee their homes and extended its crime wave to the big cities, carrying out selective murders and making death threats against individuals and social groups; the fact that the violence and the armed conflict affect the whole country generally, but that its consequences are more serious in certain regions (affecting mainly a specific sector of the population) where all the objective factors of the conflict are present; the fact that, for reasons related to the armed conflict and the peace process, the Government no longer exercises effective control over some parts of the national territory and population; the fact that the Colombian conflict has created the phenomenon of the internal displacement of persons which affects between 700,000 and 1,200,000 persons. The Committee notes that despite all of this, the national Government reiterates its desire to find a political solution to the armed conflict in order to put a stop to the killing by Colombians of their brother Colombians and to put all of the State\'s efforts into economic growth with equality, that is to say with social justice. The Committee notes the Government\'s observations on the ""Plan Colombia"" which has the objective of eradicating violence while focusing on its most fundamental clauses and which is aimed at creating more favourable structural conditions to achieve peace. The Committee takes notes of the Government\'s policy in favour of preventive action and protection of human rights of']"

It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February 2016 have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. 98.\n74.In an additional communication of 31 May 2017, the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March 2016 in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of 42 per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by 25 per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in 2019. As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.\n75.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March 2017. As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section 10 of the Education Finance Act (No. 26075), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. 457/2007. By a decision of 5 April 2017, the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section 10 of Act No. 26075. The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May 2017.\n76.The UDA adds that on 3 March 2017 the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for 6 and 7 March 2017. As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on 6 March 2017 secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On 15 March 2017, the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n77.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. 1/2015/1757059/2017).\n78.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on 60,000 volunteers to give educational support to the almost 5 million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March 2017, at the start of the 2017 academic year.\n79.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of 3 March 2017 to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos 10149 and 13552. The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.\n80.In its communication dated 10 February 2017, FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No. 8847 and Decree No. 228 of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March 2016 for every employee covered by Act No.4934 and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.\n81.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some 10 to 20 per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.\n82.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January 1992 the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No. 24049 concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of', '69.The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated 16 November 2016 and 31 May and 24 October 2017 (Case No. 3248); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated 10 February and 12 April 2017 (Case No. 3257); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated 5 April and 24May 2017 and 13 February 2018 (Case No. 3272).\n70.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April 2017 and February and March 2018.\n71.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos 3248, 3257 and 3272 will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n72.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151), and the Collective Bargaining Convention, 1981 (No. 154).\n73.In a communication of 16 November 2016, the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of 2016.

As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section 10 of the Education Finance Act (No. 26075), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. 457/2007. By a decision of 5 April 2017, the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section 10 of Act No. 26075. The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May 2017.\n76.The UDA adds that on 3 March 2017 the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for 6 and 7 March 2017. As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on 6 March 2017 secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On 15 March 2017, the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n77.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. 1/2015/1757059/2017).\n78.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on 60,000 volunteers to give educational support to the almost 5 million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March 2017, at the start of the 2017 academic year.\n79.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of 3 March 2017 to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos 10149 and 13552. The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.\n80.In its communication dated 10 February 2017, FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No. 8847 and Decree No. 228 of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March 2016 for every employee covered by Act No.4934 and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.\n81.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some 10 to 20 per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.\n82.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January 1992 the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No. 24049 concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of', '69.The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated 16 November 2016 and 31 May and 24 October 2017 (Case No. 3248); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated 10 February and 12 April 2017 (Case No. 3257); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated 5 April and 24May 2017 and 13 February 2018 (Case No. 3272).\n70.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April 2017 and February and March 2018.\n71.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos 3248, 3257 and 3272 will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n72.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151), and the Collective Bargaining Convention, 1981 (No. 154).\n73.In a communication of 16 November 2016, the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of 2016. It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February 2016 have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. 98.\n74.In an additional communication of 31 May 2017, the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March 2016 in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of 42 per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by 25 per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in 2019. As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.\n75.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March 2017.

However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)\tRegarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in 2007, the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)\tRegarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on 24 February 2008, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for 4 November 2011 and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)\tObserving the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. 87.(f)\tRegarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)\tThe Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)\tThe Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)\tRegarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)\tRegarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(k)\tRegarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence, the Committee reiterates the conclusions, recommendations and principles contained in its previous examination of the case and requests the Government to reply in detail to the allegations concerning the financing of parallel organizations and of favouritism vis--vis EMPREVEN and the  social production companies' and the discrimination against private companies. Regarding the IOE s new allegations concerning the sending of electronic mails between senior officials and parallel employers' organizations, the Committee calls on the Government to verify without delay with the senior officials concerned whether or not they or their representatives sent the electronic mail attached to the IOE s deposition.(l)\tRegarding the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill, the Committee calls on the Government to ensure respect for the abovementioned principle as regards international financial assistance to workers' and employers' organizations so that, if the Bill does indeed apply to them, to take the necessary measures without delay to amend the Bill (or the Act) so as to guarantee explicitly the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to receive international financial assistance without prior authorization from the authorities for activities related to the promotion and defence of the interests of their members.(m)\tRegarding the complainant organization s comments on the Central Planning Commission Act, the Committee had observed in its earlier examination of the case that the legislation establishes strong state intervention in the economy and national economic structure under the aegis of central planning in order to construct the Venezuelan socialist model and had requested the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos 87 and 98. The Committee reiterates this recommendation and indicates that if the organizations have not done"", ""Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n852.In its previous examination of the case in March 2012, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see 363rd Report, para. 1358]:(a)\tRegarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for 20 October 2011 and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)\tRegarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation.

The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in 2010 of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to 14 years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on 26 February 2008.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March 2014, in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October 2015, and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of the managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings; and, in view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial, and it invites the complainant organizations to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.(g) As regards the allegations of the detention of the president of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the president of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, and allegations of shadowing and harassment of the president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Jorge Roig, given the divergences between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.(h) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November 2014, of 50 decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee regrets that the Government has not made any observation concerning their impact on social dialogue and, deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, it firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.(i) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(j) The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated 20 May 2016, in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December 2015, without consultation with the social partners, of 29 national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February 2016; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March 2016. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.(k)""]"

The CGTP forwarded fresh allegations by letters of 31 August 1999 and 9 June 2000, and the FETRAPEP in a communication of 6 June 2000. The Government responded by letter of 1 February, 27 April and 12 September 2000.\n432.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n433.In its communication of 3 August 1999, the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) alleges that article 11 of Emergency Decree No. 011-99, published on 14 March 1999, established that, in 1999, state enterprises would conduct their pay policy for staff, whether covered by collective bargaining or not, through the award of a single productivity bonus which would not constitute a part of their basic remuneration and would be governed by resolution of the Ministry of Economics and Finance. In accordance with the aforementioned article, Ministerial Resolution No. 075-99-EF was published on 10 April 1999; this set the guidelines for the award of the Single Productivity Bonus (BUP), as well as the guidelines for simplifying the pay system of workers in state enterprises. The requirements established by the resolution for the award of the bonus in state enterprises were as follows: (a) the amount to be awarded should be set in accordance with the worker\'s level of responsibility, contribution and commitment, as reflected in an evaluation process conducted prior to the award; the evaluation criteria may be approved solely by the directorate, i.e. without the involvement of the trade union; (b) the resulting amount may be paid in instalments; (c) prior to this, the pay system must have been simplified on the basis of only two structural components (basic remuneration and consolidated bonus) and the integral remuneration agreements must have been signed in cases where remuneration exceeds 5,600 nuevo sols; (d) in the case of staff covered by collective bargaining, bonuses must be set and awarded as part of the collective bargaining process; and (e) a worker\'s total present income plus bonus (which as such may not be considered as a pay increase) may under no circumstances exceed the Maximum Income Level (TMI) established for the general manager or equivalent official in each enterprise. Similarly, the award of the BUP will depend in the last instance upon the extent to which the management objectives have been achieved, as set out in the management agreement concluded between the state enterprise and the Office of State Institutions and Bodies (OIOE), as stipulated by articles 10 and 11 of the aforementioned Ministerial Resolution. Those agreements specifically state the enterprise\'s commitments and the productivity bonus entitlement, provided that a high percentage of the planned objectives for 1999 are achieved, failing which, no authorization will be issued to make bonus payments subject to the limits set in the agreement.\n434.Furthermore, in accordance with the regulations applicable to collective bargaining, as cited by the CGTP, the directorates of state enterprises must submit to the OIOE, for its approval, the agreements signed with trade unions; this is required by Act No. 27012, the Public Sector Budget Act; this constitutes a further encroachment upon the parties\' collective independence, above and beyond the constraints imposed by that instrument.\n435.According to the CGTP, the strategy of placing the productivity bonus award exercise within the collective bargaining process is part of a policy gradually to replace the increases or compensation agreed upon with the workers. This constitutes an attempt to obviate the bargaining phase which, at present, addresses increases in remuneration, with implications in terms of compensation for service time, allowances, leave and others, in an endeavour to move on to the stage of regulating non-remuneration-related increases without any positive implications for workers\' rights and, apparently, without any extra labour costs for enterprises and with a further reduction in the Peruvian workers\' standard of living.\n436.Accordingly, organizations such as the Federation of National Ports Enterprise Workers (FENTENAPU) and the Union of SEDEPAL Workers (SUTESAL) were coerced into signing their collective agreements with the respective state enterprises under the conditions imposed by the aforementioned instructions which, hence, limit the agreements regarding wage increases and, in particular, remuneration-related increases for the benefit of their members.\n437.Furthermore, the members of the National Unified Federation of Health Workers (FENUTSSA) received a clear refusal from the Ministry of Health to negotiate upon the list of claims they presented this year, with the argument that, this year, the education sector required extra finances for the purpose of increasing the pay of administrative staff in various regions of the country. Similarly, the list of claims presented to the Ministry of Education by the United Education Trade Union of Peru (SUTEP), the Unified Trade Union of Education Centre Workers (SUTACE) and the National Federation of Education Administrative Workers (FENTASE) was disregarded upon grounds similar to those invoked in the health sector. All of this occurred despite the fact that salaries of public servants in health and education have been frozen for several years.\n438.In its communication dated 31 August 1999, the CGTP alleges that on 19 July 1999 the Government handed over the railways of the state enterprise ENAFER S.A. to a consortium of private companies with domestic and foreign capital. This meant the dismissal of all workers already having undergone three staff rationalization operations involving more than 4,000 lay-offs since 1991. The dismissals constitute a case of abuse by the Government, given that a technical study by the World Bank indicates that the staff necessary for the enterprise to function is 1,859 workers. The new operator is only required to recruit former ENAFER S.A. workers to meet its own needs; the recruitment is for one year and may be carried out directly or through third parties. In this way, the majority of the 1,772 workers will lose their jobs whereas they are above 40 years of age and, also, the majority of those that manage to be recruited will be so by third parties. The CGTP points out that the offers made to the trade unions by ENAFER S.A. to bring about their acceptance of the terminations was to pay compensation to the tune of 186 nuevo sols (less than US$60) in respect of each year of service - which is equivalent to the present basic wage of an ENAFER S.A. worker with 25 to 30 years of service. This remuneration is lower than the minimum remuneration for the purpose of calculating compensation, which is currently set at 370 nuevo sols per year of service and an indemnity of $1,000. The enterprise\'s proposals were turned down.\n439.The railway union representatives made a counter-proposal: recruitment guarantees for a minimum of five years; an increase in basic remuneration comprising 186 nuevo sols of basic wage, an ""economic package"" of 500 nuevo sols per month that had already been paid; a compensatory bonus of $5,000, etc. This counter-proposal was rejected and ENAFER S.A. sent out notarial letters to each of the 1,772 workers. These letters invited them to accept its proposal, setting a deadline of 19 August 1999 for the return of the signed letters, failing which they were threatened with termination as part of a collective dismissal already accepted by the Ministry of Labour, with the loss of the $1,000 indemnity and with not being included in the list of workers to be supplied to the new operator for recruitment purposes. The CGTP adds that, in these circumstances, it was agreed to call a strike on 20 August 1999. On 25 August, the Government initiated indiscriminate, unjustified and brutal repression of railway workers, their spouses and children camping out around the railway stations of Chosica (Lima), Cuzco and Arequipa. This violent repression left many people injured with contusions and instances of asphyxia, above all amongst the children and women on account of the large quantity of tear gas used by the police. In Cuzco, 75 workers were detained. On 26 August, there was industrial action in Lima, organized jointly by the telephone- and dockworkers\' unions, as well as in Arequipa and Chosica to protest at the police repression. Meetings were held with the chairpersons of the National Congress Labour and Transport Committees as well as with the Deputy Minister of Transport although, to date, the Government\'s position has remained unchanged and it has declared the strike illegal.\n440.In its communication of 1', 'Supreme Decree No. 016-91-TR of 11 March 1991 another regulation was issued under the Stability of Employment Act, which provides for a number of measures that overtly infringe the right to strike. Under section 7, subsection (c), the sudden stoppage of or interference with operations inside or outside the workplace is deemed to be an unjustified non-compliance with obligations and hence punishable by dismissal; and under section 15 the law enforcement officer on duty or his assistants or the police are responsible for verifying the occupation of premises and for identifying the workers who occupy the premises, for the purpose of their dismissal.\n445.In their communications dated 30 April 1992 and 14 May 1992, the Federation of Workers in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru and the Federation of Fishermen of Peru stated that on 2 April the Government, without consulting the parties concerned, promulgated Supreme Decree No. 040-92-TR, which provides that, as from 13 December 1991 - the date of entry into force of Legislative Decree No. 757 - collective contracts or agreements may not contain systems of automatic adjustment linked to price indexes.\n446.The complainants add that under the said decree it is mandatory to replace the systems of automatic wage adjustment by other systems that take into account the improvement of productivity and increase in output of every workplace, for which purpose a strict deadline of six months is prescribed as from the entry into force of the said Legislative Decree No. 757. Supreme Decree No. 040-92-TR not only requires workers to come to terms with their employers on the replacement of the system of calculating wages that had been achieved by means of a collective agreement, but also renders inoperative collective agreements as from 13 December 1991, the date on which Legislative Decree No. 757 entered into force, which constitutes a breach of specific ILO Conventions.\n447.In addition, in its communication of 25 June 1992 the Federation of Fishermen refers to the promulgation of Legislative Decree No. 25541 which, inter alia, declares inoperative all collective agreements that contain: clauses providing for the automatic adjustment of wages in the light of the fluctuation of prices; clauses providing for the adjustment of wages in the light of the value of foreign currency; and clauses providing for the adjustment of wages by a method analogous to that of the earlier systems.\n448.In their communication of 15 May 1992 various trade union organizations allege that draft legislation has been prepared, the provisions of which they consider to be in breach of the freedom of association. Specifically, the complainants criticize the following:- the provision fixing at an excessively high figure the minimum number of workers and organizations required for the purpose of establishing trade unions, federations and confederations;- the provision specifying and regulating the content of the statutes;- the provision requiring that a person must have performed trade union functions before qualifying for executive office;- the provision restricting the scope of collective bargaining to enterprise or sectoral level;- the provision debarring certain workers from exercising the right to collective bargaining;- the provision under which grievances may be submitted at the sectoral or branch level only;- the provision which impairs the employers\' duty to negotiate and restrict possible recourse to compulsory arbitration at the request of one of the parties;- the provision which defines the right to strike;- the provision which prescribes the form in which a strike may be carried out;- the provision specifying which personnel are indispensable for the resumption of work.\n449.Subsequently, by their communication of 6 July 1992, the complainants reported that the draft legislation referred to in their preceding communication had been definitively approved on 3 July 1992 by Legislative Decree No. 25593 concerning industrial relations. The complainants state that some of the provisions of the Legislative Decree contravene Conventions Nos. 87 and 98. They criticize in particular the following:- the authoritarian imposition of models to be followed for the organization of trade unions (section 5);- the provisions concerning public registration, outside supervision and the State\'s discretionary power to dissolve trade union organizations (sections 10 and 17);- the provision imposing institutional restrictions on trade union organizations (section 11);- the provisions restricting the freedom to join a trade union and the appointment of workers\' representatives (section 12, subsection (a), section 24, subsection (c), and section 12, subsection (d)):section 12 of the Legislative Decree, issued by the de facto regime imposed on Peru on 5 April last, stipulates in subsection (a) that in order to become a member of a trade union a person must be ""a worker of the enterprise, activity, occupation or office that is appropriate according to the type of union"";- the provision prescribing minimum conditions to be fulfilled in order that the trade union organizations may continue to exist (section 14):section 14 of Legislative Decree No. 25593 provides that ""in order that a trade union may be established and continue in existence it must have at least 20 members if it is an enterprise union, or 100 members if it is a union of a different kind"";- the provisions limiting the number of members of trade union executives (sections 31 and 32);- the provision prescribing predetermined time-limits for the period of validity of collective agreements (section 43, subsection (c));- the provision prescribing predetermined majorities as a condition of the validity of sectoral collective agreements (section 46);- the provision abolishing the right to information and freedom of opinion (section 55);- the provisions declaring void rights acquired by virtue of agreements and violating the principle of collective autonomy (fourth transitional provision, sections 66, 43(d), 62 to 65);- the provisions pursuant to which recourse to arbitration acts as a bar to the exercise of the right to strike (sections 61, 62, 63, 67 and 82);- the provision giving the authorities discretionary power to order a strike to be terminated (section 68);- the provision prescribing the conditions to be fulfilled before a strike may be declared (section 73, subsection (b));- the provisions restricting the lawful forms of strike (sections 81 and 85(b)):section 81 of Legislative Decree No. 25593 provides that ""this Legislative Decree does not protect irregular forms of action, such as sudden stoppages, halting operations in vital areas or sections of the enterprise, dissuasive action in the form of go-slow working or working to rule, deliberate reduction of output or any stoppage in the course of which the workers remain in the workplace, and obstruction of entry into the workplace"". Section 85 provides, in its subsection (c), that ""the strike will be declared unlawful ... if it takes any of the forms referred to in section 81"";- the provisions restricting strikes in what are described as essential public services (sections 83 and 82).\n450.In its communication of 30 June 1992 the Federation of Workers in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru states that, upon the dissolution of Parliament and ""intervention"" in the Judiciary, the Executive promulgated Legislative Decree No. 25541 in connection with the termination, by force of law, of the validity of collective agreements as from 13 December 1991. According to the said Decree:Agreements or clauses providing for automatic wage adjustments ceased to be operative on 13 December 1991, the system of wage indexation in force since 1946 in the electricity subsector being abolished; the pending collective negotiations are to be shelved; the parties or, failing agreement, the administrative authority responsible for labour questions will fix the general increment at the beginning of the negotiation; the Ministry of Labour is given regulatory power.\n451.The complainants further allege that in promulgating Legislative Decree No. 25567 of 20 June 1992 the Government violates the right to stability of employment, for that Decree declares a state of emergency for the public electricity service enterprises and prescribes time-limits for the termination of contracts of employment.\n452.In its communication of 14 July 1992, the Federation in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru, like the CGTP and the other complainant organizations, alleges that Legislative Decree No. 25593, promulgated on 2 July 1992, violates trade union rights.\n453.In its communication of 4 September 1992 the Federation of Workers in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru alleges that since the formation of the new Emergency and National Reconstruction Government many trade union leaders have been induced to give up their posts under the threat of dismissal without compensation. The Federation explains that persons who decline to accept redundancy schemes are placed on the list of surplus personnel whose contracts of employment are terminated by enforceable administrative procedures. Specifically, the complainant organization mentions a large number of trade union leaders who, it says, were dismissed or forced to leave and who are members of that Federation, of the Trade Union of Workers of the Lighting and Power Industry at Trujillo, the Trade Union of ELECTROPERU and allied enterprises, the Trade Union of ELECTROPERU at Chachapoyas and allied enterprises, the Trade Union of Workers in Public Register Offices, the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Labour, the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Trade Union', 'Supreme Decree No. 016-91-TR of 11 March 1991 another regulation was issued under the Stability of Employment Act, which provides for a number of measures that overtly infringe the right to strike.

SUTE CHILE reiterates that the Act does not respect current regulations for education assistant personnel, which recognize their rights to bargain collectively and to strike. Lastly, the organization alleges that, since the adoption of Act No. 21040, many complaints have been received from education workers in relation to mass dismissals.\n273.In its communications dated 31 July 2017 and 12 December 2017, which refer to both cases, the Government provides information about: (i) the Chilean school system and the reasons for improving the municipal system of public education; (ii) the situation of education assistants in the municipal sector, which is the subject of the current complaints; and (iii) the protection of the personnel concerned with respect to trade union rights and collective bargaining. It appends to its response a document from May 2016 entitled  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May 2016, Official Gazette No. 10368-04).\n274.The Government explains that the country s school system is a mixed, public rivate system of provision composed of four types of establishment that report to different entities: municipal (public) establishments, subsidized private establishments, unsubsidized private establishments and establishments with delegated administration. The municipal establishments to which the present case refers are administered by two types of management structure: Municipal Education Administration Departments or Municipal Education Directorates (DAEMs or DEMs), on the one hand, and municipal corporations on the other. DAEMs and DEMs are bodies that belong directly to the municipality; their functions are restricted to the administration of municipal educational establishments, which includes human and pedagogical resource management and administrative management. Municipal corporations are non-profit, private law entities with their own legal personality. Each has a board of directors presided over by the mayor of the respective commune. The general aim of municipal corporations is to administer the education, health and social development of the commune, carrying out functions in different areas of municipal life (education, health, children s services, etc.). On the basis of various studies on the topic, the Government considers that the municipal public education sector is not in a position to permanently ensure terms of administration and resource management that would guarantee the quality, improvement and future protection of public education across the entire country. Accordingly, the proposal contained in the draft act ' which was adopted on 24 November 2017 (Act No. 21040) ' envisages the creation of a national system of public education structured around local public education services. These entities belong to the State Administration and assume the form of decentralized public services specialized in education management, which provide administrative, technical and pedagogical support to the school establishments under them. Lastly, the Government declares that it has held a permanent dialogue with almost all stakeholders and unions in school education, in particular, in relation to the draft act establishing the public education system. The unions consulted include the National Council of Education Assistants, the main representative of that segment of workers in municipalized education, which is composed of various federations and confederations of education assistants' associations and unions from the whole Chilean municipal sector (including FENASICOM).\n275.Regarding the situation of education assistants (prior to the reform), the Government indicates that they work in one or more educational establishments and carry out functions other than teaching, which might be professional, technical, administrative, auxiliary or service tasks. Education assistants across the municipal sector are governed by Act No. 19464 and also by the Labour Code. The legislation distinguishes their right to association on the basis of the employing entity. For education assistants contracted by DAEMs or DEMs ' i.e. directly by municipalities ' section 60 of Act No. 19464 establishes that they are subject to Act No. 19296 on civil servants' associations. In the case of municipal corporations, section 14 of the same Act No. 19464 grants education assistants the right to bargain collectively in accordance with the Labour Code, permitting an exception for this group of workers to the prohibition set out in section 304 of the Code. According to the Government, the new public education system provided for by the law does not alter the contractual and labour regime of education assistants who work in educational establishments under the authority of municipal corporations or directly for municipalities. In addition, it does not establish requirements or selection processes for transferring all education assistants from municipalities and corporations to future local public education services. The Government asserts that the main modification proposed by the draft act in relation to that sector of workers is to change the employer responsible for contracting education assistants: such employers will assume a single (public) nature, ending the current dichotomy between municipal corporations and municipalities. The Government emphasizes that a key focus of the draft act is ensuring the employment continuity of all workers associated with the provision of public education, meaning that transferred employees will have no break in their employment and will keep their wages and welfare rights. The Government stresses that the  no break in service' transfer model, established in the draft act, means that workers will lose neither their legal rights nor any rights acquired under agreement with the respective municipality or municipal corporation prior to their transfer, including those acquired by tacit agreement. The Government specifies that, in addition to the Administrative Statute, various statutes or specific provisions are applicable to public sector workers according to the nature of their activity. This is true of education assistants, who have their own regulations and statute.\n276.Regarding the protection of the union rights of the personnel concerned, the Government states that, firstly, workers have the right to join unions under article 19(19) of the national Constitution. However, the legislation on the public sector establishes a relevant exception in article 84 of the Administrative Statute, which prohibits civil servants from joining or belonging to trade unions in the field of the State Administration. Notwithstanding the above, the Government considers that the State recognizes and respects the freedom of association of State Administration workers, who have their right to form civil servants' associations recognized, the only condition being that they abide by the law and the statutes of the associations, in accordance with Act No. 19296 on civil servants' associations. According to the Government, these associations have, in practice, operated in a similar way to trade unions, meaning that the right to organize of workers has also been respected in the public sector. The Government indicates that freedom of association and the representation of labour interests are exercised differently by public sector workers than by private sector workers, but that that does not mean that the rights do not exist or that there are no mechanisms in place for their enjoyment. Moreover, based on the variant regulations and characteristics of the public employment system, the new Act provides that workers should, pursuant to the reform and the resulting change in labour law, transform their trade unions and form civil servants' associations. The Act grants a period of two years starting from the date of education service transfer for the trade unions representing the transferred personnel to merge, amend their statutes in accordance with Act No. 19296 on civil servants' associations and switch to being governed by such provisions for all legal purposes following the submission of the amended statutes to the Labour Inspectorate. In that regard, the Government underscores that the Act grants existing trade unions the opportunity to adapt to public sector regulations. It thus guarantees that educational assistant workers will not, at any point during the transfer process, be unprotected with respect to their right to organize and right to representation before the authorities and their employer. The Government stresses that trade unions that do not make use of their right to adapt will remain as such and will not lose their legal personality or forego their legal existence in so far as national legislation does not permit the dissolution of unions by a decision of the administrative authority. According to the Government, the reform affects not the trade union rights themselves, but rather the way in which they are guaranteed. Once the assistants become State employees, their right to organize starts being governed by Act No. 19296 establishing regulations on State Administration civil servants' associations. In fact, section 7(a) of the Act explicitly indicates that one of the main purposes of civil servants' associations will be to promote the advancement of their members' economic, living and working conditions.\n277.Regarding the right to bargain collectively, the Government makes a distinction between the right to bargain, on the one hand, and collective bargaining regulated by the Labour Code, on the other. Public sector workers bargain centrally in some cases and on a sectorial basis in others. It is reasonable that general working conditions ' which are established by law ' tend to be"", ""to develop that was hardly suitable for the negotiations planned for October of that year between Lan Chile S.A. and the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians of Lan Chile S.A. It should be noted that this situation developed following the attack and destruction of the Twin Towers in the United States, and that this incident obviously had an effect on some of the events denounced by the trade union, but does not provide a single or sufficient explanation.\n328.The Government then lists a series of events which, as it points out, constitute anti-union practices.Individual bargaining between the enterprise and pilots\n329.During the second quarter of 2001, the enterprise created subsidiary enterprises to which some unionized pilots were transferred following individual bargaining, which provided them with access to improved financial conditions, and their withdrawal of trade union membership. This process was public knowledge and was even encouraged by company executives.Publicity campaign against collective bargaining\n330.The atmosphere being experienced within Lan Chile S.A. was made known to the public through articles in the press that appeared repeatedly from August 2001 onwards. These articles pointed out that the collective bargaining process to be carried out by the pilots was a threat to the entreprise and to the country s economy given that the bargaining appeared to be intrinsically linked to conflicts and paralysis. These conclusions stem from articles that appeared in the  El Mercurio' newspaper during August 2001.\n331.In a public notice, the trade union s executive board qualified these articles in the press as a campaign against the trade union in order to discredit the workers' organization and discourage collective bargaining by generating a negative public opinion. The trade union responded by implementing the industrial action entitled  work-to-rule'  consisting in fulfilling the provisions of aeronautical regulations to the letter. This obviously involved the non-infringement of applicable standards, but also involved straying from the usual practices employed by the enterprise in air navigation processes, and which are outside the regulations, in order to cut costs for fuel and other consumables.Mass dismissal of active trade union members\n332.These events were followed by the mass dismissal of unionized pilots. Between 14 September and 4 October 2001, the company dismissed 108 members. In 23 of these cases the company invoked  company requirements' as the reason for the dismissals and in 85 cases it invoked the  serious breach of contractual obligations'  When the enterprise describes the serious breach of contractual obligations, it refers, inter alia, to confusing situations which led to delays for some flights. However, there is no clear relationship between the delays and the breach of contracts or internal regulations.\n333.Following the dismissal of these 85 workers, the company reinstated 40 of them. Amongst those not reinstated were eight former trade union directors and workers who participated in the 1995 legal strike. Therefore, the measure was highly discriminatory given that, in essence, it affected the most active members of the organization, namely those who were dismissed for respecting a trade union agreement consisting in  work-to-rule'  without violating contractual or legal standards.\n334.The 37 workers affected filed a motion to vacate the dismissals before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago, filed under  Bustamante and Others versus Lan Chile S.A.' (Case No. 5196-2000).Reduction in the workers' negotiating power\n335.The dismissals prior to the commencement of collective bargaining had repercussions on the collective bargaining process promoted by the trade union in that only 111 members participated. This represents a 200 per cent reduction in the number of participants compared with the previous collective bargaining process. The process was concluded without a strike and a four-year collective agreement was signed, with a 56 per cent reduction in the pay increase that otherwise would have been due. At the same time, the entreprise came to an agreement with three groups of pilots, who during the previous negotiation process formed part of the trade union, in the form of 62-month collective agreements with a lower pay adjustment.Pressure exerted by Lan Chile S.A. for thewithdrawal of trade union membership\n336.Following inspections by the employment services during the course of 2001, it was established that unionized pilots and technicians were subjected to intense pressure aimed at making them withdraw membership from their trade union organization. This is shown in documents and communications issued by the employer which offer improved conditions of work that are incompatible with continued trade union membership. This approach was also reflected in the implicit threats of dismissal that were made by some supervisors and acknowledged by some workers during conversations with the officer from the Labour Inspectorate. As a result, the trade union executive board received membership withdrawals from mid-2001 until the first-quarter of 2002; it currently has only 71 members.Discrimination against trade unionmembers with regard to training\n337.Lan Chile S.A. excluded trade union members from flight training for operating the new company airplanes. This was subsequently taken up by the trade union executive board with the employer, but this measure was not reversed. In the past, training was considered a recompense for pilots' seniority. According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the enterprise, such exclusion became apparent shortly before the collective bargaining process began. According to the information provided by the trade union executive board, this segregation still continues during the present year.Conditions for the reinstatement of dismissed pilots\n338.According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the company in 2001, 40 pilots dismissed for disciplinary reasons, for having participated in the action entitled  work-to-rule'  were reinstated by the employer with the condition that they write a letter in which they had to acknowledge responsibility for the possible damage the industrial action may have caused; furthermore, they had to blame the trade union for forcing them into the alleged transgression. With their new individual contracts, these pilots did not regain the collective benefits that they had previously enjoyed.Replacement of dismissed unionized pilotsby recruiting foreign pilots\n339.The company failed to comply when requested for information by the inspectors in order to determine the legality of such recruitment. As a result of this conduct, the enterprise was fined on three occasions, on the most recent occasion, it was given the maximum administrative sanction for hindering the labour inspector s work.Harassment of trade union officials: Failure to grant thework agreed upon and professional disqualification\n340.In August 2001, a complaint was made about the suspension from everyday duties of the trade union directors, Messrs. Nibaldo Jorquera and Artidoro Leal, and Lan Chile S.A. was sanctioned for failing to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contract. This also happened to the official Baldovino Bendix.\n341.This conduct began to take the form of excluding trade union officials from work schedules, which are documents used to notify each pilot of his flight itinerary, rest periods, training activities and other events for the following month. The collective agreement obliges the employer to provide this document.\n342.In January 2002, another administrative fine was issued for failing to provide the officials Jozcef Szita, Artidoro Leal, Nibaldo Jorquera and Baldovino Bendix with work schedules and for failing to grant the first two mentioned officials the agreed upon work.\n343.It should be pointed out that, according to the provisions of the Civil Aeronautical Authority, in order to keep their license, pilots must be accredited with a determined number of flight hours. Without such a license they cannot work as pilots or co-pilots. In practice this amounts to professional disqualification and makes it impossible for them to work for this, or another, aviation company since they fail to meet the essential requirements.\n344.Moreover, the Government indicates the effects of the action taken by Lan Chile S.A. which constitutes anti-union and unfair practices in collective bargaining:' Trade union membership. After having been the most representative union and bringing together nearly all of the pilots and technicians at Lan Chile S.A., with 400 members, the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians now has only 71 members, as a result of the dismissals, membership withdrawals and creation of subsidiary enterprises.' Trade union executive board. In October 2001, the trade union executive board was composed of five members. In the first-quarter of 2002, only one director remained in service since three officials left the company, in one case following legal proceedings which lead to an agreement, and in the other cases following out-of-court negotiations. The last reorganization of the executive board, on 16 May 2001, only enabled the election of three directors.' Trade union assets. In view of the reduction in membership, the trade union stopped receiving a significant amount of resources, in the form of trade union dues. Therefore, the trade union was forced to move to smaller headquarters and reduce the number of officers and advisers.' Collective bargaining. The collective bargaining of pilots, which until 2001 had been carried out exclusively by the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians, was significantly fragmented during the last negotiating process, and therefore led to fewer collective benefits. Moreover, by negotiating separately, three groups signed instruments for 62 months, whereas the trade"", 'that a request be made with ten days\' notice for authorisation by the Chief of the area under the state of emergency to hold meetings in public places. The National Grouping of Workers (CNT) satisfied these requirements but did not even receive an acknowledgement in reply. In view of this situation, the CNT leadership called on the workers and the population of Santiago to meet on the Plaza de los Hroes on 1 May at 11 a.m.\n273.The report also indicates that on 29 April the authorities had prevented the holding of an artistic and cultural event at union premises of the Confederation of Leather and Footwear Workers to celebrate May Day.\n274.On 1 May the city of Santiago was practically occupied by the police and the military. In spite of this climate, thousands of people approached the meeting place and, when the first groups formed, the police forces hurled projectiles and tear gas at them. Dozens of persons were wounded. All persons and all vehicles were checked and approximately 600 persons arrested, including Manuel Bustos, Vice-President of the CNT, Jorge Mills, a member of the national council of the CNT, and Humberto Arcos, an official of the Confederation of Unions of Workers in the Metal Industry. The majority of these persons were released on the same day with a summons to appear before the Police Court for having caused a disturbance of the peace.\n275.Also on the morning of 1 May, two trade union premises belonging to the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH) and to the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) were illegally searched. Furniture and documents were destroyed or removed. The persons present were threatened, certain of them were struck, and 56 teachers attending a meeting at the premises of the AGECH were arrested, although organisations with a legal personality (as in the case of the AGECH) are not required to request authorisation to hold meetings at their own premises to deal with matters within their competence.\n276.In its communication of 4 June 1986, the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) alleges that on 23 April 1986 the Director-General for Industrial Relations of the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO) notified 14 workers of the termination of their work contract on the basis of article 13(f) of Legislative Decree No. 2200. This provision permits an employer to dismiss workers without specifying the grounds for dismissal, with 30 days\' notice or by paying compensation of an amount equal to the last monthly wage. According to the CTC, this permits the Government and employers, as in this case, to take discriminatory measures against trade unions.\n277.The CTC states that all those affected by this measure were skilled workers, had behaved irreproachably and had from 8 to 29 years\' service in the undertaking. The only possible grounds for their dismissal are therefore their active participation in trade union meetings and activities. Furthermore, four of them were about to become trade union officials. Moreover, this measure was intended to intimidate the workers in the undertaking in order to impede their trade union action. These assumptions are substantiated by the fact that on the day of the dismissals, the two unions of El Salvador with the largest number of affiliates had convened assemblies for the purpose of putting their affairs in order following the disqualification of their leaders decreed by the Ministry of Labour. These assemblies unanimously rejected the dismissals and condemned the measure taken by CODELCO. For ten days, 13 of the dismissed workers went on hunger strike.\n278.In its communication of 11 June 1986, the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company of Chile states that on 17 April 1986 it presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on 30 April 1986, raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article 5 of Legislative Decree No. 2758. On 28 May 1986, after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the 475 members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union points out that the persons concerned are covered by an indefinite work contract and have more than 8 years\' continuous service in the undertaking. The union adds that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on 9 May 1986 a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicates that it submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.\n279.In its communication of 9 September 1986, the ICFTU alleges that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants\' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since 2 July 1986. On several occasions, armed and masked civilians conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers was rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home was again searched and his wife severely beaten.\n280.In its communication of 9 September 1986, the FISE refers to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE fears that his life is in danger.\n281.Works Union No. 6 of the National Copper Corporation of Chile states in its communication of 24 September 1986 that on 22 September police officers arrived at the Union\'s offices for the purpose of evicting the six workers referred to in a previous complaint presented by the Confederation of Copper Workers, as well as their families who had organised a soup kitchen on the premises since their dismissal by the National Copper Corporation, at a time when they enjoyed trade union ""immunity"". The police officer responsible for this eviction presented no document issued by a competent authority.\n282.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, refers to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation points out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, was sought by persons in civilian clothes on 8 September 1986, when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n283.CONSTRAMET indicates that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno were sought by the police as of the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency, 8 September 1986. Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, is under permanent surveillance, as are the Confederation\'s offices. The complainant organisation also indicates that the police authorities prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.\n284.FENTATREX refers to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explains that these officials were declared responsible for the fact that 30 of the 120 workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on 5 September 1986, as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which was occupied by law enforcement agents. The undertaking then arbitrarily applied sections 15.1 and 15.4 of Legislative Decree No. 2200 which penalises unlawful acts preventing the worker from being present at his work or discharging his obligations as a worker and the direction of or active participation in any unlawful interruption or stoppage of work. The dismissals were decided without notice being given, without the right to compensation and in contravention of ""trade union immunity"".\n285.FENTATREX indicates that 37 workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking had to take the risk of meeting in private houses to discuss a draft collective agreement since a consequence of the proclamation of the state of emergency was to prohibit meetings of trade unions which do not possess their own premises.\n286.The Miners\' Confederation alleges that several trade unionists were dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining: in particular, the former official of the Lota Union No. 6 of the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), Fresia Mellado Opazo, and ten workers of Union No, 1 of Victoria de Lbu. It is alleged further that an official of ENACAR Union No. 1, Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, was disqualified from holding his union post and that workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, including the trade union official Rolando Chacana Ganza, were arrested for purported thefts of explosives. Lastly, it is alleged that, at the Agustinas de Copiapo mine, the Agustinas mining enterprise unilaterally decided to lower salaries in 1984 and 1985 at a time when the collective agreement was in force.\n287.Finally, in a joint letter several Chilean national confederations indicate that the homes of officials of']"

The Government points out in general terms in that connection that employers\' and workers\' organisations are required to respect the law of the land as provided by Article 8 of Convention No. 87.\n244.The Government adds that the Constitution of Guatemala which entered into force in 1986 guarantees the application of the rights and freedoms defined in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98; that workers and employers have the right to exercise them in defence of their economic and social interests; and that the authorities, including the competent courts, are performing their constitutional duties within the framework of a State based on law. According to the Government all persons, including organisations covered by Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, can exercise their constitutional rights in conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic.\n245.In conclusion the Government states that it would be grateful if the Committee would include the foregoing observations in its final conclusions.\n246.In Case No. 1195 ICFTU alleges in a telegram of 12 March 1987 the death of Manuel de Jess Lpez Morales of the Electricity and Energy Trade Union, whose body had been found mutilated and covered with obvious marks of torture. The victim had been kidnapped a few days earlier by persons unknown. In addition, the trade unionists Jlio Martnez and Ricardo Bonilla of the Unified Trade Union Confederation of Guatemala (CUSG), affiliated to ICFTU, were said to have received death threats.\n247.In its communication of 23 March ICFTU furnishes detailed information on the foregoing allegations, indicating that the murders of certain trade union leaders were brought to its knowledge on 30 November 1986. Specifically ICFTU claims that the facts are as follows:- on 12 June 1986 Benjamn Borja Leonardo, a welder aged 35 years, is said to have disappeared while he was organising a trade union in Hoppy S.A., a banana company owned by Gustavo Anzueto Willman, a retired colonel;- on 21 June 1986 Gerardo Asaor Letona, a gardener in the Service Department of the Faculty of Science of the National and Autonomous University of San Carlos, is said to have been detained; his fate remains unknown;- in October 1986 Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, is said to have been pursued by paramilitary groups who broke into his home and, not finding him there, expressed the intention to murder him;- in rural areas armed civilian groups are said to continue terrorising the peasants on the pretext that they are suspected of opposition sympathies; the victims and their families are said not to be making this public for fear of reprisals.\n248.Furthermore 62 trade unions organised by an organisation affiliated to ICFTU are said to be waiting to receive legal personality from the Directorate-General of Labour.\n249.In addition the Guatemalan Institute of Social Studies and Training is said to be recruiting 1,170 educators for organising and educational duties among the workers of town and countryside; their wages are to be paid by the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development. The purpose of this measure is said to be to recruit state-paid educators in order to establish an official trade union confederation, as is said to be proved by an unsigned memorandum circulated to Christian Democrat deputies on 10 June 1986.\n250.Again: at the Guatemalan undertaking GUATEL, Mario Lpez Estrada, the manager, is said to support a body called the ""22 February Committee"" led by Ral Rodrguez, a member of the above-mentioned Institute. This committee is said to be a parallel organisation to the lawful trade union already present in the undertaking.\n251.In other instances, workers are said to have been subjected to measures of intimidation. Thus Pascual Ruch Hernndez, general secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of San Jos Nacahuil, is said to have been taken in for questioning by uniformed police without a warrant on three occasions. Luis Antonio Morn, general secretary of the Bran Canhuaco Rural Trade Union, is said to have been brutally beaten by a person in plain clothes during a union meeting and the complaint filed with the authorities against the attacker, who was identified, is said to have produced no result. The workers of ""Los Diamantes"" ranch in the Department of Escuintla are said to have reported threats uttered by the manager, who is said to be preventing them from establishing a trade union.\n252.Lastly four persons are said to have been murdered: Edgar de la Paz, aged 28 years, a railway employee and a member of the Railway Trade Union, kidnapped by a group of civilians who are said to have tied him to a tree, sprinkled petrol over him and burned him; Mara Luisa Recinos Satoj, a teacher aged 39 years, found dead after a week in captivity on a ranch at Siquinala, Department of Escuintla; an unidentified woman whose body is said to have been found bound hand and foot and bearing signs of torture and mutilation and who according to witnesses had been a manual worker; and a member of the Central Trade Union of Municipal Workers who died after being savagely beaten by persons unknown.\n253.In its reply of 27 April 1987 the Government categorically denies the existence of armed civilian groups threatening the peasants in rural areas. It states that no official complaints have been made to that effect. The Government affirms in the democratic process now under way, no one is subjected to persecution, and especially not sympathisers of opposition political groups.\n254.More specifically it states with regard to Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, who according to the complainants had been persecuted by paramilitary groups, that in the absence of a definite date and of a complaint it can institute no inquiries.\n255.With regard to the charges of denial of legal personality to certain trade unions, the Government transmits a list of the unions which have been recognised in 1987 and of those awaiting the signature of the Office of the President of the Republic. It adds that it will transmit as soon as possible a list of the associations in process of approval and an indication of the statutory conditions which they have not yet met.\n256.With regard to the charge concerning the alleged establishment of an official trade union confederation on the pretext of organising and educating the workers of town and countryside, the Government expresses concern at such misinformation and at the bad faith of the informants of international organisations. It explains that in reality the Ministry of Development has indeed recruited 1,170 rural and urban educators belonging to a community development association, a non-profit, non-governmental organisation specialising in vocational training and in the endeavour to attain even levels of development. The aim of the educators in question, however, according to the Government, is to support communal organisation in order to establish local development boards as part of the new structure at regional and local level. These local development boards are to work directly in agreement with the National Board of Urban and Rural Development, which will bring together those who function as decision-makers at the local level. It is therefore absurd to imagine that the human resources in question, for whose training the Ministry of Devlopment is responsible, are intended to set up an ""official trade union confederation"". The Government asks the Committee not to let itself be misled by the information given in the memorandum, which has nothing genuine about it.\n257.As to the charge concerning the alleged parallel trade union set up in the GUATEL undertaking, the Government states that ICFTU has submitted no evidence to warrant the assertion that the manager of GUATEL has supported the establishment of a committee parallel to the lawful trade union of the undertaking.\n258.With regard to the alleged measures of intimidation to which workers are said to have been subjected in the pursuit of their trade union activities, the Government states that, in the absence of exact dates for the alleged events, it is practically impossible for it to pin down the information covered by the complaints.\n259.Lastly, with regard to the alleged murders of trade unionists, the Government communicates the following information:- Edgar de la Paz, who according to the complainants was 28 years old and a railway employee, is said to be in reality Edgar Paz Tello, a worker in the area of the Permanent Way, and to belong in reality to the Rural Workers\' Union. According to the Government, the man himself stated in the national press that on the morning of 29 November, when he was drunk and had fallen asleep on the public highway, thieves robbed him of a cheque for 100 quetzales and his driving licence. They then sprinkled petrol over him and set fire to him. In a fainting condition, he claims, he was taken by several persons to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security, where he was given treatment and', 'of elections for new trade union leaders, and it was a matter of public knowledge at the date of the Government\'s reply that that trade union organisation had been left without legal representatives and that its activities had been suspended. The Government points out in general terms in that connection that employers\' and workers\' organisations are required to respect the law of the land as provided by Article 8 of Convention No. 87.\n244.The Government adds that the Constitution of Guatemala which entered into force in 1986 guarantees the application of the rights and freedoms defined in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98; that workers and employers have the right to exercise them in defence of their economic and social interests; and that the authorities, including the competent courts, are performing their constitutional duties within the framework of a State based on law. According to the Government all persons, including organisations covered by Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, can exercise their constitutional rights in conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic.\n245.In conclusion the Government states that it would be grateful if the Committee would include the foregoing observations in its final conclusions.\n246.In Case No. 1195 ICFTU alleges in a telegram of 12 March 1987 the death of Manuel de Jess Lpez Morales of the Electricity and Energy Trade Union, whose body had been found mutilated and covered with obvious marks of torture. The victim had been kidnapped a few days earlier by persons unknown. In addition, the trade unionists Jlio Martnez and Ricardo Bonilla of the Unified Trade Union Confederation of Guatemala (CUSG), affiliated to ICFTU, were said to have received death threats.\n247.In its communication of 23 March ICFTU furnishes detailed information on the foregoing allegations, indicating that the murders of certain trade union leaders were brought to its knowledge on 30 November 1986. Specifically ICFTU claims that the facts are as follows:- on 12 June 1986 Benjamn Borja Leonardo, a welder aged 35 years, is said to have disappeared while he was organising a trade union in Hoppy S.A., a banana company owned by Gustavo Anzueto Willman, a retired colonel;- on 21 June 1986 Gerardo Asaor Letona, a gardener in the Service Department of the Faculty of Science of the National and Autonomous University of San Carlos, is said to have been detained; his fate remains unknown;- in October 1986 Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, is said to have been pursued by paramilitary groups who broke into his home and, not finding him there, expressed the intention to murder him;- in rural areas armed civilian groups are said to continue terrorising the peasants on the pretext that they are suspected of opposition sympathies; the victims and their families are said not to be making this public for fear of reprisals.\n248.Furthermore 62 trade unions organised by an organisation affiliated to ICFTU are said to be waiting to receive legal personality from the Directorate-General of Labour.\n249.In addition the Guatemalan Institute of Social Studies and Training is said to be recruiting 1,170 educators for organising and educational duties among the workers of town and countryside; their wages are to be paid by the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development. The purpose of this measure is said to be to recruit state-paid educators in order to establish an official trade union confederation, as is said to be proved by an unsigned memorandum circulated to Christian Democrat deputies on 10 June 1986.\n250.Again: at the Guatemalan undertaking GUATEL, Mario Lpez Estrada, the manager, is said to support a body called the ""22 February Committee"" led by Ral Rodrguez, a member of the above-mentioned Institute. This committee is said to be a parallel organisation to the lawful trade union already present in the undertaking.\n251.In other instances, workers are said to have been subjected to measures of intimidation. Thus Pascual Ruch Hernndez, general secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of San Jos Nacahuil, is said to have been taken in for questioning by uniformed police without a warrant on three occasions. Luis Antonio Morn, general secretary of the Bran Canhuaco Rural Trade Union, is said to have been brutally beaten by a person in plain clothes during a union meeting and the complaint filed with the authorities against the attacker, who was identified, is said to have produced no result. The workers of ""Los Diamantes"" ranch in the Department of Escuintla are said to have reported threats uttered by the manager, who is said to be preventing them from establishing a trade union.\n252.Lastly four persons are said to have been murdered: Edgar de la Paz, aged 28 years, a railway employee and a member of the Railway Trade Union, kidnapped by a group of civilians who are said to have tied him to a tree, sprinkled petrol over him and burned him; Mara Luisa Recinos Satoj, a teacher aged 39 years, found dead after a week in captivity on a ranch at Siquinala, Department of Escuintla; an unidentified woman whose body is said to have been found bound hand and foot and bearing signs of torture and mutilation and who according to witnesses had been a manual worker; and a member of the Central Trade Union of Municipal Workers who died after being savagely beaten by persons unknown.\n253.In its reply of 27 April 1987 the Government categorically denies the existence of armed civilian groups threatening the peasants in rural areas. It states that no official complaints have been made to that effect. The Government affirms in the democratic process now under way, no one is subjected to persecution, and especially not sympathisers of opposition political groups.\n254.More specifically it states with regard to Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, who according to the complainants had been persecuted by paramilitary groups, that in the absence of a definite date and of a complaint it can institute no inquiries.\n255.With regard to the charges of denial of legal personality to certain trade unions, the Government transmits a list of the unions which have been recognised in 1987 and of those awaiting the signature of the Office of the President of the Republic. It adds that it will transmit as soon as possible a list of the associations in process of approval and an indication of the statutory conditions which they have not yet met.\n256.With regard to the charge concerning the alleged establishment of an official trade union confederation on the pretext of organising and educating the workers of town and countryside, the Government expresses concern at such misinformation and at the bad faith of the informants of international organisations. It explains that in reality the Ministry of Development has indeed recruited 1,170 rural and urban educators belonging to a community development association, a non-profit, non-governmental organisation specialising in vocational training and in the endeavour to attain even levels of development. The aim of the educators in question, however, according to the Government, is to support communal organisation in order to establish local development boards as part of the new structure at regional and local level. These local development boards are to work directly in agreement with the National Board of Urban and Rural Development, which will bring together those who function as decision-makers at the local level. It is therefore absurd to imagine that the human resources in question, for whose training the Ministry of Devlopment is responsible, are intended to set up an ""official trade union confederation"". The Government asks the Committee not to let itself be misled by the information given in the memorandum, which has nothing genuine about it.\n257.As to the charge concerning the alleged parallel trade union set up in the GUATEL undertaking, the Government states that ICFTU has submitted no evidence to warrant the assertion that the manager of GUATEL has supported the establishment of a committee parallel to the lawful trade union of the undertaking.\n258.With regard to the alleged measures of intimidation to which workers are said to have been subjected in the pursuit of their trade union activities, the Government states that, in the absence of exact dates for the alleged events, it is practically impossible for it to pin down the information covered by the complaints.\n259.Lastly, with regard to the alleged murders of trade unionists, the Government communicates the following information:- Edgar de la Paz, who according to the complainants was 28 years old and a railway employee, is said to be in reality Edgar Paz Tello, a worker in the area of the Permanent Way, and to belong in reality to the Rural Workers\' Union. According to the Government, the man himself stated in the national press that on the morning of 29 November, when he was drunk and had fallen asleep on the public highway, thieves robbed him of a cheque for 100 quetzales and his driving licence. They then sprinkled petrol over him and set fire to him. In a fainting condition, he claims, he was taken by several persons to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security, where he was given treatment and', 'of elections for new trade union leaders, and it was a matter of public knowledge at the date of the Government\'s reply that that trade union organisation had been left without legal representatives and that its activities had been suspended. The Government points out in general terms in that connection that employers\' and workers\' organisations are required to respect the law of the land as provided by Article 8 of Convention No. 87.\n244.The Government adds that the Constitution of Guatemala which entered into force in 1986 guarantees the application of the rights and freedoms defined in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98; that workers and employers have the right to exercise them in defence of their economic and social interests; and that the authorities, including the competent courts, are performing their constitutional duties within the framework of a State based on law. According to the Government all persons, including organisations covered by Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, can exercise their constitutional rights in conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic.\n245.In conclusion the Government states that it would be grateful if the Committee would include the foregoing observations in its final conclusions.\n246.In Case No. 1195 ICFTU alleges in a telegram of 12 March 1987 the death of Manuel de Jess Lpez Morales of the Electricity and Energy Trade Union, whose body had been found mutilated and covered with obvious marks of torture. The victim had been kidnapped a few days earlier by persons unknown. In addition, the trade unionists Jlio Martnez and Ricardo Bonilla of the Unified Trade Union Confederation of Guatemala (CUSG), affiliated to ICFTU, were said to have received death threats.\n247.In its communication of 23 March ICFTU furnishes detailed information on the foregoing allegations, indicating that the murders of certain trade union leaders were brought to its knowledge on 30 November 1986.

The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""\n369.In a communication received on 8 November 1985 the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.\n370.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from 12 to 16 January 1986. During the mission the Director-General\'s representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.\n371.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers\' organisations.\n372.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n373.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General\'s representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n374.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n418.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General\'s representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from 12 to 16 January 1986. The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May 1984, there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers\' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers\' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. 953, 973, 1016 and 1233(a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. 1150(a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. 1168(a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another 18 trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these 18 trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. 1258(a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. 1269(a) The Committee points to the principle', '366.At its February 1985 meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. 953, 973, 1016, 1150, 1168, 1233, 1258, 1269, 1273 and 1281, noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see 238th Report of the Committee, para. 21, approved by the Governing Board at its 229th Session (February-March 1985)).\n367.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May 1985, he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February 1985 meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. 0n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.\n368.In its 239th Report (May 1985), approved by the Governing Body at its 230th Session (May-June 1985), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. 953, 973, 1150, 1168, 1233, 1258, 1269, 1273 and 1281), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases.

The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. 1269(a) The Committee points to the principle', '366.At its February 1985 meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. 953, 973, 1016, 1150, 1168, 1233, 1258, 1269, 1273 and 1281, noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see 238th Report of the Committee, para. 21, approved by the Governing Board at its 229th Session (February-March 1985)).\n367.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May 1985, he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February 1985 meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. 0n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.\n368.In its 239th Report (May 1985), approved by the Governing Body at its 230th Session (May-June 1985), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. 953, 973, 1150, 1168, 1233, 1258, 1269, 1273 and 1281), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""\n369.In a communication received on 8 November 1985 the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.\n370.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from 12 to 16 January 1986. During the mission the Director-General\'s representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.\n371.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers\' organisations.\n372.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n373.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General\'s representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n374.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n418.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General\'s representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from 12 to 16 January 1986. The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May 1984, there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers\' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers\' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. 953, 973, 1016 and 1233(a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. 1150(a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. 1168(a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another 18 trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these 18 trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. 1258(a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested.

The Office sent a telegram to the Government on 26 April 1982 inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June 1982 the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.\n365.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n366.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.\n367.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November 1981, the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee\'s recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after 15 October 1979, when the previous Government had been deposed.\n368.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.\n369.In his communication of June 1982, before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country\'s international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.\n370.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. 844, the complainants alleged in particular that on 28 October 1977, workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government\'s communication of June 1982, the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in 1975 and 1978.\n371.As regards Case No. 973, according to a communication of the WCL dated 21 April 1981, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on 10 May 1980, in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on 3 June 1980 by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.\n372.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.\n373.In Case No. 953, the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated 18 July 1980, that in a clash with the armed forces on 24 June 1980, Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers\' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.\n374.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.\n375.In Case No. 1016, concerning the murder on 13 January 1981 of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June 1982 that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.\n376.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.\n377.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on 24 June 1980 at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,\n378.In Case No. 973, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.\n379.The Committee also notes that in Case No. 1016, the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.\n380.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.\n381.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.\n382.Lastly,', '362.Since 1976 numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).\n363.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.\n364.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May 1982.

The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.\n376.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.\n377.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on 24 June 1980 at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,\n378.In Case No. 973, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.\n379.The Committee also notes that in Case No. 1016, the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.\n380.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.\n381.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.\n382.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective']"

These legal measures should be accompanied by measures relating to factual situations, such as, in the first place, the release of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations at present in detention. Should the Government not supply, before the next meeting of the Committee in February 1989, information demonstrating a change in attitude as regards these matters and a clear desire to make progress as regards the situation of employers' and workers' organisations, as well as their leaders and members, the Committee would consider it necessary to refer the matter to the Governing Body recommending to it the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry in conformity with article 26, paragraph 3, of the Constitution.\n4.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos. 1129 and 1298) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. 1344, 1351 and 1372) by the International Organisation of Employers.\n5.Cases Nos. 1298 and 1344 were last examined by the Committee at its November 1986 meeting and Cases Nos. 1129 and 1351 in February 1987. (See respectively 246th Report, paras. 197 to 265, and 248th Report, paras. 421 to 436, approved by the Governing Body at its 234th and 235th Sessions (November 1986 and February-March 1987).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. 1372.\n6.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated 5 May 1987 (for Case No. 1129), 14 August 1987 (for Cases Nos. 1129, 1298, 1344 and 1351), 13 January 1988 (for Cases Nos. 1129 and 1298) and 3 February 1988 (for Cases Nos. 1298, 1344 and 1372).\n7.In addition, in a communication of 17 June 1987, several employers' delegates to the 73rd Session (1987) of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article 26 of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of 5, 19 and 28 January 1988.\n48.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.\n49.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.\n50.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.\n51.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.\n52.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, 236th Report, Case No. 1269 (El Salvador), para. 536.) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.\n53.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.\n54.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September 1985, the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.\n55.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these measures corresponded to the needs of agrarian reform. While realising that the persons mentioned in the IOE's complaint cannot take advantage of their position as COSEP leaders to evade the consequences of an agrarian reform policy, the Committee must nevertheless point out with concern that these measures have allegedly affected a large number of leaders of the employers' organisation in a discriminatory fashion. It expresses the hope that the persons in question will be fairly compensated for their losses as provided for by law.\n56.The Committee notes the Government's statement that there is no trace of any expulsion order against Mr. Frank Bendaa, the Vice-President of COSEP. Given the contradiction between the complainants' version of the facts and that of the Government, the Committee can only recall generally, that the expulsion of leaders of employers' or workers' organisations from their country for having been involved in activities linked to their position, is not only contrary to human rights, but also interferes in the activities of the organisations to which they belong (see, for example, 236th Report, Case No. 963 (Grenada) para. 78).\n57.The Government has not made a specific reply to the requests for information concerning the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day. It confines itself to stating that no citizen was deprived of his liberty on that occasion. The Committee notes this information but regrets that the authorities banned the celebrating of this Private Enterprise Day.\n58.The Committee notes that the newspaper La Prensa is once again circulating freely and expresses the hope that this measure will be final. It would, indeed, recall that the right of an employers' or workers' organisation to express its opinions uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals (see, for example, 217th Report, Case No. 963 (Grenada), para. 538).\n59.Lastly, as concerns the suspension of the state of emergency, the Committee refers to the considerations set out hereafter concerning the complaint lodged under article 26 of the Constitution of the ILO.\n60.The Governing Body must consider, in the present case, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry under article 26 of the Constitution. This complaint contains allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No. 87 based mainly on the 21 complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional freedoms, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise; and on the non-observance of Convention No. 98 based on the absence of free collective bargaining; and on the non-observance of Convention No. 144 based on the Government's failure to consult the COSEP.\n61.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. 87, the Committee recalls that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it has adopted conclusions which"", ""requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated 23 May 1988 which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November 1988 meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article 26 of the ILO Constitution.\n4.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua.

According to the ICFTU, hundreds of people, including many trade unionists, were murdered or disappeared following the coup d\'tat. Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed. The few trade union offices which stayed open were only able to do so because they remained extremely discreet. All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.\n162.The list of specific cases provided by the ICFTU is, according to this organization, in no way exhaustive in light of the fact that obtaining information and testimony in Haiti was extremely difficult because of the risk of jeopardizing the safety of the people concerned. These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On 20 October 1991, Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation\'s premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on 30 September 1991 and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November 1991, army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin\'s remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr Franois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation\'s headquarters have been closed.- On 5 November 1991 soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On 2 January 1992, Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on 6 January 1992 as a consequence of this torture.- On 20 March 1992, Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On 13 March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students\' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On 20 May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students\' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On 25 May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women\'s branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of 27 May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July 1992 in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists\' union, AJH. The union was dismantled through acts of harassment and intimidation committed against its leaders, and the new pro-military leaders condemned the legitimate leaders in speeches made on the radio.- The Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH) was particularly singled out by the army. Its members were harassed, threatened and dismissed. One of its members was murdered. Jean Delince Josma, a member of the FESTREDH, was reportedly murdered by the army in October. Shortly after the coup d\'tat of September, the army broke into buildings of the National Electric Company, threatening and harassing members of the FESTREDH. The director of the company, who had just been named, refused to follow the army\'s orders to dismiss the trade union leaders, and was dismissed himself. Subsequently, 23 members of the FESTREDH were dismissed in mid-December 1991. On 14 December 1991, two trade union leaders of the FESTREDH, Abel Pointdujour and Evans Saintune, were arrested when they tried to negotiate compensation for the company\'s workers who had been dismissed after the coup d\'tat. They were only released three days later, after having been interrogated about their supposed political links and been advised that they should, in the interest of their own safety, leave the country. During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum. The General Secretary went into hiding after having discovered that his name was on a list of trade union leaders and leaders of grass-roots organizations sought by the army. A jeep belonging to the trade union and used by trade union leaders to maintain contact with their members in the countryside was destroyed by the army.- In January, two other leaders of the FESTREDH were arrested and harassed by the army. Delamain Ambroise and Raynald Garnier were abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention. They were subsequently released and dismissed from their jobs. On 1 April 1992, several members of the executive and two trade union representatives, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were severely beaten by the army. From the month of September on, all the members of the executive and the FESTREDH were dismissed because of their trade union activities.- Farmers\' trade unions have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment from the military. On 5 May 1992, Jacques Joseph, the President of the CLAM, a farmers\' trade union affiliated with the OGITH, and his wife were arrested and severely beaten. They were accused of leading a demonstration calling for the return of President Aristide. They were later released.- At the beginning of May, Daniel Pierre, the President of the UDTL, a trade union of farmers in Boukan Michel which is affiliated with the OGITH, was detained by the section chief, Yvon Verdieu. Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On 5 May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers\' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to', '161.In Case No. 1682, the initial complaint of the ICFTU of 10 November 1992 concerned violations of human rights and trade union rights resulting from the military coup d\'tat of September 1991 which overthrew the democratically elected Government of Haiti. According to the ICFTU, hundreds of people, including many trade unionists, were murdered or disappeared following the coup d\'tat. Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed. The few trade union offices which stayed open were only able to do so because they remained extremely discreet. All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.\n162.The list of specific cases provided by the ICFTU is, according to this organization, in no way exhaustive in light of the fact that obtaining information and testimony in Haiti was extremely difficult because of the risk of jeopardizing the safety of the people concerned.

They were originally submitted to the ILO prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in 1985. The Government has since sent information on these cases in communications dated 21 April and 6 and 8 May 1986.\n230.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n231.The allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence committed by employers against workers, trade union activists and union leaders in the sugar cane plantations and alcohol distilleries of several States of Brazil, and specifically in Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, and to the failure of the Government to put a stop to them.\n232.In the case of the State of Pernambuco in particular, the allegations concern the banning of union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and even the assassination of union leaders or their relations simply for having demanded the implementation or renewal of collective agreements. Moreover, the complainants claim that a situation bordering on slavery and forced labour has developed in these regions, with workers being recruited clandestinely from other parts of the country to break the strikes called by the regular workers belonging to FETAPE.\n233.The complainants explained that following a general strike in 1979 the 240,000 rural workers of the sugar cane growing area secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From 1979 to 1983 other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the labour court and the workers became aware that they could take legal action to have them enforced. As from 1982, however, the employers began to sabotage the agreements by recruiting huge numbers of unemployed labour from the drought-stricken areas of Sertao and Agreste. They got rid of the regular workers and replaced them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from those areas. After the harvest, these workers returned to their home districts and had no way of demanding that their rights be respected before a labour court.\n234.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation which, after the 1982 elections, relaxed its supervision. In order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers from the Meta area, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or tripling the daily volume of work provided for in the collective agreements. They brought private militia onto the sugar plantations, armed with revolvers and rifles, to ""pay a visit"" on the inhabitants and ""supervise"" the payment of the workers. Some workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; the land was laid waste and turned into cane-fields. The employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the labour standards stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting union dues from their pay. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations and punished workers who, as union delegates, attempted to keep in touch with their union. Some whose names were communicated by CONTAG and the ICFTU received death threats, were locked up in private prisons or were even assassinated, especially in the Goias area.\n235.In the State of Sao Paulo the FTIC is unable to organise the workers of the state alcohol distilleries and is being prevented from establishing occupational associations that could subsequently become trade uninons. In Gantus , for instance, an agro-industrial enterprise with a distillery in Tupa, the employer has circulated a petition among the staff stating that the workers recognise that the enterprise is well run and rejecting the ""inopportune"" remarks of Pedro GonUales da Silva, a union leader responsible for unionisation in the State of Sao Paulo. The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.\n236.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers\' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country\'s land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic\'s solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.\n237.The Government notes that in May 1985 collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed. It encloses a copy of the agreements between the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo and the Federation of Agricultural Workers, the Sugar Industries\' Trade Union and the Alcohol Industries\' Trade Union of the State of Sao Paulo. It adds that the Ministry of Labour has decided to set up a special group to enforce the agreements and encloses a copy of the relevant Decree No. 3246 of 31 March 1985. The Decree specifies that the special group is to be tripartite and must submit its first conclusions and recommendations within 60 days of the entry into force of the collective agreements. A collective agreement was signed on 2l September l985 between the rural workers and sugar cane plantation employers in the East of Pernambuco.\n238.In addition, on 20 September 1985 the Ministry of Labour set up a special tripartite committee to examine complaints of infringements of freedom of association made against the Government of Brazil through the ILO. The committee was required to submit its conclusions to the Labour Rights Commission of the Ministry of Labour. The tripartite committee met on 21 January 1986 and concluded that the facts that had been denounced were of the utmost gravity. They concern the assassination of rural workers, death threats, acts of violence against rural workers and union leaders, the holding of persons in private prisons, the existence of private militias, the practice of torture by the federal police of Goias, attacks and other violations of human rights. The committee concluded that it could not reach any conclusion without concrete information as to whether or not steps had been taken by the competent authorities to deal with each complaint, how far the inquiries had advanced and whether the State Prosecutor\'s office had been informed. The committee therefore asked the Ministry of Labour\'s legal adviser to request the Office of the Ministry of Justice for detailed information on each case. Thereafter, on 6 March 1986, the Minister of Labour requested the Minister of Justice to investigate all the complaints submitted in Case No. 1313. As soon as it has received the necessary information on this case, the committee will be in a position to reach definitive conclusions.\n239.With respect to Case No. 1331, the regional labour delegation of the State of Sao Paulo has called for an investigation of the matter. This delegation indicated that on 26 August l985 the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries accepted that the matter was now closed. The Government attaches to its reply communication No. 24.440-13.399/85, signed on 26 August l985 by the said Federation, from which it appears that the conflict which had developed at the TUPA-SP enterprise had been resolved.\n240.The Committee observes that the complaints were submitted prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in 1985. Nevertheless, they contain extremely serious allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo and in alcohol distilleries. The allegations refer to the banning of trade union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and the assassination of union leaders.\n241.The Committee has noted the very specific information submitted by the Government', ""301.The allegations presented by complainants in these two cases werecontained in the following communications: from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated 17 June and 14 November 1988\n302.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), but it has ratified the Rightto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n303.In its initial complaint of 17 June 1988, the ICFTU explains thatworkers in the service of the State launched several protest actions at thenational level in April 1988 against Government Decree No. 2425 of 1988freezing for two months (April-May) the salaries of federal public employeesand of workers in state enterprises. In view of the Government's refusal toenter into discussions with the trade unions, the trade union organisations inthe public sector and state enterprises decided to call a 48-hour strike on 3\n304.The ICFTU goes on to say that the strike was called by 163 trade unionorganisations, representing 1 1/2 million workers, and that it paralysed fullyor partly all the sectors affected by the Decree, namely oil, metallurgy, theports, electricity, chemicals, banks, railways, mining and telephones. Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees. On 4 May the co-ordinating committee requested a meeting with theMinisters of Labour and of the Economy. The former did not open negotiationsand the latter refused to receive the workers' representatives.\n305.The Government called in the army to repress the strike and to occupythe Petrobras and Duque de Caxias oil refineries in the State of Rio deJaneiro. At the Cubatao refinery in Sao Paulo, 400 workers coming off a shiftwere forced by the army to stay and work the following shift - which meantsleeping and eating in the refinery.\n306.At EMBRAER, an aeronautics enterprise at San Jos dos Campos in theState of Sao Paulo, 242 workers were dismissed, including the works committeeand trade union leaders. The aeronautics police forced the strikers at bayonetpoint to return to work.\n307.At the Jaguariri copper mines in the State of Bahia, 68 workers,including 18 trade union leaders, eight members of the works committee and tendirectors of the Public Employees' Association were dismissed.\n308.Still in the mining sector, at Carajs in the State of Par, 17 tradeunion leaders of the local association were dismissed and expelled from theiraccommodations (which belong to the enterprise); they were warned that theywould be expelled on 26 May. Twelve workers from Puerto de Santos were alsodismissed.\n309.In a subsequent communication dated 14 November 1988, the ICFTU furtherindicates that since 7 November 1988, 2,000 workers from the MetallurgicalTrade Union of the Volta Redonda National Iron and Steel Company are on strikeand are occupying the plant to secure the recovery of the 26 per cent wagelosses of recent months, a wage readjustment of 17.68 per cent for the monthof July, the reinstatement of 70 of their colleagues who were dismissedfollowing an earlier strike, and a six-hour working day on the basis of threedaily shifts.\n310.On 9 November 1988, the ICFTU continues, the police and the army raidedthe plant at 5 p.m., using tear-gas and sub-machine guns; they killed fiveworkers and left dozens seriously injured. The trade unionists who were killedare Joao Carlos Barroso, William Fernandez Leita, Wladimir Freitas Monteiro,Victor Adriani and Vincente Silva. According to the ICFTU, the plant is stilloccupied by over 1,000 armed soldiers and surrounded by tanks.\n311.The WFTU, in its complaint of 15 November 198, denounces the events atVolta Redonda and claims that 20,000 workers are on strike and that, inaddition to the five workers who were killed (and it cites the same names asthose given by the ICFTU), 43 were injured and four persons - Mauricio Plata,Jos de Almayda, Osvaldino Gmez and Marcelino Alvez - are missing. The WFTUadds that on 11 November 1988, 700 workers from the National Iron and SteelCompany of Rio de Janeiro, together with workers from the Casa Piedra MiningCompany in the State of Minas Gerais, came out on strike in solidarity withthe workers of Volta Redonda and that five workers were injured inconfrontations with the army.\n312.The ICFTU, however, in a letter dated 5 January 1989, amends itsprevious letter stating that three, not five, workers were killed: Mr.Fernandes Filho and Mr. Freitas Monteiro who were shot, and Mr. Barroso whodied after his skull was broken by blows.\n313.The WCOTP, in its letter of 9 November 1988, denounces the violentintervention by the police (with tear-gas and cavalry charges) on 27 October\n314.In its first reply of 9 February 1989, the Government furnishes acertain amount of information and observations concerning the allegations madeby the WCOTP concerning the alleged anti-union reprisals against teachers,students and employees of the University of Sao Paulo on 27 October 1988during a demonstration in respect of pay claims. In this connection theGovernment states that the Regional Delegation for Labour of Sao Paulo, whichit consulted on the matter, had informed it that employees of the universityhad indeed organised a campaign in front of the headquarters of the Governorof the state with a view to obtaining better salaries within the framework ofthe municipal election campaign of 1988. The Government confirms that thepersons concerned held several public demonstrations but claims that none ofthese took place near the Governor's Palace or involved a dispute with thestate military police. The Government states that an investigation is beingcarried out by the competent bodies of the Government of the State of SaoPaulo to determine who was responsible.\n315.In another reply, dated 14 April 1989, concerning allegations by theICFTU in respect of anti-union reprisals against public employees and workersin state enterprises, following a 48-hour strike in support of pay claims in\n316.The Government goes on to explain that the presence of the military inthe Duque de Caxias oil refinery was designed to protect public property andavoid it being damaged and that this helped to ensure that the strike remainedpeaceful.\n317.Still according to the Government, the workers who were dismissed atPorto Santos have all been reinstated following negotiations.\n318.The Government states that the account given of the events which tookplace at the EMBRAER enterprise is inaccurate. It maintains that on 9 and 10August 1988 workers of this enterprise went on strike claiming a 30 per centwage increase with the support of the Metallurgical Trade Union which hadremained inside the plant on 9 August when the strikers occupied the works. On\n319.As regards the dismissal of the three trade union leaders, BeneditoCarlos de Sousa, Francisco Assis de Souza and Joao Pedro Pires, a judicialinquiry was opened before the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Sao Josdos Campos to determine whether there had been serious misconduct constitutingjust grounds for the dismissal of the said trade union leaders. In the courseof the appeal lodged by the dismissed leaders, the enterprise proposed anagreement, which was ratified. According to this agreement, the leaderssecured the guaranteed maintenance of their rights as though they had not beendismissed on just grounds. This agreement was approved by the regionaltribunal of the second region of Sao Paulo.\n320.Thirty-three of the 155 workers whose dismissal had been approved bythe trade union were reinstated in the enterprise.\n321.The Government concludes its statement on this allegation by specifyingthat the strike in question was judged to be illegal by the Sao Paulo LabourCourt as a result of which, at the time, the workers concerned were deemed tohave committed serious misconduct. At the same time, the Government claims, noone was dismissed on unjust grounds.\n322.The Government refutes, moreover, the allegations concerning thedismissal of 17 trade union leaders at Carajs in the State of Par.\n323.More generally, the Government specifies, as regards the pay freeze forthe months of April and May 1988 of federal public employees and of workers instate enterprises, that in fact Legislative Decree No. 2453 of 1988 providedfor a 16.19 per cent pay increase for August 1988 based on the cost of livingfor April 1988, and that Act No. 7686 of 1988 established 17.68 per cent payincreases for November 1988 based on the cost of living for May 1988.\n324.As regards the allegations made both by the ICFTU and by the WFTUconcerning the social conflict in November 1988 within the National Iron andSteel Company at Volta Redonda in the State of Rio de Janeiro, the Governmentstates, in a further communication dated 14 April 1989, that thismixed-economy company is one of the largest iron and steel works in thecountry and that it generates thousands of jobs and is a major source offoreign currency. The Government confirms that on 7 November 1988 a strikebroke out among the 20,000 workers of this enterprise, as stated by the WFTU(not 2,000 as stated by the ICFTU). The Government also confirms that thestrikers demanded pay increases and better conditions of work as well as thereinstatement of workers who had been dismissed for having participated in aprevious strike. The Government adds that the strikers occupied the steelworks, which are a vital sector of the plant housing the blast furnaces.\n325.According to the Government, the aggressiveness which marked theatmosphere from the beginning of the dispute and which resulted in a deadlockin the negotiations on the claims, together with a series of incidents inwhich the property of the iron and steel works was"", ""301.The allegations presented by complainants in these two cases werecontained in the following communications: from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated 17 June and 14 November 1988\n302.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), but it has ratified the Rightto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n303.In its initial complaint of 17 June 1988, the ICFTU explains thatworkers in the service of the State launched several protest actions at thenational level in April 1988 against Government Decree No. 2425 of 1988freezing for two months (April-May) the salaries of federal public employeesand of workers in state enterprises.

Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, and to request it once more to indicate the present position of Mr. Julio Ayala Serra;(c) to draw attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs 206 to 208 with respect to strikes in the teaching profession and the dissolution of the National Union of Educators (UNE), and to request the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE, which is not in conformity with Article 4 of Convention No. 87 (ratified by Ecuador), and supply information on any development in this connection;(d) to take note of this interim report.\n371.The complaints are contained in two communications, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated 9 July 1977, and the other from the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated 20 July 1977. The CPUSTAL supplied additional information in a letter dated 1 August 1977. The Government forwarded its observations by a communication dated 28 September 1977. On 12 October 1977 the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions submitted a complaint concerning which the Government has not yet transmitted its observations.\n372.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n373.The CPUSTAL alleged that the Police Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of non-existent laws, had pronounced judgement sentencing to two years' imprisonment, and fines of from 8,000 to 10,000 sucres, the President of the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), Juan Vasquez Bastidas, and the President of the National Union of Educators (UNE), Manuel Anton. These organisations are members of the CPUSTAL. The complainants added that these persons had not been given any sort of trial.\n374.The WFTU stated that the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL - had organised, on 18 May 1977, a 24-hour national strike in support of a claim for higher wages and other demands of an economic and social nature. The UNE, which has a membership of 60,000 teachers, called a work stoppage on the same day with a view to obtaining a salary rise and an increase in the national education budget. In response, added the WFTU, the Government issued a decree, No. 1475, conferring upon police intendants the status of special judges competent to try trade union officials and strikers under an expeditious procedure with no right of appeal. At the same time the Government instructed these police intendants to bring to trial the principal leaders of the three Confederations that had organised the national strike of 18 May, as well as officials of the UNE.\n375.Furthermore, continued the complainants, the Supreme Council of Government issued on 30 May 1977 a decree outlawing the UNE and providing for the custodianship of its funds. At the end of June, the General Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of the aforementioned Decree No. 1475, sentenced Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton to fines and imprisonment. The WFTU further mentioned the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guays who was to be tried under the same procedure.\n376.The Government, in a detailed reply to which were appended a large number of documents, emphasised that it was its policy to encourage the trade union movement in Ecuador. As evidence of this it pointed to the subsidy of 265,000 sucres that it paid to the country's trade union Confederations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, to cover the expenses of the 1 May rally. However, it continued, the leaders of these three Confederations had taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by this event - in which the majority of the participants had no connection with the trade union movement - to incite the workers to take part in a national work stoppage on 18 May 1977, based on a combat manifesto of nine points, not all of which related to industrial matters, and which were refuted one by one. Moreover, none of these demands had been put to the competent authorities through the proper legal channels.\n377.In the appendices to the Government's reply there was a list of these points and the arguments whereby the Government refuted them. These demands were as follows:\n378.The Government stated that the union leaders were allowed to prepare for the work stoppage in full freedom. They had access to the radio, television and the press at the national level. The Government further pointed out that it had recognised the workers' organisations without reservations. However, it could not fail in its moral and legal duty to preserve public order and ensure that citizens could live their lives normally in every respect. It could only condemn incitement to disorderly conduct and anarchy, whoever was responsible, and any attempt to undermine the functioning of the State by disregarding the procedures in force for dealing with all grievances, individual or collective. In substance, the Government enforced the regulations in force to defend its stability and ensure the preservation of public order and the safety of persons and property. It was these duties that the Government was performing in dealing with the events of 18 May 1977.\n379.The Government refuted the complainants' allegations completely. It claimed that these complaints were unfounded and did not mention a single specific case of infringement of the freedom of association Conventions. All persons living on the territory of a State, added the Government, were required to observe the laws of that country. Under Legislative Decree No. 105 of 7 June 1967, the instigators of a collective stoppage of work, and the ringleaders of such a stoppage, were liable to a fine of from 1,000 to 10,000 sucres and from two to five years' imprisonment. Persons who participated in such a work stoppage without having instigated it or being a ringleader were liable to a fine of from 200 to 1,000 sucres and from three months' to one year's imprisonment. A work stoppage within the meaning of this legislative decree was deemed to occur where there was a collective cessation of activity, where establishments were forcibly closed other than in the circumstances provided for by law, and in the event of paralysis of channels of communication or other anti social acts. These provisions had the force of a special Act and had precedence over those of general Acts which were contrary to them.\n380.The strike of 18 May 1977, continued the Government, had been prepared, inter alia, by Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Emilio Velasco and Jos Chvez Chvez, officials of one or other of the workers' associations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, while other unions (bearing the same initials) had refused to be associated with the stoppage and had condemned it as an act of treason by the rank and file, requesting the support of the authorities to enable them to carry on with their daily work. The above-mentioned persons, in instigating the strike, had contravened Legislative Decree No 105.\n381.This Legislative Decree, added the Government, was supplemented by Presidential Decree No. 1475, which specified the competent judicial authority and guarantees the rights of defendants. There accordingly existed a judicial institution, established by the State, to mete out punishment in the case of work stoppages and strikes organised unlawfully. The Government appended the text of this decree, adopted on 25 May 1977. Section 1 confers upon general police intendants the status of special judges competent to deal with and pronounce judgement upon offences in connection with collective work stoppages; they must impose the penalties prescribed in Legislative Decree No. 105. Section 2 states that the procedure is to be that prescribed in section 454 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; sections 455, 456, 459 and 460 of that Code are likewise to be observed. Section 3 specifies that special judges may, either on their own initiative or at the request of any administrative or judicial authority, take up a case and try the persons held to be criminally responsible for a collective work stoppage.\n382.The judgements handed down in respect of Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, concluded the Government, had been pronounced in accordance with the legal rules in force in the country and the penalties had been imposed by the legally competent authority. There could, therefore, be no question as to the validity of their conviction.\n383.This case is mainly concerned with the general strike called on 18 May 1977 by the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL and another strike organised on the same day by the UNE. This work stoppage resulted in the sentencing, under an emergency procedure, of trade union leaders including Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton. The complainants also mention the arrest of another trade union leader, Julio Ayala Serra, and the outlawing of the UNE, but the Government has made no observations on the latter two points.\n384.As already pointed out by the Committee, Article 3 of Convention No. 87 recognises the right of trade union organisations"", '189.The Committee on Freedom of Association examined this case at its November 1987 meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see 253rd Report, paragraphs 343 to 356), which was approved at its 238th Session (November 1987).\n190.The Government sent additional information on the outstanding allegations in a communication dated 17 December 1987.\n191.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n197.The Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government concerning this case, in particular that Julio Chang Crespo, the trade union officer who is the subject of this complaint, and other trade unionists have been released after serving a sentence of two days\' imprisonment handed down by the trial judge for disseminating false information and rumours concerning the order currently prevailing in Ecuadorian society and for offending national honour. The sentence accords with the provisions of section 606(13) of the Ecuadorian Penal Code.\n198.The Committee would nevertheless recall the principle that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas and to this end workers, employers and their organisations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. However, the Committee recalls in general terms that in expressing their opinions trade union organisations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language. (See 217th Report, Case No. 963 (Grenada), para. 538 and 244th Report, Case No. 1309 (Chile), para. 336(f).)\n199.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee notes that Julio Chang Crespo and the other trade unionists who are the subject of this complaint have been released after being sentenced to two days\' imprisonment. The Committee further considers that the matter does not call for further examination.\n343.In a communication dated 25 March 1987, the ICFTU submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Ecuador.\n344.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated 15 July 1987.\n345.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n346.In its communication dated 25 March 1987, the ICFTU explains that its affiliate organisation in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL), together with other national trade union confederations, called a national strike on 25 March 1987 to protest against the excessive increase in fuel prices and transport costs. According to the ICFTU, the Government, on the grounds of this national strike, ordered the arrest of the Secretary-General of the CEOSL, Julio Chang and other trade unionists.\n347.In its communication of 15 July 1987, the Government points out that on 5 and 6 March 1987, there were three serious earthquakes which affected a large part of the country, resulting in loss of life and property and bringing oil production (the country\'s major trade export) to a halt, as a large stretch of the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline was destroyed; this caused a sudden situation in which the national economy threatened to collapse. The Government, the communication continues, coped with the emergency situation as best it could to ensure that the country could continue functioning in spite of the immediate consequences of the disaster.\n348.The Government adds that, in view of the disasterous situation which had occurred and which threatened to paralyse the national economy, it was bound, in fulfilling its obligations to govern, to take some measures to create emergency resources (so to be able to pay the salaries of public servants, amongst other things) and improve the capacity of the remaining system of production. As part of these measures, it was necessary to raise the price of petrol to the equivalent of 46 American cents or 75 Swiss centimes per gallon (4 litres), i.e. 11 American cents or 18 Swiss centimes per litre. Furthermore, it was vital to release foreign currency and float the bank interest rate, because the State was incapable of continuing to subsidise exchange rates and the fixed interest rate.\n349.The Government\'s communication adds that confronted with this situation, the ""executive"" of the trade union confederations did not adopt a responsible attitude. Mr. Fausto Dutn, substitute member of the National Congress, representing the Broad Left Front (FADI), took over the presidency of the Workers\' Unitarian Front (FUT) and announced the list of claims of the forthcoming strike which advocated: i)there should be no payment of the foreign debt; (ii) the oil industry should be nationalised; (iii) primary commodities should only be marketed by ENAC and ENPROVIT (state marketing enterprises) in order to maintain a price balance; (iv) land should be handed over to the peasants. Furthermore, it demanded that the Head of State should be put on trial and resign and that the decision to increase fuel prices should be revoked.\n350.The Government points out that this case has nothing to do with a ""strike"", because in Ecuadorian labour law a strike means ""a collective suspension of work by employees acting in combination""; a strike is authorised ""if a dispute arises between an employer and his employees"", and this is submitted to the conciliation and arbitration tribunal. It may only be declared in the following cases: ""(1) if the employer, after being notified of the employees\' demands, fails to reply within the statutory time or gives a negative reply; (2) if the employer, after being notified, dismisses or gives notice of dismissal to one or more employees, or gives notice of the termination of an agreement ..."", except ""in the case of the dismissal of an employee who has committed an act of violence against the property of the undertaking or factory or against the person of the employer or his agent; (3) if no conciliation and arbitration tribunal is appointed within the time specified in section 466 or if, having been appointed, the tribunal for any reason does not meet within three days of its appointment, on condition in either case that the failure is not the fault of the members designated by the employees; (4) if conciliation proves impossible or no award is issued within the time allowed by section 473"". Strikes are only guaranteed by the Constitution and the Labour Code subject to these conditions. However, this concept of strike action is so wide that it authorises strikers to remain in the factories, workshops or workplaces concerned (unique in world labour legislation), under police protection against the entry of agitators and strike breakers; it entitles strikers to receive remuneration and authorises solidarity strikes: ""The law also recognises the right to strike where the object is to support a lawful strike declared by the employees of another undertaking."" A lawful general strike might arise because employees in one undertaking support a strike in another undertaking, which is being conducted in accordance with the law, and this spreads to all undertakings throughout the country.\n351.But this is not the case here, the Government continues in its communication, because on 25 March 1987 political leaders of various opposition parties illegally interpreted ""freedom of association"" in their own way. These same political leaders head trade union confederations grouped together in the Workers\' Unitarian Front, whilst also participating in the Ecuadorian Revolutionary Youth Movement, the Workers\' Revolutionary Movement, the General Union of Workers or the Popular Front. Similarly, they collaborate with these real or fictitious organisations, with the FEUE and the UNE and various clandestine groups who are openly committed to violence. These persons, in interpreting freedom of association in their own way, prevented the free movement of vehicles and pedestrians and normal activities within the city by raising obstacles and barricades in the streets, destroying traffic signs, public clocks and rubbish bins and tearing up the paving on the streets.\n352.The Government\'s communication also describes the outcome of the above-mentioned strike; in particular, it notes that: citizens and members of the police and their vehicles were stoned; tyres were burnt, in Esmeralda, stores and private houses were stormed and several establishments burnt; in Quito, as a result of the storming of the Hotel Coln Internacional and the Finance Corporation with incendiary bombs, there was a threat of fire in the first floors of the hotel and the windows of both buildings were shattered; the premises of the Employers\' and Workers\' Association of the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources were attacked with incendiary bombs; and in Quito, an incendiary bomb was thrown at a van transporting a group of young conscripts doing their national military service, some of whom suffered injuries and burns. In the capital city, the strikers killed hundreds of dogs, scorching them in the fire and then hanging them from the branches of trees and on lamp-posts. At the end of the day of 25 March, the strikers declared that the ""tenth general strike"" organised by the FUT had been ""victorious"". Several FUT officials tried,', ""E.P. PETROECUADOR, have forfeited their legal personality by failing to renew their statutes when their employer became defunct, in accordance with the second transitory provision of Decree No. 315. The Government states that, in the light of these facts, FETRAPEC is not currently a representative organization, nor does it have legal personality.\n269.As to recommendation (b), the Government states that the employment relationship of public officials who are subject to the regulations laid down in the Labour Code may be terminated by means of unfair dismissal, which is provided for in and regulated by section 188 of the Labour Code, which applies to workers in both the public and private sectors without distinction. Trade union members and officials do not fall under a special category of workers who enjoy privileges that other workers do not, just as unfair dismissal is not used to harm members of trade union movements. The Government states that, in Ecuador, a dismissal is only illegal when the worker is not compensated in accordance with the law, for which reason, no enterprise that has fulfilled the obligations set out in section 188 of the Labour Code is obliged to reinstate dismissed workers.\n270.As to recommendation (c), the Government states that all the dismissed workers, of whom only a tiny percentage were trade union officials, were duly compensated in accordance with section 188 of the Labour Code. The Government reaffirms that none of the dismissals was anti-union in nature, as the Labour Code applies to all workers without distinction, and that trade union members and officials do not enjoy privileges that other workers do not, just as unfair dismissal is not used to harm members of trade union movements. Ecuadorian legislation does not consider the unilateral termination of an employment relationship to be illegal, provided that the worker is duly compensated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the current Government has approved three times more trade union organizations than other governments and that the proposed new Labour Code, which has been developed with the technical assistance of the ILO, guarantees the right to freedom of association by branch without interference from employers. These facts demonstrate the current Government s wholehearted support for the trade union movement in Ecuador.\n271.As to recommendation (d) on the alleged violation of the collective agreement in force regarding compensation owed to workers who voluntarily ended their employment at the aforementioned enterprise, the Government states that the ruling of the National Court establishes that the workers who elected to end their employment voluntarily freely accepted their dismissal and signed the relevant severance agreement, thereby accepting the severance pay provided for therein. The Government indicates that, in the light of these facts, promoting dialogue between the enterprise and the workers as an alternative administrative measure to resolve the conflict is no longer necessary, given that the ruling of the national court has resolved the conflict through the judicial system, which has followed the correct procedure in accordance with the Constitution and the law.\n272.As to recommendation (e) on the alleged dismissals at the Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil enterprise and the ongoing criminal proceedings against the workers, the Government indicates that under Decree No. 1786, issued by the President of the Republic and published in Official Journal No. 625 of 2 August 2009, the then Board of the Temporary Electrical Power Administration of Guayaquil became the Unit for the Generation, Distribution and Commercialization of Electrical Energy of Guayaquil (Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil), which, according to article 1 of the aforementioned Decree, comes under the authority of the Executive, which is part of the central public administration. In the light of these facts and with regard to the alleged dismissals, the Government states that, on the morning of Wednesday 18 November 2009, the aforementioned Unidad Elctrica de Guayaquil workers arbitrarily stopped work for no legitimate reason and began shouting slogans against the authorities of the enterprise. According to the Government, it became clear from the numerous press articles on the incident that the workers had even resorted to the unauthorized use of automobiles to block the entrances to the enterprise s premises in order to carry out the stoppage. It should be noted that those automobiles are public property and should only be used for work purposes. The Government states that, in this way, the workers endangered the safety and physical integrity of all the persons present at that time by committing acts that are expressly prohibited by section 46, paragraphs (a) and (b), of the Labour Code. In the light of these facts and as is reflected in the documentation in the possession of the Guayaquil Department of the Ministry of Labour Relations, the dismissals were approved in accordance with the third reason listed in section 172 of the Labour Code, which led the labour inspector, who was acting on behalf of the administrative authority and using the powers conferred on him by section 545, paragraph 5, of the Labour Code, to approve the dismissal of the workers in question.\n273.As to recommendation (f), the Government indicates that Ministerial Order No. 00080, published in Official Journal No. 394 of 1 August 2008, was issued with the aim of automatically adjusting the clauses of the collective agreements in question to ensure their compliance with the provisions of Constituent Resolution No. 008. The aforementioned ministerial order is understood as being an instrument for regulating the transition from the former collective agreements in place prior to Constituent Resolution No. 008 to ensure their compliance with its provisions. Therefore, the ministerial order has served its purpose, is final and complies with Ecuadorian legislation without violating the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. 98 for the reasons detailed below. Ecuador respects the principles enshrined in Convention No. 98 and has on no occasion prohibited free collective bargaining, rather it has regularized such bargaining so that it takes place within the framework of established parameters, which are in keeping with the limitations of the State of Ecuador, its fiscal budget and its constitutional principles, such as those established in article 286 of the Constitution, which provides that:  At all levels of Government, public funds shall be managed in a sustainable, responsible and transparent manner and shall seek to achieve economic stability. Permanent expenditure shall be funded with permanent sources of income. Permanent expenditure on health care, education and the judicial system shall take priority and, in exceptional circumstances, shall be funded with non-permanent sources of income'  In this connection, the Government also refers to Ministerial Order No. 00155A, which was published in Official Journal No. 455 of 14 October 2008 and lays down the regulations for revising collective labour agreements, in accordance with the provisions of Constituent Resolution No. 008, but which does not prevent free collective bargaining, provided that it takes place within the established parameters and is in keeping with the principle enshrined in article 286 of the Constitution and the principles of equality and transparency. Ministerial Order No. 00155A also seeks to ensure equal pay for equal work in the public sector by respecting differences but not excesses and privileges, which cannot be sustained by the budget of the State of Ecuador and which undermine the principle of equity. Thus, Ministerial Order No. 00155A is also final and complies with Ecuadorian legislation.\n274.As to the Committee s request for the Government to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No. 008 is compatible with an exclusively judicial control, the Government states that the fourth transitory provision of Constituent Resolution No. 008 provides that the Executive that shall be responsible for establishing the criteria that shall govern the collective labour agreements of all public sector institutions, and that the third transitory provision of the regulations governing the application of Constituent Resolution No. 008 provides that the Ministry of Labour shall lay down the regulations and procedures for revising the aforementioned collective labour agreements and that  judges, courts and the administrative authorities shall enforce this provision' \n275.The Committee recalls that the allegations that were still pending in this case related to union dues being returned to the workers who are members of FETRAPEC; to the adoption of legislation that was contrary to trade union independence and the right to bargain collectively; and to the dismissal of trade unionists [see 367th Report, para. 745].\n276.As to the recommendation requesting the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the trade union dues are immediately returned to the workers who are members of FETRAPEC, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that the Ministry of Labour Relations has taken note of the recommendation and undertakes to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the union dues are returned to the members of FETRAPEC, and to inform the Committee of the progress made towards that end. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in that regard.\n277.As to the recommendation requesting the Government to encourage without delay the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the""]"

Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government assumed power on 1 March 1985 to halt the deterioration in the trade union situation in Uruguay and restore democracy. The Committee intends to examine all these cases, which relate to a trade union situation that arose under the regime that came to power as a result of the military takeover in 1973, in a single document.\n86.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n87.In its letter of 26 August 1985, the Government states that the process of institutionalising democracy, and therefore of remedying the trade union situation, began on 1 March 1985. It recalls that it sent a representative to the May 1985 meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments. The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before the Committee.\n94.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.\n95.The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the interested parties; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.\n96.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life of the country.(b) The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union situation.\n206.When the Committee examined these cases at its November 1984 meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations which were pending:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Cases Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt, in respect of whom it wished to be kept informed of any action taken) and that it has also expressed the hope that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of 34 trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused (Milton Morales - in detention, David Calleros, Jess Eguren, Jaime Lpez, Mara Martnez , Carlos Mechoso, Roberto Meirelles, Dimar Silva - all undergoing trial; Jorge Alvarez, Rubn Bello, Diego Brugnole, Jaime Bugarn, Julio Durante, Jos Glisenti, Carlos Goerrero, Miguel Guzmn, Yolanda Ibarra, Luis Iguini, Ral Larraya, Wilman Lasena, Francisco Laurenzo, Waldamar de Len, Len Lev, Miguel Longo, Francisco Maiorana, Guillermo Martiello, Leandro Moreira, Rogelio Ortiz, Norberto Quintana, Ramn R. Reyes, Toms Rivero, Washington Rodrguez Belleti, Hugo Rossi and Edgardo Torres - all sentenced), the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial and that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and constitute offences under ordinary law. However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for engaging in activities of a trade union character. It also requests that the Government supply information on this matter.\n207.In its communications of 12 and 26 March 1985 the Government states that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti is in hiding and that all the other persons mentioned by the complainants, with the exception of Rubn Bello and Len Lev (the latter of whom was sentenced for forgery) have been freed, some of them in application of the law of amnesty for political offences.\n208.In connection with the allegations which remained pending, the Committee notes with satisfaction the release of 41 of the 44 trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences. As regards the remaining three persons who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) are serving prison sentences (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.\n209.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that 41 of the 44 trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced have now been released, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences.(b) As regards the three remaining persons, who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) have been sentenced to imprisonment (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.\n359.The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release to the ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and has also expressed its hope that the request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.\n360.With reference to the list of 34 trade unionists who were detained, tried or sentenced and in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused, the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial, and has indicated that the activities of which they were accused were undertaken for the benefit of the Communist Party. The Committee observes that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and that they constitute offences under ordinary law (possession of weapons, forging of documents, use of false identity documents, attacks with rocket launchers, attacks on commercial premises, etc.). However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities regardless of whether they were calculated to favour the objectives of the Communist Party. This would seem to be the case, for example, with the collection of monetary contributions and the printing and distribution of leaflets. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for having engaged in activities of a trade union character. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on this matter.\n361.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and that it has also expressed the hope"", '118.The last time the Committee considered these cases was at its meeting in November 1975, when it submitted a report on them (153rd Report, paragraphs 157 to 253). This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its 198th Session in November 1975.\n119.After analysing the information available to it through the direct contacts procedure used in these cases, the Committee took the view that, in view of the nature of the case it would be appropriate and desirable for it to continue to follow developments in the trade union situation in Uruguay, and the effect given to its own recommendations, in accordance with the procedure in force. It accordingly recommended the Governing Body to invite the Government to submit full information before the Governing Body\'s Session in February 1976 with regard to the action already taken or contemplated with a view to complying with the Committee\'s recommendations, and to forward its observations on the questions and allegations still outstanding.\n120.The Government sent two communications dated 27 January 1976 in answer to this request, and in response to new complaints made by various complainant organisations.\n121.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n161.In view of all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that, in spite of the statement made by the Minister of Labour in June 1975, the Government has still taken no practical steps to restore the trade union situation to normal, so that the workers\' occupational organisations and their members can benefit properly from the safeguards and fully exercise the rights set forth in the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(b) to reaffirm the principle contained in Article 4 of Convention No. 87, namely that ""workers\' and employers\' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority"";(c) while noting the release of several workers and trade unionists previously detained, to draw the Government\'s attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph 158 above and, in particular, to the danger involved for trade union rights when trade unionists are arrested and no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(d) to take note of the information supplied by the Government about certain of the trade unionists detained, and to request the Government for the information still outstanding, and especially for the decisions taken with regard to the persons concerned, together with copies of the judgments rendered, with the reasons adduced;(e) to take note of the Government\'s statement concerning the allegations of ill-treatment, to reaffirm the importance of issuing specific instructions on the subject for the primary purpose of preventing any possible practices of this kind, and to request the Government for the information mentioned in paragraph 160 above;(f) to ask the Government for its detailed comments on the occupation and searching of trade union premises, referred to in paragraph 143 above;(g) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the information requested.\n157.The Committee on Freedom of Association has been examining various complaints alleging breaches of trade union rights in Uruguay, presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Confederation of Labour, the Uruguayan National Workers\' Convention, the Latin American Workers\' Confederation, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Public Services and Allied Occupations, the Trades Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries, the World Federation of Teachers\' Unions, the Latin American Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the International Federation of Actors, the Uruguayan Medical Trade Union and the Montevideo Bus Company. Almost all these complaints are combined in Case No. 763, regarding which the Committee has submitted four interim reports to the Governing Body which appear in paragraphs 532 to 552 of its 139th Report, paragraphs 191 to 221 of its 142nd Report, paragraphs 305 to 348 of its 147th Report and paragraphs 147 to 183 of its 149th Report. These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its meetings of November 1973, February-March 1974, November 1974 and March 1975, respectively.\n158.In the latter of these reports, the Committee pointed out that it was confronted with a situation which raises important problems in relation to various basic principles of freedom of association and which seems to affect a large section of the trade union movement in Uruguay. The Committee also noted that new complaints were still being presented regarding the trade union situation in Uruguay and that the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government was largely contradictory. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government\'s agreement, in accordance with the procedure for direct contacts previously adopted by the Committee in another country, for the appointment by the Director-General of a representative to examine, in Uruguay, the facts relating to the complaint and to report thereon to the Committee. This recommendation having been adopted by the Governing Body, the Uruguayan Government gave its consent in communications dated 9 and 15 May 1975.\n159.The Director-General appointed Mr. Philippe Cahier, Professor in the Institut universitaire de hautes tudes internationales in Geneva, who carried out his mission from 20 June to 1 July 1975, accompanied by an official of the International Labour Office.\n160.The Committee studied the report presented by the Director-General\'s representative and noted, in particular, that he had received all the facilities necessary for the fulfilment of his mission in Uruguay and that he had been able to have many talks, especially with the authorities and with leaders of workers\' and employers\' organisations, including detained leaders. Before visiting the country, the Director-General\'s representative had interviews with Uruguayan governmental, employers\' and workers\' delegates attending the 60th Session of the International Labour Conference and with leaders of the National Workers\' Convention living outside Uruguay.\n161.The Committee has examined the various complaints in the light of the report mentioned and wishes to state that the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative has been a valuable help in its work.\n162.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n253.Under these conditions, and with respect to the case as a whole, the Committee presents the following recommendations to the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to restrictions on freedom of association, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which should be attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. 87, taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in respect of Decree No. 622, governing trade union activities;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the dissolution of the National Workers\' Convention, the Single National Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Trades and the Federation of Secondary School Teachers, to point out to the Government that, in dissolving these organisations by decree or resolution, it failed to observe the provisions of Article 4 of Convention No. 87, which has been ratified by Uruguay, and to stress the importance which it attaches to the respect of this standard;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or orders for arrest of trade union leaders and militants,(i) to note the release of the arrested trade unionists, mentioned in paragraph 198;(ii) regarding Enrique Pastorino and Jos d\'Elia, in view of the time which has elapsed since the events which gave rise to the warrants for arrest issued against them and taking into account the fact that the other CNT leaders who were arrested in application of the same provision have all been released, to request the Government to consider the possibility of cancelling this measure, and thus helping to solve the existing problems regarding freedom of association;(iii) as regards Mr. Vladimir Turiansky, to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning his situation in law and the measures taken in this connection.(iv) with regard to the trade unionists still under arrest or awaiting trial by military courts:- to reiterate the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are accused of offences of a political nature or under common law which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union functions or activities, the persons concerned should be tried as rapidly as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority;- to request the Government to notify it of the decision taken, or transmit the text of the judgments in respect of the trade unionists mentioned above in paragraph 207, indicating the grounds adduced therefor;- to request the Government to send information on the position of the trade unionists', '118.The last time the Committee considered these cases was at its meeting in November 1975, when it submitted a report on them (153rd Report, paragraphs 157 to 253).

Almost all these complaints are combined in Case No. 763, regarding which the Committee has submitted four interim reports to the Governing Body which appear in paragraphs 532 to 552 of its 139th Report, paragraphs 191 to 221 of its 142nd Report, paragraphs 305 to 348 of its 147th Report and paragraphs 147 to 183 of its 149th Report. These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its meetings of November 1973, February-March 1974, November 1974 and March 1975, respectively.\n158.In the latter of these reports, the Committee pointed out that it was confronted with a situation which raises important problems in relation to various basic principles of freedom of association and which seems to affect a large section of the trade union movement in Uruguay. The Committee also noted that new complaints were still being presented regarding the trade union situation in Uruguay and that the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government was largely contradictory. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government\'s agreement, in accordance with the procedure for direct contacts previously adopted by the Committee in another country, for the appointment by the Director-General of a representative to examine, in Uruguay, the facts relating to the complaint and to report thereon to the Committee. This recommendation having been adopted by the Governing Body, the Uruguayan Government gave its consent in communications dated 9 and 15 May 1975.\n159.The Director-General appointed Mr. Philippe Cahier, Professor in the Institut universitaire de hautes tudes internationales in Geneva, who carried out his mission from 20 June to 1 July 1975, accompanied by an official of the International Labour Office.\n160.The Committee studied the report presented by the Director-General\'s representative and noted, in particular, that he had received all the facilities necessary for the fulfilment of his mission in Uruguay and that he had been able to have many talks, especially with the authorities and with leaders of workers\' and employers\' organisations, including detained leaders. Before visiting the country, the Director-General\'s representative had interviews with Uruguayan governmental, employers\' and workers\' delegates attending the 60th Session of the International Labour Conference and with leaders of the National Workers\' Convention living outside Uruguay.\n161.The Committee has examined the various complaints in the light of the report mentioned and wishes to state that the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative has been a valuable help in its work.\n162.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n253.Under these conditions, and with respect to the case as a whole, the Committee presents the following recommendations to the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to restrictions on freedom of association, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which should be attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. 87, taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in respect of Decree No. 622, governing trade union activities;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the dissolution of the National Workers\' Convention, the Single National Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Trades and the Federation of Secondary School Teachers, to point out to the Government that, in dissolving these organisations by decree or resolution, it failed to observe the provisions of Article 4 of Convention No. 87, which has been ratified by Uruguay, and to stress the importance which it attaches to the respect of this standard;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or orders for arrest of trade union leaders and militants,(i) to note the release of the arrested trade unionists, mentioned in paragraph 198;(ii) regarding Enrique Pastorino and Jos d\'Elia, in view of the time which has elapsed since the events which gave rise to the warrants for arrest issued against them and taking into account the fact that the other CNT leaders who were arrested in application of the same provision have all been released, to request the Government to consider the possibility of cancelling this measure, and thus helping to solve the existing problems regarding freedom of association;(iii) as regards Mr. Vladimir Turiansky, to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning his situation in law and the measures taken in this connection.(iv) with regard to the trade unionists still under arrest or awaiting trial by military courts:- to reiterate the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are accused of offences of a political nature or under common law which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union functions or activities, the persons concerned should be tried as rapidly as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority;- to request the Government to notify it of the decision taken, or transmit the text of the judgments in respect of the trade unionists mentioned above in paragraph 207, indicating the grounds adduced therefor;- to request the Government to send information on the position of the trade unionists']"

On that occasion, the Committee indicated that it would proceed with the examination of this case in relation to the specific allegations of violations of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining arising from protection agreements and to the issues concerning anti-union discrimination. The Committee requested the Government to provide all supplementary and relevant up-to-date information on the various allegations made by IndustriALL of specific situations involving the use of protection agreements, so that the Committee would have access to all relevant information when it next examined the follow-up of the case. In addition, the Committee referred the legislative aspects of the case on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n27.In its communication of 1 February 2018, the Government sent information regarding the follow-up given to the Committee s recommendations in relation to the specific situations raised by IndustriALL in its previous communications:(a)\tHonda Mexico United Workers' Union (STUHM): the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JFCA) heard the case related to the title to the collective agreement filed by the STUHM, carrying out in due time and form each step of the procedure established in legislation: (i) the vote recount was conducted on 15 October 2015 in the best possible conditions, without any duly substantiated or validated objections and in the presence of three JFCA certifying officers, the Secretary-General for Agreements, Conciliation and Collective Issues, two federal labour inspectors, eight observers representing foreign trade unions, the secretaries general and representatives of the unions and representatives of the company; (ii) the recount was carried out in accordance with the law in a peaceful and orderly manner, and of the 1,829 workers present, 788 voted for STUHM and 1,001 for the defendant trade union; (iii) when it discovered that the recount was not in its favour, the STUHM filed direct amparo proceedings with the first district labour court of the federal district, which were dismissed, confirming that the JFCA had acted in strict compliance with the law; and (iv) regarding the alleged existence of a presumed conflict of interest on the part of the individual who acted as coordinator for the advisers to the President of the JFCA, the board advised on 25 May 2016 that the individual in question did not perform that public function and there was therefore no conflict of interest.(b)\tCommercial, Office, Retail, Similar and Allied Workers' Union (STRACC): (i) on 28 March 2017, STRACC was granted the title to the collective agreement; and (ii) the parties who had been sued by STRACC lodged appeals for amparo (Nos DT 661/2017, DT 660/2017 and DT 659/2017), which were unsuccessful and therefore did not adversely affect the STRACC.(c)\tNational Union of Petroleum Technicians and Professionals (UNTyPP): (i) since 25 March 2010, Petrleos Mexicanos (PEMEX, hereinafter the oil company) and the UNTyPP have held more than 15 meetings in which issues raised by the UNTyPP have been addressed, including the dismissal of workers ' agreeing to discuss the possibility of rehiring those worker members of the UNTyPP who were affected by the aforementioned movements; (ii) this case was analysed as part of the round table discussions held since 2012 by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STPS) with the National Union of Workers ' the STPS has facilitated meetings between the UNTyPP and the management of the company in which employment files were analysed, leading to the reinstatement and retirement of several UNTyPP members, in the interest of mediating a settlement to the disputes, on 7 July 2015 the Deputy Minister for Labour addressed a communication to the chief executive officer of the company voicing the UNTyPP s concerns regarding the new collective labour agreement; (iii) there is a collective labour agreement between the company and the Petroleum Workers Union of Mexico (STPRM), which was last revised on 17 July 2017 and is valid until 31 July 2019.(d)\tWith regard to the BMW plant (hereinafter the first car manufacturer) located in San Luis Potos: (i) on 3 July 2014, a collective labour agreement was presented to the JFCA between the company and the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and the Allied Workers' Union of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM); (ii) the labour authority verified the legitimacy of the Union to assemble automotive industry workers and that the contractual agreement complied with the requirements set out in section 391 of the Federal Labour Act, the collective labour agreement was consequently registered; and (iii) on 27 November 2017, under the protocol on free collective bargaining, an extraordinary inspection was carried out at the company s San Luis Potos plant during which it was found that 815 workers (603 men and 212 women) worked in the workplace, those workers knew the representative of the union of which they were a member, were aware of the collective labour agreement that applied to them and had access to it (both in the workplace and online); in that respect, it was confirmed that the company had hard copies of the collective agreement governing labour relations that were provided to workers and were made available in freely accessible spaces.(e)\tWith regard to the KIA Motors Corporation plant (hereinafter the second car manufacturer) in Nuevo Len: (i) on 26 August 2014, a collective labour agreement was presented to the JFCA between the company and the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and Allied Workers' Union; (ii) the labour authority verified the legitimacy of the Union to assemble automotive industry workers and that the contractual agreement complied with the requirements set out in section 391 of the Federal Labour Act, and, having fulfilled the jurisdiction and legal requirements and those for the right to represent others, the agreement was registered; and (iii) on 16 November 2017, under the protocol on free collective bargaining, an extraordinary inspection was carried out of the general working conditions in the company, which verified the existence of 2,404 workers (1,720 men and 684 women), registered with the Mexican Social Security Institute, the existence of a collective labour agreement duly registered with the labour authority, and it was confirmed that the workers knew the name of the union of which they were members and the content of the collective labour agreement applicable to them and had access to it (copies were distributed to workers and kept available in freely accessible spaces).\n28.Based on the information above, the Government considers that these cases prove that state institutions function adequately and give due attention to the claims of the unions concerned. Furthermore, it recalls that new efforts have been undertaken to make the work of the labour authorities more efficient and timely and to consolidate the prompt and unimpeded administration of labour justice, including through national coordination mechanisms to improve the pursuit and administration of day-to-day justice in Mexico and the recent update to the labour regulations framework by means of the 2017 constitutional reform on labour justice administration.\n29.In communications dated 3 and 30 July 2018, IndustriALL provides its observations and further information regarding the follow-up of the case. IndustriALL reports that, despite the reforms and other measures announced by the Government, the practice of employer protection agreements is continuing and expanding, as evidenced by the specific situations it presents in relation to the complaint. As a reminder, IndustriALL condemns the system under which such protection agreements reportedly continue to operate, emphasizing that: (i) the agreements are a clear result of cooperation between the Government (which would approve employer protection agreements in return for political favours ' while acting as employer, judge and litigant in the authorities responsible for administering justice), corporate federations (which are deeply embedded in political and economic decision making bodies) and certain companies (which maintain lower operating costs and control over their workforce as these agreements protect the employer from having to negotiate with genuine unions), thus preventing workers from exercising their right to freedom of association; (ii) the protection union that will administer the collective agreement is selected before the employer even begins operations; and (iii) if workers try to organize themselves, the authorities, employers and corporate federations work together to ensure they are not successful, using methods which range from postponing proceedings to dismissals and all types of threats and assaults. In addition, it challenges the effectiveness and authenticity of the measures announced by the Government to combat this deep-rooted practice, alleging that these changes are designed to allow the situation to remain unchanged, emphasizing that: (i) union information and collective agreements are not published or available, as reported by the Government; (ii) proceedings continue to last for an average of five years; (iii) meetings with Mexican unions in relation to the complaint did not address the issue of protection unions; (iv) while the constitutional reform is presented as a panacea, in reality it is an illusion, as demonstrated by the bill formulated"", ""Bargaining Matters, Ms Guadalupe Esther Guerrero Lpez.\n640.The Government adds that on 31 October 2011, as stated, the ballot began in the JLCADF facilities, with its authorities and representatives of the Federal District Human Rights Commission (CDHDF) as observers to witness the proceedings.\n641.While proceedings were under way, with the parties present, and those in charge preparing to receive the workers so that voting could take place, there were confrontations and provocations between the supporters of both unions, resulting in violence, which forced the President of the JLCADF to suspend the ballot due to a lack of guarantees in the process. For further reference, the JLCADF submitted as evidence two CDs with photographic evidence and a video recording of the events, provided by the CDHDF.\n642.On 3 November 2011, the date was once again set for the ballot that had been suspended on 31 October 2011, which took place on 9 November 2011 at 4 p.m., with the intervention of the legal representatives of the STRM, Atento Servicios SA de CV and the SPTCTRM. To ensure continued due diligence in the ballot process, about which objections had already been made, only votes from workers were accepted.\n643.It should be noted that the labour authority had no knowledge of how the company or the unions transported their workers, as it is a procedural requirement of the parties proposing the ballot.\n644.In the aforementioned ballot, 579 workers came to cast their vote, of which only 47 voted for the STRM. Thus, the voting results, once again, went against it, making it clear that it did not represent the majority of the workers in Atento Servicios SA de CV, given that it was the workers themselves who decided that it did not represent them. This process was carried out in accordance with national labour legislation.\n645.Lastly, it is untrue that the JLCADF has refused to resolve the question of bargaining rights under the collective agreement because on 6 December 2011 it issued the corresponding award. The award had not been decided in August, which was not the fault of the JLCADF, but due to the various challenges made by the STRM, as a legally protected right to defend its interests and refer to other courts to contest the award not issued in its favour.\n646.The Government concludes by stating that: (a) national labour legislation sets out the penalties to be imposed on any employer or employers' organization that infringes the individual and/or collective rights of the workers with whom they have an employment relationship. However, it should be noted that, after analysing the complaint lodged by the STRM, it is clear that there is not sufficient information to determine whether there is any violation of and non-compliance with the legal framework, or that there has been any interference or omission by the Mexican State that might have affected any right of the workers in Atento Servicios SA de CV, as the complainant presents no evidence of allegations, actions, lawsuits and infringements to support such claim. Consequently, it reiterates that Mexican labour legislation ensures that all workers have the legal resources and means at their disposal to approach the authorities to defend their labour rights; that there are bodies such as PROFEDET, which provide guidance and free legal advice for the protection of workers' individual and collective rights; and that it is vital for workers to report any acts by employers that affect their labour rights to the appropriate authorities, so that the relevant authorities can punish them and act in their defence, as clearly provided in law; and (b) from the facts presented by the complainant union, it is clear that the actions of the JLCADF and the relevant authorities were at all times carried out in a timely and appropriate manner, within the legally established terms and conditions, in conformity with legislation and in full compliance with the powers conferred upon them by its own regulations. A case in point is the request for the recognition of STRM branch 187, which was processed and granted, resulting in it being legally recognized. Another is the ballots that were conducted following the request for bargaining rights under the collective agreement of Atento Servicios SA de CV, in which JLCADF procedures adhered to legislative provisions, unfailingly safeguarding workers' rights and safety, complying with the legally required procedure and respecting the wishes of the workers in the free choice of the union that should manage the collective bargaining agreement, given that it is not the JLCADF that grants bargaining rights, but the workers through their vote. The authority only legitimizes the decision when issuing the award based on the results, with absolute transparency and the participation of all parties involved.\n647.In no circumstances can it be considered that there has been any omission on the part of the Mexican State, either directly or through the conduct of the authorities involved, as its actions have unfailingly been in accordance with legislation and, in this regard, the principles contained in ILO Conventions Nos 87 and 98 have not been violated. On the contrary, the Government has taken clear actions to strengthen freedom of association, the right to organize and to collective bargaining, proof of which can be seen in the adoption of amendments to the Federal Labour Act, published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on 30 November 2012 in order to ensure compliance.\n648.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant union (STRM) alleges: (1) anti-union dismissals following the establishment of its branch 187 in Atento Servicios SA de CV (six named members in July 2009 and another six in October 2009, and 50 unnamed members who worked in the company s Pachuca and Toluca centres); (2) union security clauses in favour of the SPTCTRM that allow the employer to dismiss workers who are not members of the STRM. The complainant also alleges automatic membership of this union upon recruitment; (3) various irregularities (which the complainant details in its complaint) by the company, the SPTCTRM union and the authorities in the second ballot process requested by the STRM on two occasions (December 2009 and following a decision of the relevant judicial authority (under an appeal) approving a new ballot requested by the STRM, which finally took place in November 2011). According to the complainant, the irregularities referred to resulted in the STRM not winning the ballot.\n649.The Committee notes the Government s statements denying the violation of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association and according to which: (1) the STRM fails to provide the names of (all) the dismissed workers, or give the alleged unjustified reasons, or to state whether they took any legal, judicial or other actions; (2) STRM branch 187 obtained its recognition within the legal deadlines; (3) the STRM has not provided evidence to support its allegation of mass and enforced membership of the other union and, in any case, exclusion clauses (union security clause) were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Justice in 2001 and the same criteria were followed in the last reform of the Federal Labour Act of 30 November 2012, which also includes union transparency provisions; (4) in both ballots, the workers' vote results verified by the authority (the second of which was after the authority had cancelled the first at the request of the complainant union) went against the STRM; (5) legislation provides penalties for a violation of the individual or collective rights of workers and remedies to put them into effect. The Government states that the complaint is subjective and lacks evidence and the November 2011 ballot was conducted in accordance with the law. In general, the Committee observes that the allegations and the Government s reply differ on many points.\n650.Firstly, the Committee wishes to note the difficulty in considering the complaint, partly because, according to the complainant union, union security clauses were used to benefit the other union, because of the lack of information from the STRM on the possible number of appeals filed by members dismissed or disadvantaged (the complainant union also recognizes that in some periods there was restructuring with lay-offs) and partly because some pieces of information raised questions. First, the ballot results which, although clearly in favour of the SPTCTRM, gave surprising results in terms of figures (according to the Government, in the first ballot 372 workers voted for the complainant union ' STRM ' and 1,294 for the SPTCTRM and in the second, out of a total of 579 workers only 47 voted for the STRM). Second, the fact that the authority (Federal District Local Conciliation and Arbitration Board), when ordering a second ballot, noted in its decision that the SPTCTRM union member voting list  clearly contains no record of any company worker'  Third, the finding that the complainant union (STRM) fails to state whether or not it appealed to the authorities against the last ballot (in the previous ballot the STRM had obtained a decision from the authority to repeat the ballot). Furthermore, the Committee notes that, as the authority cancelled the first workers'"", ""to implement the reform, which was presented by senators who are members of corporate federations and therefore reproduces the system of collective protection agreements; and (v) the 2016 protocol on free collective bargaining is no more than a sham as: the inspection dates are decided in advance with the company; the workers questioned during the inspection are selected by the trade union representative and/or the employer (questions simply regarding whether the worker in question is aware of their union and its statutes, whether he or she is aware of the collective agreement and whether the agreement is accessible to workers, in a clear location in the workplace). IndustriALL considers that if a collective employer protection agreement is in place in that workplace (as, according to the complainant, is the case for 90 per cent of workplaces) the replies are controlled by the protection union, rendering the protocol useless. In addition, in order to demonstrate the deficiencies of the public mechanisms, IndustriALL reports that, in response to the impunity and passivity of the labour authorities, a committee of civil society organizations has been established in the textile industry that includes 14 international brands and which carried out a  Campaign for freedom of association in Mexico' with the objective of  challenging the use of protection agreements in their supply chains'  These brands have worked on their own initiative to implement independent monitoring and audits to verify the compliance of their internal codes of conduct with the ILO fundamental Conventions, in particular to address the issue of protection agreements and ensure that the supplier companies with which they have production contracts understand and respect the right to freedom of association. In several cases these private initiatives have managed to resolve serious issues related to rights, dismissals and harassment in factories where protection unions operated.\n30.In addition, IndustriALL provides further information regarding specific situations highlighted in the Committee s previous examination of the complaint and on new cases. With respect to previously presented cases, on which the Government has provided its observations, the complainant indicates that:(a)\tRegarding the STUHM, challenging the Government s report, it emphasizes that: (i) the JFCA ordered the recount within the company and without reliable documentation on the voter register; (ii) during the recount entry was denied to the team of national and international observers and STUHM representatives (union representatives were threatened with firearms by the plant s security personnel when they demanded to be granted entry and they were only permitted to enter following heated arguments and complaints); (iii) throughout the whole procedure inside the plant representatives of the union in question, the Union of Employees and Workers in the Vehicle Manufacturing and Assembly Industry (SETEAMI), and the company continuously threatened the workers with dismissal if they lost the recount; (iv) the list of voters contained persons who should not have voted and company personnel selected those who could access the voting area, which was isolated from the rest of the plant and surrounded by internal security personnel; and (v) the irregularities were reported by the STUHM but they were not addressed by JFCA officials; (vi) the SETEAMI legal representative acted as the representative of the SETEAMI (of the CTM) during the trial before the JFCA and as the coordinator for the advisers of the president of that board, when the STUHM reported this conflict of interest, the individual ceased to represent SETEAMI, but reassumed that role in June 2015; (vii) despite all of the aforementioned irregularities in the recount, the STUHM received 48 per cent of the vote; however, the company refused to grant it the facilities to represent its members, including entry into the plant, office space to meet with members, recognition of its representative and the deduction of trade union dues, and (viii) the executive board of the STUHM remains dismissed and its request for reinstatement is in process.(b)\tRegarding the STRACC: (i) in several stations where it is the titleholder of the collective agreement, employer representatives and protection unions threaten workers in order to coerce them into resigning with a view to hiring new personnel from third party companies; (ii) STRACC leaders, members and representatives have been threatened, attacked, kidnapped and illegally imprisoned as a result of false accusations from employers in collusion with the local and federal Government, in this context, organizing in a union poses a risk for the personal safety of workers and their families; (iii) in the legal action to seek title initiated on 3 June 2014 by the STRACC against the Union of Employers and Workers in the Federal District General Trade Sector and the company, the recount was not held until 31 August 2015, owing to a series of irregularities instigated by the company, the protection union and the Local Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JLCA) of the federal district; (iv) it was not until March 2018 that, after repeated appeals lodged by the company, the STRACC was recognized as the titleholder for this workplace, but in the meantime the majority of workers who had expressed a preference for the STRACC as their trade union had been dismissed and the company is currently dismissing more workers in order to hire new employees through a third party company which operates its own collective protection agreements; (v) in June 2018 in the La Laguna petrol station, after STRACC had obtained the title to the collective labour agreement and had attained various related achievements, first the company threatened the Secretary-General to coerce him into cancelling the collective agreement and subsequently the Secretary-General of a trade union of a federation considered to be corporate contacted him asking how much money he wanted for the collective agreement, an offer which the STRACC representative declined; then armed thugs from the federation concerned hired by the company appeared during each shift change, attempted to oust workers and STRACC members using threats and demanded that they resigned from their jobs and the trade union ' the STRACC issued a call to strike to the company to protect its members, which is pending before the JLCA.(c)\tRegarding the UNTyPP: (i) the oil company held several meetings with the UNTyPP in 2016 and 2017 that did not resolve the key issues such as union representation, the refusal to engage in collective bargaining, open and aggressive interference in trade union operations and the refusal to reinstate those dismissed; (ii) the small number of meetings that have taken place with the company have been held on the insistence of the UNTyPP and the replies were sent electronically to avoid a record being kept of the meetings or of the recognition of the trade union; when the issues were addressed it was by low level officials who did not resolve the conflicts; and (iii) various meetings were held with the STPS which failed to respond to the complaints of the UNTyPP, and the union has not been granted a meeting with the company for about two years, despite its requests.(d)\tRegarding the first car manufacturer: (i) in July 2014 it announced its new plant in San Luis Potos which would begin operations in 2019 and, in the same month, it concluded a collective employer protection agreement signed by the Secretary-General of the Mexican National Automotive Industry, Similar and Allied Workers' Union of the CTM; this agreement was therefore concluded five years before operations were due to begin at the plant and before workers were hired; (ii) the Secretary-General who signed the agreement had concluded 26 other collective agreements in San Luis Potos with automobile and spare parts plants ' although the STPS website indicates that the union concerned has only 153 members ' and that same individual is also the Secretary General of the Federation of Workers of the State of San Luis Potos, which has 25 member unions covering all industrial sectors; (iii) in 2018, as planned, the company was yet to begin operations and had only indicated that it was in the process of training workers provided by the CTM; (iv) however, on the STPS website it appears that the employee section of the collective agreement was revised on 7 March 2018, indicating that it was applicable to 146 active workers at that time ' the number of members of the protection union covered by the protection agreement does not coincide with the number of workers indicated by the Government following a supposed labour inspection nor with the number of workers (361) indicated on its tax return; and (v) the plant is supposed to open in April 2019 and it plans to employ 1,500 direct workers and around 7,500 more  indirect workers' throughout its supply chains ' supposedly all these workers will automatically become members of the aforementioned protection union, covered by a collective protection agreement in the development of which they did not participate and were not consulted.(e)\tRegarding the second car manufacturer: (i) in August 2014 it announced the construction of the plant, which would begin operations in the first half of 2016 and, like the first car manufacturer, at the""]"

Since then, observations have been received from the Government in communications dated 18 April, 5 May and 22 September 1981.\n220.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n221.The dispute arose in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Saul as a result of a collective bargaining disagreement. A strike followed on 6 March 1979 and the workers occupied the plant. According to the complainants, when the workers had locked themselves in the authorities called in the police to break up the strike who, using firearms and tear gas, set fire to the plant and caused the death of several workers.\n222.The complainants alleged that the authorities arrested numerous workers, claiming that the trade union leaders were responsible for the fire. Also, in a letter dated 26 July 1979 the WFTU supplied a list of 12 trade unionists and 3 professors who had allegedly been arrested for organising the strike at the Bemis Handal plant.\n223.The Government replied that the fire was deliberately started by the occupants with the intention of destroying the plant. It stated that the investigation concerning the fire led to the remand in custody of 11 persons on the order of the criminal judge for the purpose of his inquiry, 4 of whom were subsequently released on bail. The other persons under investigation were still detained in San Pedro Sula. The Government also confirmed the death of one worker, which it stated had bean caused by a .22 calibre weapon not used by the police force. It added that a judicial inquiry was under way.\n224.According to this information, the only persons still held in custody pending trial were Hector Hernndez, Jos A. Espinoza, Rigoberto Gutirrez, Edwin Salmn Caas, Oscar Enamorado and Tofilo Castro.\n225.At its March 1980 Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and transmit its observations concerning the alleged detention of five trade unionists, namely, Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon, listed in the WFTU's complaint and about whom no information had been supplied by the Government.\n226.In a telegram of 18 April 1980, confirmed by a letter of 5 May 1980, the Government replied that Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon are no longer in prison. Pedro Brizuela, Herminio Deras and Juan Emilio Oliva have been released, no judicial or police procedure having been brought against them for reasons of health, Victor Sabillon Fernndez, a lawyer suspected of intellectual participation in the events, was never detained and has been able to continue his practice.\n227.The Government explains that the proceedings, because of the voluminous and complex nature of the case, are not yet concluded. It states that the persons still in prison have appointed their lawyers and that the judgement will take place according to law and older the Constitutional safeguards. In a telegram of 22 September, the Government announced that on 19 September 1980 Messrs. Hernndez Morales, Salmon Caas, Enamorado, Gutirrez, Vallecillo and Castro have been released.\n228.With regard to the findings of the inquiry into the death of ore worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that seven persons who had been remanded in custody on the order of the criminal court were released on 19 September 1980, four have been released on bail, no action has been brought against three and one was not detained and was able to continue his activities. The Committee notes however that Jos A. Espinoza has not yet been released and has not been tried.\n229.While taking note of the information supplied by the Government, the Committee recalls that trade union leaders were detained without trial since March 1979, and that one of them is still in detection. In this correction, the Committee points out, as it has done on a number of previous occasions, that in all cases in which trade union leaders are held in custody without trial, these measures may involves a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial on account of tea difficulty of securing evidence is a practice which involves the inherent danger of abuse and is subject to criticism.\n230.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) as regards the remand in custody since March 1979 of Jos A. Espinoza, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth by the Committee in the previous paragraph, especially the fact that such detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights;(ii) as regards the findings of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, as soon as the judgements have been delivered.\n283.Case No. 929 was examined by the Committee in May 1979 when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its 210th Session. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented allegations which were treated in Case No. 938, and the two cases together were considered by the Committee and further interim conclusions were submitted to the Governing Body which approved them at its 211th Session. The Government has submitted additional information in a letter dated 26 December 1979.\n284.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n285.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on 6 March 1979 in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. The WFTU provided a list of trade unionists and professors who had allegedly beau arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.\n286.In its previous replies, the Government stated that during the incidents on 6 March 1979, the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handai undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying it. Investigations led to the detention of 11 persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge, and according to the Government's statements no account was taken of their trade union affiliation in the decision of this judge to detain them. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a .22 calibre weapon not used by the public security forces and stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker. In a later communication the Government stated that two of the persons detained had requested and been granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, along with another detainee.\n287.At its November 1979 Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and to transmit its observations about the WFTU complaint.\n288.In its letter of 26 December 1979, the Government indicates that, on 21 December 1979 two more of the persons detained, Messrs. Adalberto Crdova Turcios and Tmas Nativi, have also been released on bail following medical examinations. The other remaining persons under investigation for the events at the Bemis Handal plant are still detained in San Pedro Sula. Judicial proceedings concerning the eleven persons who had been arrested are still underway.\n289.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the release on bail of two persons involved in the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway against the eleven who had been arrested, and to reiterate its request to the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and reasons adduced therefore, when available;(b) to reiterate its request to the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of 5 trade unionists (namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, and Victor Baillon) listed in the WFTU's complaint and concerning which no information has been supplied;(c) to take note of this interim report.\n499.Case No. 929 has been examined by the Committee in May 1979 when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its 210th Session, The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), by letter dated"", ""26 July 1979, presented further allegations (Case No. 938). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated 30 May 1979 and in letters dated 22 and 28 August 1979.\n500.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n501.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on 6 March 1979 in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of 14 workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of 26 July 1979 provides a list of 12 trade unionists and 3 professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.\n502.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on 6 March 1979, the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of 11 persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a .22 calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.\n503.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the 14 agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,\n504.In its letters of 30 May 1979, the Government indicates that of the 14 agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL, 9 had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in 1978, and were set free by the courts in April and May 1979 because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.\n505.The Government, in its letters of 22 and 28 August 1979, supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on 16 March 1979, 11 men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on 9 July 1979, confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on 28 July 1979. The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.\n506.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the 11 accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.\n507.Regarding the list of 12 trade unionists and 3 professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that 10 of them were amongst those detained on 16 March 1979 for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.\n508.In its letter of 28 August 1979, the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.\n509.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.\n510.Regarding the WCL's allegation that 14 agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n511.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that 11 workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on 16 March 1979 by the criminal court judge and that 3 of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.\n512.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on 5 of the 15 persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.\n513.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of 14 agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released 9 of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph 512 above;(d) to take note of this interim report."", ""26 July 1979, presented further allegations (Case No. 938).

The Case No. 3123 complaint is contained in communications of 26 January 2015 from the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) and of 3 March 2015 from the WFTU.\n603.The Government sent its observations concerning both complaints in a communication of 27 January 2016.\n604.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n605.In its communications of 17 December 2014, and 26 January and 3 March 2015, the complainant organizations make the following allegations.\n606.The complainant organizations allege that the law requires the intervention of the authorized trade unions to determine which dockworkers are to be recruited, in accordance with article 66(c) of Act No. 1248 of 1936 (which requires that dockworkers be nominated by the executive committee of the respective trade union for recruitment). The complainant organizations allege that: (i) under Executive Decree No. 19260/61, various labour jurisdictions were granted to the trade unions of LOMP; (ii) in the port of Caacupe-m, the San Francisco SA enterprise outsourced its dock work to evade the legal requirements, using subcontracting and to that end establishing the affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA; (iii) private port enterprises, and in particular San Francisco SA and its affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA, violate Act No. 1248/36 by hiring workers who are not members of the trade unions authorized for the respective jurisdiction; and (iv) the Prefecture-General for Shipping and the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping, at the instigation of the association of port managers, issue work permits to dockworkers who do not meet the requirements of Act No. 1248/36. In view of this situation, LOMP filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, requesting an inspection to determine whether the dockworkers who are hired comply with the legal requirements relating to authorization and whether they are members of the trade unions authorized to provide access to recruitment (LOMP indicates that the Human Rights Committee of the Senate requested a report from the Prefecture-General for Shipping in a note dated 17 December 2014). Accordingly, on 23 December an inspection report was published, which indicated that three attempts had been necessary before the inspection could be carried out and that it had found that the dockworkers concerned were not employed by either San Francisco SA or by the subcontractor Jerovi Servicios SA and other employees of the latter enterprise were working there at the time. The complainants consider that the inspection report and the enterprise s actions provide evidence that it has committed violations: the inspection report found, firstly, that the workers were not members of any of the trade unions authorized to supply the necessary staff, in violation of article 66 of Act No. 1248/36 and, secondly, that in a tripartite meeting held on 27 November 2014 with representatives of LOMP, the representatives of San Francisco SA claimed the right to hire workers of their choosing. The complainants conclude that, by allowing the enterprise to choose its dockworkers and the fact that the Prefecture-General for Shipping authorizes this, the State is violating the legal provisions in force.\n607.Furthermore, the complainant organizations refer to a number of collective agreements recognizing the trade unions' right to propose dockworkers for recruitment in the labour jurisdictions for which those trade unions are authorized (in particular, the collective agreement of 1956 between the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers and Related Services (SEMA) and the Small and Large-Scale Cabotage Shipowners/Association of River Shipowners (CAF); the collective agreement adopted by a decision of 19 February 1988 between the Association of Shipping Agents (ASAMAR) and the Trade Union of Port Checking Clerks of the Capital (SAPAC, a member of LOMP); and the agreement of 4 May 2004 between SEMA and the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu). The complainants report that, although in the past the public authorities, including the judiciary, had recognized the applicability of these collective agreements and the jurisdiction of the trade unions, in recent years there has been a failure to apply the provisions contained in the agreements concerning the role of the trade unions in the selection of workers. In particular, they allege that the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, through the Prefecture-General for Shipping, allow and even encourage non-compliance with the collective agreement between ASAMAR and SAPAC and that the Supreme Court of Justice revoked the aforementioned collective agreement by Ruling No. 1325 of 7 September 2006 (not allowing the participation of the trade unions in the judicial proceedings ' a matter which was the subject of another allegation).\n608.The WFTU also alleges that the private port enterprises refuse collective bargaining, even though article 334 of the Labour Code provides that enterprises with more than 20 workers are obliged to enter into a collective agreement governing conditions of work.\n609.The WFTU indicates that the owners of the Caacupe-m port dismissed more than 200 workers simply because they were trade union members and that, while some of these workers managed to get reinstated, the dismissal of the other workers is still effective. LOMP, for its part, alleges the unfair dismissal of 60 workers.\n610.The complainant organizations indicate that the employers in the private ports refuse to hire workers who are members of LOMP trade unions (despite being in labour jurisdictions granted to those trade unions) and that they only hire workers individually on condition that they do not join a union.\n611.The complainant organizations indicate that LOMP organized a demonstration on 13 November 2014 for workers in their member trade unions to protest against the violations of their members' rights by the San Francisco SA enterprise and its affiliated company, Jerovi Servicios SA, in dismissing 60 workers. The complainants indicate that eight to ten canoes took up positions on the Paraguay River as a symbolic act of protest, while a demonstration was being held on land opposite the Caacupe-m port. The complainants indicate that these flimsy canoes did not constitute any obstacle for vessels of any size moving along the Paraguay River; in fact, when the launch from the Prefecture-General for Shipping passed by, the wash was strong enough to overturn one of the canoes. The complainants indicate that, in response to an action filed by the enterprise, the Criminal Judge of Guarantees No. 8 of the capital issued an emergency preventive measure, under a ruling of 15 December of 2014, ordering the workers to refrain from obstructing freedom of movement on the Paraguay River and from preventing the entry and exit of vehicles and persons to and from the port premises, whereupon the Prefecture-General for Shipping intervened to arrest the workers who were protesting. The complainants consider that, under this preventive measure, a decision was taken on the substance of the matter without requiring the claimant to pay the bond for costs, as provided for by law. The complainants add that, as a result of the complaint filed by the enterprise, an order was given for the detention of 11 workers ' whose names are listed in the complaint by LOMP ' who were placed in preventive detention on the basis of article 214 of the Criminal Code of Paraguay (concerning dangerous interference in shipping) and are facing a six-year prison sentence. The complainants add that, following an appeal against the preventive detention measure, the 11 workers were put under house arrest, which still prevents them from working or supporting their families. The complainants consider that the preventive measures violate freedom of association.\n612.The complainant organizations allege that repeated rulings of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice curtail trade union freedom by restricting the trade unions' ability to represent their members. The complainants refer to three rulings in particular:(i) Ruling No. 1812 of 20 December 2004 concerning a claim for the payment of wages to SEMA members, brought against a shipping enterprise domiciled outside Paraguay that occasionally employed a national enterprise to manage unloading and other services. In this ruling, the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the  law does not authorize trade unions to represent their members vis--vis the judicial authorities without an express mandate' and that  the ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, but it is currently the legal provision in force, whereby the law does not confer direct procedural competence on the trade unions to represent their members before the courts, requiring the maximum authority of the trade union ' the assembly ' to grant an express mandate to bring legal actions' and that the trade union did not provide any kind of instrument conferring such authorization. The complainants allege, however, that the court had received the minutes of SEMA s general assembly, which were incorporated into a valid public instrument (pp. 29' 3), and this shows that the assembly"", ""602.The Case No. 3110 complaint is contained in a communication of 17 December 2014 from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The Case No. 3123 complaint is contained in communications of 26 January 2015 from the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) and of 3 March 2015 from the WFTU.\n603.The Government sent its observations concerning both complaints in a communication of 27 January 2016.\n604.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n605.In its communications of 17 December 2014, and 26 January and 3 March 2015, the complainant organizations make the following allegations.\n606.The complainant organizations allege that the law requires the intervention of the authorized trade unions to determine which dockworkers are to be recruited, in accordance with article 66(c) of Act No. 1248 of 1936 (which requires that dockworkers be nominated by the executive committee of the respective trade union for recruitment). The complainant organizations allege that: (i) under Executive Decree No. 19260/61, various labour jurisdictions were granted to the trade unions of LOMP; (ii) in the port of Caacupe-m, the San Francisco SA enterprise outsourced its dock work to evade the legal requirements, using subcontracting and to that end establishing the affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA; (iii) private port enterprises, and in particular San Francisco SA and its affiliated company Jerovi Servicios SA, violate Act No. 1248/36 by hiring workers who are not members of the trade unions authorized for the respective jurisdiction; and (iv) the Prefecture-General for Shipping and the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping, at the instigation of the association of port managers, issue work permits to dockworkers who do not meet the requirements of Act No. 1248/36. In view of this situation, LOMP filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, requesting an inspection to determine whether the dockworkers who are hired comply with the legal requirements relating to authorization and whether they are members of the trade unions authorized to provide access to recruitment (LOMP indicates that the Human Rights Committee of the Senate requested a report from the Prefecture-General for Shipping in a note dated 17 December 2014). Accordingly, on 23 December an inspection report was published, which indicated that three attempts had been necessary before the inspection could be carried out and that it had found that the dockworkers concerned were not employed by either San Francisco SA or by the subcontractor Jerovi Servicios SA and other employees of the latter enterprise were working there at the time. The complainants consider that the inspection report and the enterprise s actions provide evidence that it has committed violations: the inspection report found, firstly, that the workers were not members of any of the trade unions authorized to supply the necessary staff, in violation of article 66 of Act No. 1248/36 and, secondly, that in a tripartite meeting held on 27 November 2014 with representatives of LOMP, the representatives of San Francisco SA claimed the right to hire workers of their choosing. The complainants conclude that, by allowing the enterprise to choose its dockworkers and the fact that the Prefecture-General for Shipping authorizes this, the State is violating the legal provisions in force.\n607.Furthermore, the complainant organizations refer to a number of collective agreements recognizing the trade unions' right to propose dockworkers for recruitment in the labour jurisdictions for which those trade unions are authorized (in particular, the collective agreement of 1956 between the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers and Related Services (SEMA) and the Small and Large-Scale Cabotage Shipowners/Association of River Shipowners (CAF); the collective agreement adopted by a decision of 19 February 1988 between the Association of Shipping Agents (ASAMAR) and the Trade Union of Port Checking Clerks of the Capital (SAPAC, a member of LOMP); and the agreement of 4 May 2004 between SEMA and the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu). The complainants report that, although in the past the public authorities, including the judiciary, had recognized the applicability of these collective agreements and the jurisdiction of the trade unions, in recent years there has been a failure to apply the provisions contained in the agreements concerning the role of the trade unions in the selection of workers. In particular, they allege that the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, through the Prefecture-General for Shipping, allow and even encourage non-compliance with the collective agreement between ASAMAR and SAPAC and that the Supreme Court of Justice revoked the aforementioned collective agreement by Ruling No. 1325 of 7 September 2006 (not allowing the participation of the trade unions in the judicial proceedings ' a matter which was the subject of another allegation).\n608.The WFTU also alleges that the private port enterprises refuse collective bargaining, even though article 334 of the Labour Code provides that enterprises with more than 20 workers are obliged to enter into a collective agreement governing conditions of work.\n609.The WFTU indicates that the owners of the Caacupe-m port dismissed more than 200 workers simply because they were trade union members and that, while some of these workers managed to get reinstated, the dismissal of the other workers is still effective. LOMP, for its part, alleges the unfair dismissal of 60 workers.\n610.The complainant organizations indicate that the employers in the private ports refuse to hire workers who are members of LOMP trade unions (despite being in labour jurisdictions granted to those trade unions) and that they only hire workers individually on condition that they do not join a union.\n611.The complainant organizations indicate that LOMP organized a demonstration on 13 November 2014 for workers in their member trade unions to protest against the violations of their members' rights by the San Francisco SA enterprise and its affiliated company, Jerovi Servicios SA, in dismissing 60 workers. The complainants indicate that eight to ten canoes took up positions on the Paraguay River as a symbolic act of protest, while a demonstration was being held on land opposite the Caacupe-m port. The complainants indicate that these flimsy canoes did not constitute any obstacle for vessels of any size moving along the Paraguay River; in fact, when the launch from the Prefecture-General for Shipping passed by, the wash was strong enough to overturn one of the canoes. The complainants indicate that, in response to an action filed by the enterprise, the Criminal Judge of Guarantees No. 8 of the capital issued an emergency preventive measure, under a ruling of 15 December of 2014, ordering the workers to refrain from obstructing freedom of movement on the Paraguay River and from preventing the entry and exit of vehicles and persons to and from the port premises, whereupon the Prefecture-General for Shipping intervened to arrest the workers who were protesting. The complainants consider that, under this preventive measure, a decision was taken on the substance of the matter without requiring the claimant to pay the bond for costs, as provided for by law. The complainants add that, as a result of the complaint filed by the enterprise, an order was given for the detention of 11 workers ' whose names are listed in the complaint by LOMP ' who were placed in preventive detention on the basis of article 214 of the Criminal Code of Paraguay (concerning dangerous interference in shipping) and are facing a six-year prison sentence. The complainants add that, following an appeal against the preventive detention measure, the 11 workers were put under house arrest, which still prevents them from working or supporting their families. The complainants consider that the preventive measures violate freedom of association.\n612.The complainant organizations allege that repeated rulings of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice curtail trade union freedom by restricting the trade unions' ability to represent their members. The complainants refer to three rulings in particular:(i) Ruling No. 1812 of 20 December 2004 concerning a claim for the payment of wages to SEMA members, brought against a shipping enterprise domiciled outside Paraguay that occasionally employed a national enterprise to manage unloading and other services. In this ruling, the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the  law does not authorize trade unions to represent their members vis--vis the judicial authorities without an express mandate' and that  the ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, but it is currently the legal provision in force, whereby the law does not confer direct procedural competence on the trade unions to represent their members before the courts, requiring the maximum authority of the trade union ' the assembly ' to grant an express mandate to bring legal actions' and that the trade union did not provide any kind of instrument conferring such authorization. The complainants allege, however, that the court had received the minutes of SEMA s general assembly, which were incorporated into a valid public instrument (pp. 29' 3), and this shows that the assembly"", 'institute an inquiry and take all necessary measures to remedy the effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention.\n364.The complaint in Case No. 1510 was submitted by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in September 1989 and was examined by the Committee at its meeting of May 1990, when the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See 272nd Report, paras. 506-526, approved by the Governing Body at its 246th Session (May-June 1990).)\n365.The complaints in Case No. 1546 were submitted by the Paraguay Flight Attendants\' Association (APAV) (27 July 1990), the International Flight Attendants\' Association (IFAA) (28 August 1990) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) (13 September 1990). The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) supported the complaint submitted by the ICFTU in a communication of 25 October 1990.\n366.At its February 1991 meeting (see 277th Report, para. 11), the Committee observed that, despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the complaints (Cases Nos. 1510 and 1546), it had still not received the observations requested from the Government. The Committee thus drew the attention of the Government (as it had already done at its February 1990 meeting in connection with Case No. 1510) to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph 17 of its 127th Report, the Committee would examine the substance of the complaints at its next meeting even if the observations or information requested from the Government were not received in due time. In spite of this new urgent appeal, the Committee has still not received information from the Government on these two cases.\n367.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n374.Once again, the Committee deeply deplores the Government\'s failure to cooperate with the Committee\'s procedure and, specifically, the fact that it has sent none of the information requested on numerous occasions, including urgent appeals, concerning Cases Nos. 1510 and 1546. Owing to the time elapsed since the allegations were submitted (between ten and 20 months) the Committee has been forced into examining these cases without the benefit of the Government\'s reply.\n375.The Committee emphasises that on the occasion of its first examination of Case No. 1510 (May 1990), as well, it had no choice but to examine the case without the benefit of the Government\'s reply, and that in February 1991 it examined three other cases concerning Paraguay (Nos. 1435, 1446 and 1519) in the same circumstances.\n376.The Committee cannot accept this persistent attitude by the Government, especially in the light of the seriousness of the allegations contained in Cases Nos. 1510 and 1546, which refer to the arrest and dismissal of trade union leaders, the violent repression of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric enterprise which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injured, the dismissal from several enterprises of 519 workers who were seeking to set up trade unions or to join them, and a number of other anti-union practices. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government in the future to send detailed replies to allegations without delay and cautions the Government that it reserves the right in the future to distribute and give the greatest publicity to its reports, as provided for in its procedural rules. (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, 3rd edition, 1985, para. 64.)\n377.As regards Case No. 1546, the Committee notes that the complainants refer to and present documents as supporting evidence of anti-union measures concerning the transfer and subsequent dismissal of Messrs. Antonio Garca, Ralf Gehre, Ren Salomn and Francisco Montanaro, leaders of the Paraguay Flight Attendants\' Association (APAV), each of whom had more than 12 years of service in the Lneas Areas Paraguayas enterprise: (1) the transfers (November 1989) and dismissals (December 1989) occurred only a few months after the Association was given legal personality (August 1989); (2) these transfers affect four of the 11 leaders of the APAV (including its president and vice-president), to the exclusion of other workers, leaving the four at a distinct disadvantage inasmuch as they were compelled to leave their positions as flight supervisors to work at adminstrative tasks in the preparation of manuals and basic filing; (3) the Association had been denouncing the labour practices of the enterprise, which had requested the courts to annul the decision of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the Association as a trade union, on the grounds that flight attendants were civil servants and therefore not entitled to form a union; (4) according to the complainants, other members of the Association have also been pressured to resign from the union.\n378.The Committee concludes that the transfer and subsequent dismissal of the four above-mentioned trade union leaders violates Article 1 of Convention No. 98, according to which ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of providing remedies against such acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Lneas Areas Paraguayas will immediately reinstate the four dismissed trade union leaders.\n379.The Committee also emphasises that in accordance with Article 4 of Convention No. 98, workers\' organisations (with the sole possible exception of civil servants engaged in the administration of the State referred to in Article 6 of Convention No. 98), and thus flight attendants\' organisations as well, should have the right to regulate their conditions of employment through collective agreements with the employer or with an employers\' organisation. The Committee thus requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee the right of flight attendants\' organisations to collective bargaining by means of collective agreements.\n380.As regards Case No. 1510, the Committee reiterates the conclusions and recommendations which it formulated at its May 1990 meeting (see the section above, entitled ""Previous examination of Case No. 1510"").\n381.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)The Committee once more deeply deplores the Government\'s total failure to cooperate with the Committee\'s procedure, and regrets that it has been obliged to examine the cases without the benefit of the Government\'s reply.(b)The Committee cannot accept the Government\'s persistent attitude, especially in the light of the seriousness of the allegations. The Committee therefore urges the Government in the future to send without delay detailed replies to allegations, and draws its attention to the fact that the Committee reserves the right to distribute and give wide publicity to its reports in accordance with its procedural rules.(c)As regards Case No. 1546, the Committee considers that the transfers and subsequent dismissals of Messrs. Antonio Garca, Ralf Gehre, Ren Salomn and Francisco Montanaro (leaders of the Paraguay Flight Attendants\' Association) violate Article 1 of Convention No. 98, and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Lneas Areas Paraguayas will immediately reinstate these four trade union leaders, and to keep the Committee informed in this connection.(d)The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee that flight attendants\' organisations enjoy the right to bargain collectively by means of collective agreements.(e)As regards Case No. 1510, the Committee reiterates the recommendations which it formulated at its May 1990 meeting, which are as follows:- As regards the allegation that 519 workers in different branches of activity and enterprises, identified by name, have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join a trade union, the Committee emphasises the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to set up and join trade unions, and that workers should benefit from adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation, and to keep it informed in this connection.- As regards the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Clandelino Benitez, a leader of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salceco, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.- As regards the allegations of the army\'s violent repression of a strike at the Itapu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on 12 December 1989, the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also requests to be kept informed of the results of any']"

These allegations, which constitute Case No. 620, will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of 15 September 1970.\n40.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n49.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to take note of the fact that it would appear from the information supplied by the Government that all effects of the measures denounced in the allegations have now ceased, and to decide, subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph 43, that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the intention of the Government to make trade union membership compulsory and to create a single union, to decide, while reaffirming the principles set forth in paragraph 47, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n316.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these five cases are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegation. The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated 13 and 23 January 1969, one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated 10 January 1969, one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated 22 February 1969, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated 15 March 1969, one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated 9 June 1969 and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated 30 September 1969.\n317.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated 21 and 28 January 1970.\n318.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n319.In its communication dated 13 January 1969 the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated 23 January 1969 the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October 1968 had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n320.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of 23 February 1969 that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since 15 December 1968. The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n321.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated 14 March 1969 that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n322.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of 9 June 1969 that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.\n323.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated 30 September 1969 that on 11 October 1968 individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on 4 September 1969 in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on 13 September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.\n324.In its communications dated 21 and 28 January 1970 the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after 11 October 1968 had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.\n325.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October 1968. Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities. The Government points out"", ""37.The Committee last examined this case at its session in February 1970, when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which is contained in paragraphs 316 to 330 of its 116th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its 178th Session (March 1970).\n38.A number of allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises remained outstanding, with respect to which the Government has now forwarded its observations by a communication dated 15 September 1970.\n39.In addition, on 16 and 20 January 1970, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) made further allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights in connection with the Government's intention to make trade union membership compulsory and create a single union.

The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on 4 September 1969 in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on 13 September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.\n324.In its communications dated 21 and 28 January 1970 the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after 11 October 1968 had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.\n325.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October 1968. Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities. The Government points out"", ""37.The Committee last examined this case at its session in February 1970, when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which is contained in paragraphs 316 to 330 of its 116th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its 178th Session (March 1970).\n38.A number of allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises remained outstanding, with respect to which the Government has now forwarded its observations by a communication dated 15 September 1970.\n39.In addition, on 16 and 20 January 1970, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) made further allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights in connection with the Government's intention to make trade union membership compulsory and create a single union. These allegations, which constitute Case No. 620, will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of 15 September 1970.\n40.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n49.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to take note of the fact that it would appear from the information supplied by the Government that all effects of the measures denounced in the allegations have now ceased, and to decide, subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph 43, that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the intention of the Government to make trade union membership compulsory and to create a single union, to decide, while reaffirming the principles set forth in paragraph 47, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n316.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these five cases are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegation. The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated 13 and 23 January 1969, one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated 10 January 1969, one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated 22 February 1969, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated 15 March 1969, one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated 9 June 1969 and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated 30 September 1969.\n317.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated 21 and 28 January 1970.\n318.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n319.In its communication dated 13 January 1969 the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated 23 January 1969 the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October 1968 had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n320.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of 23 February 1969 that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since 15 December 1968. The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n321.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated 14 March 1969 that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n322.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of 9 June 1969 that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers.

It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November 1974 onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June 1977 session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article 26 of the ILO Constitution.\n11.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in 1974 were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No. 11947 (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No. 11952 (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No. 11948 (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November 1974. Legislative Decree No. 11947 provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 11948, establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January 1975, but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n12.The complaint filed under article 26 of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. 87. Mention was made in particular of the comments of 1975 concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n13.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April 1977, the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers\' and workers\' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers\' and workers\' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n14.In May 1977 the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.\n15.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July 1976. According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers\' Congress (May 1976), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers\' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners\' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n16.In November 1976 the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners\' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n17.In February 1977 the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No. 14256 of 31 December 1976, whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n18.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April 1977, the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations.

The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n16.In November 1976 the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners\' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n17.In February 1977 the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No. 14256 of 31 December 1976, whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n18.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April 1977, the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations.

Furthermore, it considers that these negative practices are inconsistent with the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectiveness that should prevail in the handling of trade union freedoms. The Government therefore anticipates that it will be possible, on the basis of the elements submitted in its observations, to dismiss all of the allegations relating to the present case as baseless.\n204.With regard to recommendation (a), the Government states once again that ASIC is not a trade union organization, given that: (i) it does not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests; (ii) it does not have the genuine support of any labour collective and is not a grouping of Cuban workers; (iii) the supposed leaders or activists referred to in the complaint do not represent labour collectives and are not workers themselves, as they do not have fixed employment relationships with entities or employers in Cuba, thus they do not come within the purview of the ILO, and the labour laws are therefore not applicable to them; (iv) the Government of the United States, through the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy, funds ASIC leaders, who, in exchange for a sum of money, have to pose as independent trade union activists, dissidents or critics of the Government and report false violations of workers' rights; (v) the 2013 Labour Code (Act No. 116 of 2013) includes as its fundamental principles the right of workers to organize voluntarily and establish trade unions; (vi) the trade union organizations that make up the Confederation of Workers of Cuba (CTC) are autonomous and their members approve their own statutes and regulations, discuss and reach agreements democratically, and elect or dismiss their executives; (vii) national unions have 3,151,128 members and 95.1 per cent of Cuban workers are unionized; and (viii) Cuban workers are the beneficiaries of participatory and democratic social dialogue at all decision-making levels.\n205.With regard to recommendation (b), the Government indicates that the persons mentioned in the complaint have engaged in antisocial and criminal behaviour. It denies that any arbitrary or temporary detentions or arrests are carried out because these are effected in conformity with the criminal procedure in force and are strictly in line with the guarantees of due process that are recognized in the domestic legal system. It further indicates that institutions and security forces perform their duties in strict accordance with the law and it is not their practice to repress, intimidate, harass, torture or mistreat citizens. It recalls that the internal system provides procedures and resources to punish any authority or official overstepping its powers.\n206.Concerning the individual cases mentioned by the complainant, the Government states that:(a)\tit is untrue that Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is a political prisoner: (i) the chamber for crimes against state security of the People s Provincial Court of Havana found him guilty in 2003 of the offence of acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the State, provided for in the Act on the Protection of National Independence and the Economy of Cuba (Act No. 88 of 1999), and sentenced him to 25 years' imprisonment; (ii) on 23 March 2011, he was granted parole (his conviction will expire in the first half of 2028); (iii) he cannot travel outside the country under article 25(b) of the Migration Act (Act No. 1312 of 1976, as amended by Decree Law No. 302 of 2012); and (iv) in July 2016, September 2017 and March 2018, three charges were brought against him for disobedience, incitement to commit a crime and contempt, which are offences provided for in the Criminal Code (Act No. 62 of 1987), which the Cuban authorities decided to handle as minor offences (with the imposition of administrative measures, including fines and specific obligations and prohibitions);(b)\tMr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, who also has no employment relationship, was prosecuted for illegal gambling and administrative proceedings were also filed against him for the illegal rental of a home and a fine imposed for the illegal possession of psychotropic substances. In addition, he was twice prosecuted for illicit economic activities. With regard to action taken against him by the immigration authorities, this was because of his past record of antisocial and criminal behaviour. He has never been arrested, but simply interviewed, fully respecting the guarantees provided by law;(c)\tMr Jorge Anglada Mayeta was not beaten up by a police officer while trying to defend a self-employed worker. Mr Anglada pounced on and assaulted a police officer carrying out his duties without prior warning or legitimate cause, which constitutes an offence in criminal legislation throughout the world. On 16 February 2018, the Municipal People s Court of La Habana Vieja, having respected all guarantees of due process, found him guilty of assault and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment with a restriction of liberty order for an equal period of time;(d)\tMr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos and Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma were prosecuted following allegations relating to acts classified as offences under Cuban legislation (illicit economic activities, illegal gambling, possession of psychotropic substances, speculation and hoarding, possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, usurpation of public office, handling stolen goods, contempt, causing serious injury, damage, forgery of documents and public disorder). Given that domestic legislation allows for conduct of low risk to society to be subject to administrative proceedings, the authorities handled the above as minor offences;(e)\tcriminal proceedings were not instituted against Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo because he was allegedly exercising his trade union rights, and neither did the authorities commit any acts of persecution or harassment against him. The aforementioned person is not a trade union leader and has never been subjected to harassment or pressure by the authorities. He was prosecuted by the People s Municipal Court of Trinidad for contempt and sentenced to a one-year prison term with custodial hard labour, and is currently out on parole;(f)\tMr Yoanny Limonta Garca, who is also not a union official and has no employment relationship, was subjected to police checks because of his repeated commission of acts classified as offences and other antisocial behaviour (in 2011 for speculation, in 2013 for possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, and in 2016 for usurpation of public office);(g)\tMr Mateo Moreno Ramn and Mr Leandro Vladimir Aguilera Pea were not arrested; they simply received warnings from the relevant authorities, in strict compliance with the law, to prevent them from carrying out their criminal intentions;(h)\tthe restrictions on the right to free movement of Mr Osvaldo Rodrguez Daz and Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar were implemented in accordance with current migration legislation. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has had no employment relationship since 2013 and has a long history of violation of existing rules, regulations and laws, including allegations of illegal economic activities and disobedience. The allegations of threats and harassment against him and his wife are also untrue. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has participated in several trade union events and workshops abroad funded by a foreign power. In 2018, as part of his activities against Cuba, he travelled to Geneva in the context of the 107th International Labour Conference. During the current year, his freedom to travel has not been arbitrarily restricted and the authorities have acted only in accordance with migration law(i)\tMs Magela Garcs Ramrez wrote and disseminated an article in which she made serious and groundless accusations against a significant number of artists and art institutions and, given the seriousness of the allegations, her employer decided that she should work for a different art collection, which is why she decided to resign from her post; and(j)\tMs Sara Cuba Delgado was not subjected to surveillance and harassment by state officials.\n207.With respect to the restrictions on ASIC members and officials travelling and participating in international events, the Government indicates that current migration legislation determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right of a citizen to leave the country and this power is exercised by the relevant authorities in a non-arbitrary manner and respecting legal guarantees. It also denies preventing certain persons from leaving their homes during the 1 May celebrations or imposing house arrests.\n208.With regard to recommendation (c) concerning the exercise of the right to strike in practice, the Government states that current legislation does not include any prohibition of this right and that criminal legislation does not provide for any penalty for exercising this right. The fact that workers do not use this mechanism is not due to a legislative prohibition but to the fact that they have the option of resorting to other more effective means at their disposal, including a number of different forms of meaningful participation and the exercise of genuine decision-making power on matters that concern them. Furthermore, the protection of trade"", 'offensive interrogation;- according to the complainant organization\'s sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n212.In its reply, the Government cited the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n213.Referring to various allegations, the Government made the following observations:- the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On 24 May, she was summoned to the 9th station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in the Capri district, and was given a warning for having carried provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August 1994;- as regards Lzaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lzaro Corp Yeras left the country in September 1994, when he went to live in the United States;- the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers\' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question;- there are 18 national sectoral trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around 98 per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers\' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.\n214.The Committee formulated the following recommendations (see 300th Report, para. 427):- the Committee requests the Government to open a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries allegedly inflicted on the trade union official Lzaro Corp and his younger son, and to keep it informed in this respect;- as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of and threats and other acts of harassment against Enid Amelia Luque, Organization Secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba, the Committee requests the Government to provide the more detailed information to which reference is made in the conclusions, so that it can examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts (in this respect, in its conclusions, the Committee had pointed out that the Government had not explained the substance of the ""acts of provocation against public order"" by Enid Amelia Luque and ""four delinquents"", and which resulted in a ""warning"" being delivered in the offices of the national police, or of the ""demonstration"" against her conduct by neighbours from the district, or the content of the ""warning"" by the national police (see 300th Report, para. 425));- finally, noting that the Government had not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organization in its communication of 7 July 1995, the Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on:- - the refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC);- - the arrest and harassment of and threats against several officials of the CTDC;- - the expulsion from his work centre of a trade unionist of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization after he had called for better working conditions.\n215.In its communication of 12 September 1996, the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras and his son were not attacked by ""persons linked with the Cuban security forces"", as stated by the complainant organization without providing any proof. No formal complaint to this effect has been lodged with any police unit. It was also ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras is not a trade union official, nor does he represent any workers\' collective or have an employment relationship with any workplace. This person left the country in September 1994.\n216.As regards the allegations concerning Ms. Enid Amelia Luque, the Government states that in addition to the information given in its previous reply of 13 July 1995, which it confirms, according to the inquiries made, Ms. Enid Amelia Luque caused a public scandal and disorder near her place of residence, making offensive statements to which the neighbours reacted by expressing rejection of her conduct. There were no acts of violence, only a public scandal, disrupting neighbourly relations. The Government adds that the warning in question was issued in accordance with procedural law, at a meeting with police instructors at which the person is informed of the offence and warned not to repeat it. It is not true that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque was placed in a cell or subjected to a body search. She spent a short period of time in the police office, only in order to comply with the established procedures. Ms. Enid Amelia Luque is not a trade unionist, nor is she a union official, nor does she represent any workers\' collective. She does not have an employment relationship with any workplace. She left the country in August 1994.\n217.As regards the allegations presented by the ICFTU in its communication of 7 July 1995, the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that there is no trade union called the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba in any enterprise or labour body in the entire country. The persons referred to in the ICFTU\'s letter dated 7 July 1995, Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln, Jess Crdenas Lpez and Ren Jos Montero Garay, are not trade union officials, nor have they been subjected to threats and harassment. These persons have been neither nominated nor elected in any workplace in the country as representatives of any workers\' collective. Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln left the country in March 1996.\n218.As regards the alleged expulsion of a trade unionist who, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, was a member of a Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that this person was transferred from his post as a disciplinary administrative measure on three occasions for unjustified absence from work and for being disrespectful to his superiors and fellow workers. These measures were imposed in accordance with the labour legislation in force, and the worker submitted to them without availing himself of the remedies laid down in the legislation. On 10 October 1992, he requested leave from his workplace in order to evade another labour sanction for the same reasons. Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos has never been nominated or elected by the workers of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill as a union official. Eduardo Lamas Campos has a criminal record.', 'whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article 2 of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (Article 3 of the Convention)"".\n399.The complaint is contained in a communication of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated 20 October 1994. This organization sent additional information in a communication dated 20 July 1995.\n400.At its meeting of June 1995, noting that it had not received any reply to the allegations from the Government, the Committee made an urgent appeal and indicated that in accordance with procedure it would examine the case at its next meeting even if the Government\'s reply had not been received (see 299th Report of the Committee, para. 8).\n401.The Government replied to the allegations contained in the first communication from the ICFTU in a communication dated 13 July 1995.\n402.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n403.In its communication of 20 October 1994, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, one of the leaders of the Union of Workers of Cuba (USTC), was twice refused permission to leave Cuba to attend meetings of the ICFTU Committee on Human and Trade Union Rights, held in November 1993 and June 1994. The Government alleged that Mr. Gutierrez was still subject to a sentence resulting from his opposition to the Government; the real reason for the refusal was that for the last two years he had been trying to secure official recognition of the USTC, and had been imprisoned for that reason, but released following pressure brought to bear by the international trade union movement. The non-recognition of the USTC was examined by the Committee in its 287th Report (Case No. 1628), paras. 280-282). In protest against the Government\'s refusal to let him leave Cuba, Mr. Gutierrez went on a hunger strike on 22 June, which he ended on 1 July, due to the solidarity expressed by the international trade union movement.\n404.The ICFTU adds that according to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC, was summoned to appear on 24 May 1994 at the Department of State Security, located in Reparto Capri, in the Havana municipality of Arroyo Naranjo, by the commander of this body. Inside the aforementioned premises, the official threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Mrs. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"".\n405.The ICFTU also alleges during the week of 4-9 July 1994 that CTDC officials were the victims of a violent demonstration by the so-called ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the residence of Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC. The dissidents Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also at her residence at the time. Officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba participated in this demonstration.\n406.Furthermore, on 2 August 1994, in the Avenida 19 del Rpto. Siboney, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault, the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lazaro Corp, once again shows the flagrant violation by the Government of Cuba of internationally recognized trade union rights and principles.\n407.After condemning the terrible harassment to which independent trade unionists in Cuba are subject, and which has often been denounced by the ICFTU, this organization emphasizes the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba.\n408.In its communication of 7 July 1995, the ICFTU alleges that the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is especially the case of Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen (president), Jesus Crdenas Lpez (vice-president) and Rene Jos Montero Garay (secretary responsible for international relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain its legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration.\n409.The ICFTU states that on 29 September 1994, at 1 p.m., Mr. Rene Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones esquine Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that both he himself and Martinez Guillen and Jesus Crdenas would be sentenced to 12-15 years\' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued their defence of the Cuban working class. Moreover, on 10 November 1994, at 2.40 p.m., Messrs. Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen, President of the CTDC, and Jesus Crdenas Lpez, vice-president of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation.\n410.The ICFTU also states that, according to its sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization, in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was both small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n411.In its communication of 13 July 1995, the Government explains that the delay in sending its reply was due mainly to the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the communication from the ICFTU, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n412.That being said, the Government adds that the inquiries carried out on the basis of the scant information contained in the complaint have shown that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez could not complete his plans to travel to a foreign country since at that time he was on bail pending legal proceedings against him in the criminal courts. Mr. Rafael Gutierrez subsequently left the country on the dates given by the ICFTU in its communication.\n413.The Government adds that the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On 24 May, she was summoned to the ninth station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in Reparto Capri, and was given a warning for having carried out provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. The Government states that it is incorrect that Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Wilmer Lazaro Mora Beltran were the victims of a violent demonstration or that they were at the residence of the said Enid Amelia Luque when a group of neighbours']"

The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No. 1328 in a communication dated 6 April 1985.\n523.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos. 1204 and 1275 at its meeting in November 1984, and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see 236th Report of the Committee, paras. 426 to 443 and 444 to 458, approved by the Governing Body at its 238th Session (November 1984)).\n524.The Government representative at the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference (June 1985) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. 1204, 1275 and 1301.\n525.At the 71st Session (Geneva, 1985) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 (both ratified by Paraguay).\n526.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated 20 June 1985 to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n527.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from 23 to 27 September 1985 in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on 21 September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.\n528.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n529.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively 2 and 3 October 1985, presented new allegations in connection with Case No. 1341. These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated 15 October 1985, the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about 30 days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line 21) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated 30 October 1985 in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n530.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.\n531.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.\n532.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from 23 to 27 September 1985 in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos. 1204 and 1341.\n533.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October 1983), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).\n534.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in 1983 the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government\'s position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since 1979 for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.\n535.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government\'s statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions\' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting 27 workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.\n536.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.\n537.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals', '522.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos. 1204 (communications dated 20 and 27 May and 13 and 16 October 1983), 1275 (communication dated 17 April 1984), 1301 (communications dated 6 and 25 September 1984), and 1341 (communication dated 24 June 1985). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No. 1328 in a communication dated 6 April 1985.\n523.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos. 1204 and 1275 at its meeting in November 1984, and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see 236th Report of the Committee, paras. 426 to 443 and 444 to 458, approved by the Governing Body at its 238th Session (November 1984)).\n524.The Government representative at the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference (June 1985) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. 1204, 1275 and 1301.\n525.At the 71st Session (Geneva, 1985) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 (both ratified by Paraguay).\n526.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated 20 June 1985 to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n527.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from 23 to 27 September 1985 in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on 21 September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.\n528.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n529.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively 2 and 3 October 1985, presented new allegations in connection with Case No. 1341. These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated 15 October 1985, the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about 30 days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line 21) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated 30 October 1985 in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n530.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them.
