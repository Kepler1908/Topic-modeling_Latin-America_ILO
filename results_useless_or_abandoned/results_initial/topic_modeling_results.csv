The Committee notes the readiness of the authorities to try to elucidate the allegations, although, according to the Government, many of the events occurred a number of years ago; in some cases the complainants have\nprovided very little information, and in others they have made denunciations to the national authorities.\n287.More specifically, the Committee notes the initiation or continuation of judicial inquiries into the death of the trade unionists Petrolino Hernndez Vasilio (proceedings halted for lack of evidence), Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, Alexnder Giovanni Gmez Virula, Adrin Miranda Prez and Belisario Lpez Rojas, the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vzquez, the abduction of and attacks against Edi Antonio Conde Lu, and the abduction of Ivo Adilio Garca Rivera and Crisanto Garca Alonzo. The\nCommittee observes that, according to the information sent by the Government, the death of Nstor Ren Osorio is not linked to causes of a trade union nature (but to civil problems related to land tenure), and neither is the arrest and prosecution of Otto Ivn Rodrguez Venegas (car theft), nor the alleged attacks against Mr. Ernesto Bol (he was knocked over in a state of drunkenness by a vehicle), nor the arrest of Mr. Cndido Luis Toj (he took part in the lynching of a foreman at the Nueva\nCalifornia farm, who was assassinated). With respect to the imprisonment of Mr. Rubn Terry Amzquita, according to the Government he left the country and went into exile. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more details on the allegation relating to the death of Edwin Giovanni Hidalgo (according to the Government he was neither a worker nor a trade union leader at the National Electrification Institute, and therefore additional information is required to confirm his\ndeath) as well as on other, too general allegations indicated in the annex to this report.\n288.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided information on the remaining allegations of acts of violence against the trade unionists (see the annexed list of pending allegations) and requests it to do so urgently, making sure that judicial inquiries have been initiated, and to keep it informed in this connection.\n289.The Committee observes furthermore that the judicial proceedings brought in relation to acts of violence against trade unionists, to which the Government has referred, do not seem in general to have been concluded nor to have allowed the guilty parties to be identified and punished. In this connection, the Committee stresses that the absence of sentences against the guilty parties involves a de facto impunity which aggravates the climate of violence and insecurity, and that this is extremely\ndetrimental to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee expresses the hope that the  judicial inquiries under way and those that are to be initiated will put an end to the situation of impunity which has existed up until now.\n290.The Committee also requests the Government to send observations on the allegations of the ICFTU (27 June 1996) and of the CLAT (4 October 1996) concerning the assassination of Luis Armando Bravo Prez, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Customs Workers, the attempted assassination of Sixto Prez Coche, Financial Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the La Patria Farm and the following of the trade union leader Jos Antonio Garca by an armed individual. Furthermore, the Committee\nrepeats its request for information on developments in the inquiries relating to the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax, Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar, Camilo Ajqui, to the arrest of trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Roland Pastor and Francisco Pastor, and to the abduction of Walter Njera Molina, who was released.\n291.As regards the pending allegations concerning acts of trade union discrimination, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities denied the request for the reinstatement of a number of members of the Trade Union of the Nueva California farm but that in the case of El Estor the dismissed persons were reinstated in their jobs. The Committee regrets that, according to the Government, the unions at the Medelln, El Trapichito and El Naranjo farms either do not exist or have been inactive for\na considerable amount of time and that at present neither the Trade Union of Bakers of Chiquimula nor the Trade Union of Shipping Workers of the Santo Toms de Castilla Port are operating. Bearing in mind the Government\'s statements and the fact that the acts of discrimination in the cases under consideration occurred a number of years ago, the Committee notes that it will be difficult to reinstate all the dismissed workers. The Committee brings to the Government\'s attention, however, the\nprinciple that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate activities, and it is important to forbid or penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. 696).\n292.The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination that occurred at the International Textile Corporation S.A., El Salto farm, La Mariposa bottling enterprise and the Municipality of Coban, and that it has not provided information on developments in the legal proceedings concerning the dismissal of several trade union leaders of the Workers\' Union of the San Juan de Dios Hospital. The Committee requests the\nGovernment to send information in this connection. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations of anti-union dismissals, violations of the right to collective bargaining and acts of reprisal against unionized workers at the Las Delicias farm. Lastly, the Committee once again appeals to the Government for information on the inquiry which the Office of the Attorney-General was asked to carry out into the alleged surveillance of the IUF premises by persons\nunknown on 23 August 1993.\n293.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) It is with satisfaction that the Committee has learned of the peace agreements and, in particular, of the agreement on the definitive cease-fire (4 December 1996), of the global agreement on human rights and of the agreement concerning socio-economic aspects and agriculture, which establishes the principles of freedom of association, social dialogue,\nnegotiation and consultation. The Committee is certain that civil peace marks the beginning of a new stage in industrial relations. However, the Committee emphasizes that the return to normality in industrial relations must go hand in hand with the elucidation of all the alleged acts of violence agains', 'ed in the dismissal of a captain), the abduction of Walter Njera Molina (who was released), the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vsquez\nLpez and the attacks against Ernesto Bol. However, the Committee deeply regrets that the information supplied by the Government gives no indication that significant progress has been made in the investigations of the numerous cases of alleged violence. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also notes the information from the Government categorically denying the alleged police  repression of strikers at the Social Security Institute on\n11 February 1991 (no force was used and the police presence was confined to guaranteeing freedom to work), and that the detention of officials of the STIGSS during a strike was for a short period and due to the unlawful seizure of vehicles, and that the guilty parties were fined by the magistrates court; the Government also denies that there has been any detention or arrest of trade unionists in the Mahler y Sucesoras enterprise on 12 March 1993 and states that there was only a meeting held\nduring working time and which resulted in the signing of documents in an agreement reached between the parties on the existing labour dispute.\n317.The Committee notes that the Government requests clarification from the complainants on the following allegations: the death of Messrs. Jos Mara Incuyat, Julio Csar Prez and Pedro Genovevo Escobar, the armed attack against Mr. Victor Alfredo Chacoj and the attacks against Werner Coc Ramrez. The Committee therefore requests the complainants to provide the information available to them on these allegations to enable the Government to reply.\n318.As regards the other allegations of deaths, disappearance or acts of violence against trade unionists, although the Committee notes that the Government states in some cases that no denunciations have been made, that the persons concerned were not trade union officials, that the events were not related to the trade union activities or functions of the victims or that the persons concerned have gone into exile abroad, the Committee emphasizes the need to open or continue investigations against\nthose responsible for the offences committed (see the respective list in Annex I). In this respect, the Committee would like to reiterate the conclusions which it reached at its meeting in June 1995 (see 299th Report, paras. 406 and 407), which are reproduced below:The Committee deeply deplores the many violent deaths of trade union officials and trade unionists, as well as the disappearances, abductions, arbitrary arrests, acts of aggression and death threats which have occurred since the\npresentation of the complaints (1990), and expresses its deep concern at the situation of impunity (only in one of the assassinations to which the Government refers does it appear that the authors have been identified) and insists on the absolute need to open judicial inquiries on all the cases before the Committee with a view to ascertaining the facts and punishing the guilty parties. In this connection, the Committee recalls the commitment made by the Attorney-General of the Republic to open\ninquiries on all the cases placed before the Committee and asks the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Although it is aware of the difficult situation affecting Guatemala and of the Government\'s policy for the promotion of human rights, the Committee recalls that ""the rights of workers\' and employers\' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against these organizations\' leaders and members and that it is for\ngovernments to ensure that this principle is respected"" (see 291st Report, Case No. 1700 (Nicaragua), para. 310, and 294th Report, Case No. 1761  (Colombia), para. 726). Furthermore, in the event of assaults on the physical or moral integrity (death threats) of individuals, the Committee believes that steps should be taken immediately to ""institute an independent judicial inquiry with a view to clarifying the facts, determining responsibility, punishing those responsible and preventing the\nrepetition of such acts"" (see 268th Report, Case No. 1341 (Paraguay), para. 378(e)). When judicial investigations into the murder and disappearance of trade unionists have not been successful the Committee considers it indispensable that measures be taken to identify, bring to trial and convict the guilty parties and points out that such a situation means that serious violations of trade union rights may occur in conditions of impunity for the guilty parties, which reinforces the climate of\nviolence and insecurity and thus has an extremely damaging effect on the exercise of trade union rights.The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the assassinations, abductions and other allegations mentioned in the additional information from the IUF and the ICFTU in July, October and December 1995 and expresses its deep concern that new allegations have been made of assassinations and acts of violence against trade unionists in 1995.\n319.As concerns the pending allegations with respect to acts of anti-union discrimination and violations of the principle of collective bargaining, the Committee notes that the question of the reinstatement of dismissed workers for trade union reasons was resolved favourably in the La Patria farm, the Bolivia farm and also with respect to the unionist Ernesto Bol. Noting that the alleged acts of discrimination in the MK S.A., L&L S.A., Unicasa S.A., Welly S.A. and El Salto farm have been\nsubmitted to the judicial authority, the Committee regrets that these questions have not yet been resolved and hopes that the court judgements will rectify all proven anti-union discrimination. The Committee also notes that there have not been any denunciations of discriminatory acts in the La Argentina farm. As concerns the alleged practices contrary to collective bargaining, the Committee notes that, thanks to the intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate, a collective agreement has been\nmade at the Los Angeles farm and that the Government reiterates that the National Committee for the Blind and Deaf Mutes of Guatemala\'s refusal to negotiate and the questions concerning the Autonomous Sports Confederation of Guatemala have been submitted to the judicial authorities. The Committee regrets to note that the Government has not sent information on some of the pending allegations concerning acts of anti-union discrimination, and therefore reiterates the recommendations which it made\nin this regard at its meeting of June 1995 (see 299th Report, para. 427(f), (g) and (j)). Finally, the Committee observes that the complainants have not provided the information requested on the allegations concerning dismissals in the Diseos y Maquilas S.A. enterprise and that the Government has recently indicated that the industrial di', 'ecalls the commitment made by the Attorney-General of the Republic to open investigations on all the cases presented to the Committee and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee expresses its deep concern that new allegations have been made concerning assassinations and acts of violence\nagainst trade unionists in 1995.(b) Although it takes notes of the efforts by the Government to provide information on the alleged deaths and other acts of violence, the Committee urges it to continue sending information on the investigations mentioned in its conclusions and on those concerning the list of allegations appearing in the annex and to take the necessary measures to determine the whereabouts of those who have disappeared. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations\non the additional information presented by the IUF and the ICFTU in their communications of July, October and December 1995.(c) The Committee requests the complainants to provide details on the allegations concerning the death of the trade unionists Jos Mara Incuyat, Julio Csar Prez and Pedro Genovevo, the armed attack against the trade unionist Victor Alfredo Chacoj and the attacks against Werner Coc Ramrez.(d) Regretting that the Government has not provided the information requested on\nsome of the allegations pending concerning, inter alia, acts of anti-union discrimination, the Committee reiterates the recommendations which it made in this regard at its meeting in June 1995 and which are reproduced below:- The Committee asks the Government to provide information on the dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination (indicating the steps taken by the national authorities) in the following enterprises or institutions: International Textile Corporation S.A., Nueva\nCalifornia farm, El Salto farm, Medellin farm, Municipality of El Estor, La Mariposa bottling enterprise, Municipality of Coban, and COCAPSA.- The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation into the alleged anti-union dismissals at the El Trapichito and El Naranjo farms and, should these dismissals be related to legitimate trade union activities, to ensure that the workers concerned are reinstated in their posts. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.\nThe Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the decisions handed down in the legal proceedings concerning the dismissal of several trade union leaders of the Workers\' Union of the San Juan de Dios Hospital and in the  administrative procedures concerning the dismissal of the Secretary-General of the Trade Union of Bakers of Chiquimula, the dismissal of 20 members of the Trade Union of Shipping Workers of Santo Toms de Castilla.- Noting that the Government states, as\nregards the alleged surveillance of the IUF premises by persons unknown on 23 August 1993, that it has requested an inquiry be carried out by the Office of the Attorney-General, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.\n398.In its 295th Report (November 1994, approved by the Governing Body at its 261st Session), the Committee asked the Government to accept a direct contacts mission concerning Cases Nos. 1512, 1539, 1595, 1778 and 1786 to enable it to obtain the necessary information and be able to examine the allegations in full knowledge of all the facts (see 295th Report, paragraph 12). In the same way, the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government for it to transmit its observations on Case No.\n1740 as a matter of urgency (see 295th Report, paragraph 13); the gathering of information on this case would  logically also be one of the objectives of the above-mentioned direct contacts mission.\n399.The Government of Guatemala accepted the direct contacts mission in a communication dated 9 December 1994. The mission took place between 13 and 17 February 1995 and was headed by Mr. Enrique Marin Quijada, a professor of labour law at the Central University of Venezuela (see the mission report in Annex II).\n400.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n401.Since the report of the direct contacts mission contains a summary of theallegations made in the six cases, the replies by the Government to some ofthese and the conclusions of the Committee in its previous examinations ofCases Nos. 1512, 1539 and 1595, the Committee will proceed directly to theformulation of its conclusions, although it will not be able to take intoaccount in its examination of the cases the recent extensive communication ofthe Government dated 16 May 1995 containing\ninformation on the alleged acts ofviolence against unionists (whether or not there were denunciations, cases inwhich further information was requested, cases for which investigations hadbeen set up, etc.).\n427.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee takes note of the report of Professor Enrique Marin on the direct contacts mission which he carried out in Guatemala between 13 and 17 February 1995 and thanks him for his report, and expresses its gratitude to the authorities and the social partners for their full cooperation.(b) The Committee deeply regrets the many violent deaths of trade\nunion officials and trade unionists, as well as the disappearances, abductions, arbitrary arrests, assaults and death threats which have occurred since the presentation of the complaints (1990), expresses its deep concern at the situation of impunity (only in one of the assassinations to which the Government refers do the authors seem to have been identified) and insists on the absolute need for judicial inquiries to be opened on all cases pending before the Committee with a view to clarifying\nthe facts and punishing the guilty parties. In this respect, the Committee recalls the commitment made by the Attorney General of the Republic to open investigations on all the cases presented to the Committee and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) Regretting that it has not received all the information requested from the Government concerning the violent deaths and other alleged acts of violence, the Committee urges it to reply as a matter of urgency to the list of\nallegations contained in Annex I and to take the necessary measures to guarantee the safety of trade unionists under threat of death and to determine the whereabouts of those who have disappeared. The Committee proposes to examine the Government\'s communication of 16 May 1995, which contains additional information on the alleged acts of violence, at its next meeting.(d) Although it takes note that ""the mission had reason to believe that in fact the Ministry of Labour had indeed endeavoured to\nreduce the number of stages ']"

SITET presented additional information on 23 April 1974. The Government submitted its comments by letters dated 5 November and 10 December 1974.\n26.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n27.The CCTD states that during the 58th Session of the International Labour Conference (1973) the Workers\' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body\nwhose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.\n28.SITET states in its letter of 15 March 1974 that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate\na collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.\n29.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April 1971, but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having\nreceived two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE\'s attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.\n30.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to\narbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years\' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of\nthe strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article 334 of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.\n31.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled. The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had\nenabled management to induce 1,100 members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such\ncases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker\'s letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied\nin the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.\n32.The second communication from SITET concerns another practice of the same type: it claims that the chief of the personnel office ceased deducting the trade union dues of some workers, whereas the union had merely asked him to suspend the loan repayments to one of the union\'s bodies.\n33.The Government replied by two communications of 5 November and 10 December 1974. Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section 61 of the Constitution and Sections 364, 366, 368 and 369 of the Labour Code. Section 368 specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section 369 defines as public services\nall activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private f', '25.The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated 13 August 1973; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated 15 March 1974. SITET presented additional information on 23 April 1974.

The Government supplied its observations in letters dated 13 and 22 September 1982.\n197.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n198.Since all the complaints presented by the ICFTU relate to alleged violations of the right of assembly, the Committee has decided to examine the three cases jointly.\n199.In a telegram dated 13 April 1982 (Case No. 1126), the ICFTU states that a national consultative meeting which the National Trade Union Coordinating Committee had planned to hold on 16, 17 and 18 April 1982 at Punta de Tralca for the purpose of discussing trade union and social matters was prohibited by the Chilean authorities.\n200.Another telegram from the ICFTU of 10 May 1982 (Case No. 1137) states that the authorities forcibly prevented the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee from holding a trade union meeting on 7 May 1982.\n201.Lastly, in a letter of 18 May 1982 (Case No. 1136), the ICFTU refers to a meeting of Chilean trade union leaders organised by the National Association of Public Service Employees (ANEF) on 7 May 1982 at the Association\'s headquarters. According to the ICFTU, all of the country\'s political circles were aware of this meeting, and the leaders of legally constituted occupational organisations and trade unions intended to be present. The purpose of the meeting, the ICFTU states, was to attempt to\nunify Chilean social forces in seeking solutions to the serious social and economic problems affecting most of the country\'s population.\n202.On 7 May 1982, the Ministry of Justice, exercising the powers conferred on it by legislative Decrees Nos. 1183 of 1975, 2544 of 1979 and 3346 of 1980 and section 36 of Presidential Decree No. 110 of 1979, notified the ANEF leaders that it was not possible to hold the meeting scheduled. On the same day, officials of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Labour, accompanied by members of the police force, went to the ANEF headquarters to announce that the meeting was prohibited.\n203.The ICFTU considers that these prohibitions constitute interference in the activities of trade union organisations and a violation of Convention No. 87 and of the rights of assembly and expression.\n204.Regarding the consultative meeting which the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee wished to organise on 16, 17 and 18 April 1982 at Punta de Tralca, the Government states, in its communication of 13 September 1962, that the authorities did not prohibit or prevent that meeting. It was the organisers themselves who decided to call it off.\n205.Regarding the meeting of the National Trade Union Coordinating Committee scheduled for 7 May 1982, the Government states that the authorities responsible for ensuring law and order were not aware that that meeting had been prohibited. It is not true that a meeting of that body was prevented by force. The National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee held a meeting on 7 July 1982, which was reported by several broadcasting stations. The Government states that the National Trade Union Co-\nordinating Committee is a de facto body and as such is not entitled to represent workers.\n206.Concerning the prohibition of the ANEF meeting, the Government explains, first of all, that this organisation obtained legal personality under Presidential Decree No. 2161 of the Ministry of Justice dated 28 July 1964, pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code (Title XXXIII of Book I). Its activities are governed by Supreme Decree No. 110 of 1979 concerning private law associations and foundations.\n207.The Government goes on to say that the ANEF therefore is a non-profit-making association governed by private law whose sole purpose, according to article 2 of its by-laws, is ""the administrative, technical and cultural guidance and advancement of its members and the promotion of their social welfare"". According to article 3 of the by-laws, ""the ANEF\'s action shall be carried out in the social and cultural field and may not interfere directly or indirectly in political, religious or trade\nunion activities"". This prohibition, moreover, is provided for in section 6 of Decree No. 110 which provides that such associations may not pursue trade union or profit-making aims.\n208.The Government therefore regards the ANEF as a private law, mutualist association intended for improving the cultural level of its members, different from any other type of organisation governed by a legal status of its own, as is the case of trade union organisations.\n209.The Ministry of justice is responsible for supervising private law associations and foundations. In accordance with section 25 of Decree No. 110, such organisations must not be contrary to law, public order or morality and must pursue the aims for which they were established without infringing their by-laws. If such an organisation changes its statutory purposes or carries on activities contrary to law, public order or morality; the President of the Republic may withdraw its legal\npersonality under section 25 of Decree No. 110 and section 559 of the civil Code.\n210.In the present case, the association in question seriously infringed its by-laws, the Civil Code and Decree No. 110 by calling a trade union meeting. In these circumstances, the Ministry of Justice would normally have had to enforce the law and proceed to annulling the ANEF\'s legal personality. However, it chose instead to notify it that the meeting scheduled could not be held and thus to prevent a wholly irregular situation contrary to the purposes and aims of the association and in\nviolation of existing legislation and regulations.\n211.As for the complainant\'s allegation that Convention No. 87 has been violated, the Government recalls that it has not ratified that instrument and consequently cannot infringe a Convention which is not binding upon it. Paragraph 1 of Article 15 of the Convention provides that the Convention is binding only upon Members whose ratifications have been registered, and paragraph 3 of the same Article provides that it will come into force 12 months after the date on which its ratification has been\nregistered.\n212.Before dealing with the substance of the case, the Committee considers it worth while to answer the objections raised by the Government on the ground that it has not ratified Convention No. 87. While fully aware that the Convention, consequently, is not binding on Chile, the Committee must recall that this country, on becoming a member of the ILO, undertook to respect certain principles, including the principle of freedom of association. As stated by the Committee, ""the function of the\nInternational labour Organisation in regard to trade union ']"

Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to\neliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, 1996, para. 81]. The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that this principle is fully respected.\n280.As regards the allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination and intimidation (including a case of sexual harassment against one female trade union member, dismissals and attempts to put pressure on trade union members to leave their jobs) at the company Ace International S.A., the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that following wide-ranging inquiries by the General Labour Inspectorate, the available administrative proceedings were declared to be exhausted and the\nparties initiated judicial proceedings. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to communicate the results of the administrative investigation, and expresses the hope that the judicial authorities will rule on the very serious allegations in this case, dating from 1999, in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to supply a copy of any judicial ruling as soon as it is handed down.\n281.As regards the detention and indictment on charges of robbery of the labour and disputes secretary at the Mara de Lourdes Farm, Mr. Mota, and the refusal by the farm representatives to sign the judicial ruling acquitting him, the Committee notes the Government s information to the effect that the employer s refusal to sign the ruling does not affect it in any way, and that the aggrieved workers (including Mr. Mota) obtained a settlement with the police accused of illegally detaining them.\nUnder these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.\n282.As regards the allegation that the authorities in the Tecn Umn municipality in San Marcos refused to negotiate a collective agreement, the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: (1) in order to avoid discussion on the draft collective agreement, the authorities convened a community meeting during which the participants rejected any discussion of said collective agreement; (2) the philosophy behind the institution of the community meeting is that of giving greater\npower to the municipal authorities, by broadening political participation by citizens, but on this occasion unfortunately it was used in a way contrary to labour law; (3) the Ministry of Labour instructed the General Labour Inspectorate to carry out visits to the municipal authorities, to which the workers' delegates were refused admission, with a view to resolving the problem of negotiating the collective agreement; and (4) for reasons connected with the autonomy of the local authorities, the\nGeneral Labour Inspectorate has intervened only in a conciliation and advisory capacity, as permitted under labour law. In this regard, the Committee notes that a  community meeting' held in order to avoid negotiating a collective agreement does not stimulate or encourage the full development and application of voluntary bargaining procedures aimed at regulating conditions of employment through collective agreements, as provided for in Convention No. 98 which has been ratified by Guatemala.\nUnder these circumstances the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the authorities in Tecn Umn, San Marcos and the trade union of that municipality negotiate the collective labour agreement in good faith and do everything possible to reach an agreement.\n283.As regards the allegation concerning the closure of Cardiz S.A. following the establishment of a trade union, and the unlawful imprisonment of workers who had remained on company premises in order to prevent the removal of machinery and equipment, the Committee notes the Government s statement that this case was examined by the Tripartite Committee on International Labour Issues which appointed a special commission of inquiry and conciliation, and that the commission had failed to come to\nany agreement because the company representatives had said that they were unable to pay the benefits and wages owed to the workers. In this respect, the Committee notes that the allegations go beyond the payment of wages and therefore requests the Government to take steps immediately to begin an inquiry covering all the allegations and to communicate all the necessary information it may receive during such an investigation.\n284.Lastly, the Committee greatly regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations on certain allegations that had remained pending or on the new allegations presented in Case No. 2050. Under these circumstances, the Committee strongly reiterates its previous recommendations that the Government should: (1) take steps as a matter of urgency to carry out a judicial investigation into the death threats made against the trade unionist Jos Luis Menda Flores, to ensure that he has\nbeen reinstated in his post in accordance with the court ruling, and to keep the Committee informed in this regard; and (2) strongly insists that the Government ensure compliance with the court orders to reinstate the workers dismissed at the company La Exacta and send its observations promptly on the alleged delays in the investigation into the murders in 1994 of four rural workers who had tried to form a trade union; the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of\nthe judicial proceedings under way in respect of these murders and insists that the guilty parties will be punished. The Committee stresses that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest, op. cit., para. 56].\n285.The Committee also requests the Government to communicate its observations in relation to the following allegations: (1) at the Mara de Lourdes Farm, the impossibility of registering trade union officers and the death threats made against the union s general secretary Mr. Otto Rolando Sacuqui Garca; (2) in the municipality of Tecn Umn, the death threats made against the union s secretary for the settlement of disputes, Mr. Walter Oswaldo Apen Ruiz, and his family, to force him to\nrelinquish his job; and (3) in the Hidrotecnica S.A. enterprise, the dismissal of the founders of the union established in 1997.\n286.The Committee notes that the ICFTU has recently presented new allegations (18 October 2001) and requests the Government to forward urgently its observations in this regard.\n287.In view of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take immediate and effective steps to ensure that the three trade unionists who were given new jobs at the Tamport S.A. company after being dismissed for anti-union reasons ar"", 't verifying anti-union activities in the enterprise and in the registration of new executive committees; hiring by the enterprise, as a labour cooperative\nof workers that it had dismissed.\n457.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissals and disciplinary measures against members of the National Union of Bavaria S.A. Workers (SINALTRABAVARIA) for having participated in the strike of 31 August 1999, the Committee expresses its firm hope that the Government will take all possible measures to ensure that all workers and trade union officials who were\ndismissed and disciplined as a result of this strike will, as soon as possible, have their cases dealt with in the labour courts, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) With regard to the allegations presented by SINALTRABAVARIA concerning intimidation of workers to make them sign a collective agreement and preventing the union from entering the premises to advise workers in that connection, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure\nthat the trade union organization can negotiate freely and that workers are not intimidated into signing a collective agreement against their will and without the advice from the trade union organization to which they belong. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) With regard to non-compliance with the collective agreement by the Bavaria S.A. enterprise, which gave rise to resolutions Nos. 2553 and 2554 of 19 November 2002 in favour of the enterprise, the\nCommittee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeals against these.(d) With regard to the untimely closure of enterprises, the dismissal of many officers and members of various branches and pressure to accept a voluntary retirement scheme, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation to determine whether the retirements were in effect voluntary or whether pressure was brought to bear on the workers, and to keep it informed in this respect.(e)\nThe Committee requests SINALTRABAVARIA to provide the list of trade union members to the enterprise so as to ensure that the deduction of trade union dues is carried out without delay.(f) With regard to the complainant organization not attending hearings called by the Ministry of Labour, the Committee considers that whenever the complainant organizations abandon the administrative claims they have filed, the administrative authority should refrain from issuing resolutions in this respect. The\nCommittee requests the Government to ensure that notification of hearings in the framework of the administrative proceedings in progress, take place expeditiously within the legal time limits.(g) With regard to the mass dismissals due to the conversion of the Caja de Crdito Agrario into the Banco de Crdito Agrario, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal action begun by the workers to obtain compensation for dismissal following the closure of the Caja de Crdito\nAgrario and expresses its firm hope that, as this is an issue of labour debt, these claims will be examined as quickly as possible.(h) As regards the dismissal of trade union officers due to failure to recognize their trade union immunity and failure to comply with the orders for reinstatement of some of those officers by the Caja de Crdito Agrario, taking into account that the legal rulings ordered reinstatement and according to the Government this is impossible, the Committee requests the\nGovernment to take steps to find a solution that can be agreed upon by the administration and the trade union officers in question, which might consist of compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(i) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that USITAC, SINALTRAINBEC and UNITAS are registered in the trade union registry without delay as soon as the legal requirements are complied with and to keep it informed in this respect.(j)\nWith regard to the dismissals of trade union officers and members who enjoyed trade union immunity in their capacity as founders and other trade union members as a result of the creation of USITAC, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an investigation in this regard is carried out and, if it is confirmed that these dismissals occurred as a result of anti-union discrimination, that it immediately ensure the reinstatement of the workers affected and, if\nthe reinstatement is not possible, that they be fully compensated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(k) As regards the closing of the Colenvases plant, which led to the dismissal of 42 workers, and of seven trade union leaders in violation of their trade union preferential rights, and in violation of the labour ministry resolution authorizing said closing provided that clauses 14 and 51 of the collective agreement were applied, the Committee requests the\nGovernment to provide a copy of the relevant court decisions as soon as they are issued.(l) With regard to allegations relating to administrative sanctions imposed on the workers of SINALTRABAVARIA, the Committee requests the Government to take measures for the holding of an independent investigation to determine whether the internal work rules have been applied uniformly to all workers regardless of whether or not the workers are unionized, and to keep it informed in this respect.(m) With\nregard to the allegations relating to dismissals presented by SINALTRAINBEC and the allegations of anti-union discrimination presented by SINALTRABAVARIA: disciplinary measures against workers and pressure on them to resign from their trade unions; denial of trade union leave and access of trade union officials belonging to SINALTRABAVARIA to workplaces; delay on the part of the Ministry of Labour to carry out labour inspections to confirm anti-union activity in the enterprise and in the\nregistration of new executive committees; hiring by the enterprise, as a labour cooperative of workers that it had dismissed. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay so that it may examine the case in full possession of the facts\n507.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting of March 2002 [see 327th Report, paras. 412-438, approved by the Governing Body at its 283rd Session (March 2002)]. The National Union of Bavaria S.A. Workers (SINALTRABAVARIA) submitted new allegations in communications of 12 June, 27 September and 16 December 2002. The Colombian Union of Beverage Industry Workers (SINALTRAINBEC) submitted new allegations dated 11 April, 15 August and 21 October 2002.\n508.The Government sent its observations in communications of 15 February, 9 April, 31 May, 10 July, 19 Nove', 's respect.(c) Regretting that it has not received all the information requested from the Government concerning the violent deaths and other alleged acts of violence, the Committee urges it to reply as a matter of urgency to the list of\nallegations contained in Annex I and to take the necessary measures to guarantee the safety of trade unionists under threat of death and to determine the whereabouts of those who have disappeared. The Committee proposes to examine the Government\'s communication of 16 May 1995, which contains additional information on the alleged acts of violence, at its next meeting.(d) Although it takes note that ""the mission had reason to believe that in fact the Ministry of Labour had indeed endeavoured to\nreduce the number of stages and time of the procedure for the establishments of trade unions"", the Committee believes that it would be appropriate to go further in this direction and requests the Government to take measures to this end within its current policy for the promotion of trade union organization.(e) Believing that the judicial procedure should be amended to speed it up and make it more effective and that the number of labour and social welfare courts and conciliation and arbitration\ncourts should be increased, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation in this respect.(f) The Committee asks the Government to provide information on the dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination (indicating the steps taken by the national authorities) in the following enterprises or institutions: International Textile Corporation SA, M.K. SA, L&L SA, Unicasa SA, Welly SA, Nueva California farm, El Salto farm, Bolivia farm, Medellin farm,\nMunicipality of El Estor, La Mariposa bottling enterprise, Municipality of Coban, La Argentina farm, COCAPSA and Agropecuaria Los Angeles SA.(g) The Committee repeats its previous recommendations on some of the dismissals:noting with interest the Government\'s statement that the Union of Peasant Workers of the La Patria farm and the enterprise have reached an agreement on the reinstatement of the dismissed workers in their jobs, the Committee requests the Government to transmit a copy of that\nagreement and to indicate whether these workers were indeed reinstated in their jobs (...). The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation into the alleged anti-union dismissals at the El Trapichito and El Naranjo farms and, should these dismissals be related to legitimate trade union activities, to ensure that the workers concerned are reinstated in their posts. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee once again requests the Government to\nkeep it informed of the decisions handed down in the legal proceedings concerning the dismissal of several trade union leaders of the Workers\' Union of the San Juan de Dios Hospital and in the administrative procedures concerning the dismissal of the Secretary-General of the Trade Union of Bakers of Chiquimula, the dismissal of 20 members of the Trade Union of Shipping Workers of Santo Tomas de Castilla.(h) The Committee asks the Government in all the cases in which there have been anti-trade\nunion dismissals, and irrespective of whether judicial proceedings have or have not been taken, to take as rapidly as possible the necessary measures to enable the trade union officials and members who have been dismissed because of their legitimate trade union activities to be reinstated in their workplaces and to apply the corresponding legal sanctions against the enterprises.(i) The Committee requests the complainants to provide the details requested by the Government concerning the\ndismissals in Disenos y Maquilas SA.(j) Noting that the Government states, as regards the alleged surveillance of the UITA premises by persons unknown on 23 August 1993, that it has requested an inquiry be carried out by the Office of the Attorney General, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(k) Noting that the allegations concerning collective bargaining by the management of the National Committee for the Blind and Deaf Mutes of Guatemala and the Autonomous\nSports Confederation of Guatemala are now before the judicial authorities, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these judicial proceedings.(l) The Committee suggests that the Government and the social partners set up a national tripartite committee. The Committee also encourages the initiatives taken in particular to provide a more satisfactory reply to the allegations concerning freedom of association.(m) The Committee urges the Government to ensure the\nfulfilment of all the commitments which the authorities made to the mission.(n) The Committee recalls that ILO technical assistance is available to the Government with respect to all these matters.\n706.The Committee has examined these cases on a number of occasions, the last being at its November 1991 meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (279th Report of the Committee, paras. 642 to 664, approved by the Governing Body at its 251st Session (November 1991)). In communications dated 17 December 1991 and 22 April 1992, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) made new allegations. In a\ncommunication of 31 July 1992 the Guatemalan Education Workers\' Trade Union (STEG) provided information requested by the Committee. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated 9 September 1992.\n707.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n708.The complainants\' allegations that remained pending concern the requests for information on inquiries into murders, death threats and other serious  forms of intimidation against trade union officials and on anti-union discrimination practices against strikers.\n709.At its November 1991 Session, the Governing Body approved the following interim recommendations of the Committee:- as regards the murders of Jos Orlando Pantalen, Jos Len Segura de la Cruz and Carlos Humberto Rivera, the Committee notes that proceedings have been initiated to establish the facts surrounding these cases and requests the Government to provide information on their outcome;- as regards the allegations of death threats and other serious forms of intimidation against STEG\nleaders, in particular against the General Secretary, Mr. Werner Miranda Caldern, and another member of the trade union who was allegedly abducted and subjected to inhumane treatment by members of the secret police, the Committee notes that the Government has failed to send any reply. The Committee invites the Government to adopt suitable measures as soon as possible so as to prevent any kind of threat of psychological intimidation a']"

Moreover, at its November 1985 meeting,\nthe Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No. 1307 (see 241st Report, para. 749). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No. 1268 was still pending before the Committee (see 234th Report, para. 384).\n420.At the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, 1985) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country\'s legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.\n421.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated 29 November 1985, agreed that the mission should take place from 7 to 11 January  1986.\n422.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the\nrepresentative of the Director-General during the mission.\n423.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H. Nez, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and with senior officials of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the employers\' and workers\' organisations.\n424.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n425.The Committee wishes first of all to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission and for his detailed report on the pending cases, which made it possible for the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n426.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n427.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from 7 to 11 January 1986.   The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.   In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders\nreferred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.\n428.When the Committee considered this case at its May 1985 meeting (see  239th Report, paras. 243-258) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants\' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest\ndevelopments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers\' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS).   The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered\nthat since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated 11 October 1985, presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers\' Union, who was reported by the\nICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the 105th Infantry Brigade.\n429.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on 28 March 1983 against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.\n430.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: (1) of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not\nguilty of criminal liability;  (2) those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; (3) Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.\n431.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.\n432.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the  facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. In', '419.The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May 1985, in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos. 1216 and 1271) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No. 1216 (see 239th Report of the Committee, para. 258), and in order that the various aspects of Case No. 1271 might be fully examined (see 239th Report, para. 275) . Moreover, at its November 1985 meeting,\nthe Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No. 1307 (see 241st Report, para. 749). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No. 1268 was still pending before the Committee (see 234th Report, para. 384).\n420.At the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, 1985) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country\'s legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.\n421.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated 29 November 1985, agreed that the mission should take place from 7 to 11 January  1986.\n422.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the\nrepresentative of the Director-General during the mission.\n423.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H. Nez, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and with senior officials of the Ministry, as well as representatives of the employers\' and workers\' organisations.\n424.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n425.The Committee wishes first of all to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission and for his detailed report on the pending cases, which made it possible for the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General shows how useful missions of this kind are in elucidating the matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n426.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee may proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n427.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission to Honduras from 7 to 11 January 1986.   The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.   In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders\nreferred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.\n428.When the Committee considered this case at its May 1985 meeting (see  239th Report, paras. 243-258) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants\' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest\ndevelopments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers\' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS).   The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered\nthat since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated 11 October 1985, presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers\' Union, who was reported by the\nICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the 105th Infantry Brigade.\n429.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on 28 March 1983 against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.\n430.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: (1) of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not\nguilty of criminal liability;  (2) those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; (3) Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.\n431.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (particularly, Mr. Jaime Echeverra) in the murders, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities have released these persons since there were no grounds for their continued detention.\n432.Whenever allegations concerning the death or serious injury of trade union leaders or unionists have been submitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the  facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. In', '419.The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May 1985, in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos. 1216 and 1271) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No. 1216 (see 239th Report of the Committee, para. 258), and in order that the various aspects of Case No. 1271 might be fully examined (see 239th Report, para. 275) . Moreover, at its November 1985 meeting,\nthe Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No. 1307 (see 241st Report, para. 749). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No. 1268 was still pending before the Committee (see 234th Report, para. 384).\n420.At the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, 1985) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country\'s legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.\n421.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated 29 November 1985, agreed that the mission should take place from 7 to 11 January  1986.\n422.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the\nrepresentative of the Director-General during the mission.\n423.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H.

(See the Committee's 288th  Report, paras. 8 and 35(f) and (g).)\n230.Following contacts at the Conference, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare agreed to the direct contacts mission.\n231.In addition, the IFCTU submitted new allegations in the context of Case No. 1441 in a communication of 28 June 1993 (see the attached summary in the direct contacts mission report, para. 13).\n232.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Professor Jos Vida Soria, Professor of Labour Law at the University of Grenada, and President of the Committee of Experts of the European Social Charter, to carry out the direct contacts mission, assisted by a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO. The mission took place from 27 September to 1 October 1993.\n233.The Committee notes that the mission met with Dr. Juan Sifontes, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Dr. Carlos Mauricio Molina, Attorney-General for Human Rights, Dr. Estela Avila, Chief of the International Relations Office of the Ministry of Labour, as well as with representatives of Interoccupational Coordination (UNTS, UNOC, AGEPYM, CGT, FESINCONSTRAM, CTS, etc.) and of the National Association of Private Enterprise (NAPE).  It also met with Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, Chief of the\nUnited Nations Observer Mission (ONUSAL) and with several senior officials from ONUSAL.  The Committee also notes that the government authorities and the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations collaborated closely with the mission, and that government authorities gave every assistance.\n234.The Committee has also noted Professor Jos Vida Soria's mission report (see Annex I), as well as the Government's observations addressed to the Committee and to the mission concerning outstanding allegations.\n235.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No. 87), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n236.In as much as the direct contacts mission report contained in the Annex summarizes not only the substance of outstanding allegations, but also the Committee's previous conclusions and recommendations, as well as the Government's observations and the new allegations, the Committee proceeds directly to its conclusions and recommendations.\n246.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)   The Committee notes with interest the improvement in various important aspects of the trade union situation and, especially, the decline in violence to a point, where - according to the mission report - in the last 12 months there have only been isolated acts of violence against trade unionists although threats have been made in certain cases.(b)\nNotwithstanding the current improvements in the situation, the Committee deplores once again the numerous and serious acts of violence to which the trade union movement and their leaders       have been subjected in recent years and which have often resulted in loss of life or the violation of the most       fundamental human and trade union rights.  The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that such events are never repeated.  The Committee calls on the Government to keep it\ninformed of developments in the judicial investigations into       the various cases of trade unionists being murdered or       assaulted, or who disappeared in recent years.  In the Committee's opinion, the absence of judgements against the       guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity,       which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union       rights.(c)   Regarding the arrest of trade unionists and\nthreats made       against them in recent years, and while it notes with interest that there are no trade unionists at present under arrest for       trade union activities, the Committee deplores the large number of trade unionists who have been arrested in recent years, the       threats that have been made and the climate of  intimidation in which trade union activity has often taken place;  it hopes that such occurrences, which prevent the normal exercise of trade union rights, will not be\nrepeated in the future.(d)   Bearing in mind the allegations of anti-union discrimination in the cases under examination and that the mission report mentions that trade union organizations have denounced many       such instances, the Committee urges the Government, in its forthcoming revision of the Labour Code and in the future Act respecting industrial relations in the public administration (for which the Government has requested ILO technical assistance), to guarantee adequate protection\nagainst dismissal       and other acts of discrimination for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade       union.(e)   The Committee expresses its strong reprobation and its serious concern with respect to the kidnapping of the six-month-old son of trade unionist Lucas Bernal Mrmol.  The Committee insists       that the Government make vigorous efforts to find the child and to punish the kidnappers and requests it to keep it informed in       this\nregard.(f)   The Committee reminds the Government that the ILO may provide       its help in order to provide information on the contents of the       Conventions on freedom of association with a view to possible ratifications.\n1.The Committee on Freedom of Association, set up by the Governing Body at its 117th Session (November 1951), met at the International Labour Office, Geneva, on 20, 21 and 25 May 1993 under the chairmanship of Mr. Jean-Jacques Oechslin, former Chairman of the Governing Body.\n2.The Committee had before it various complaints of violations of freedom of association in El Salvador, presented by a number of international and national trade union organizations (Cases Nos. 1273, 1441/1494 and 152"", ""228.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. 1273, 1441, 1494 and 1524 on several occasions, most recently at its meeting of May 1993, when it submitted an interim report (see the Committee's 288th Report, paras. 1-35, approved by the Governing Body at its 256th Session (May 1993)), which drew attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February 1991 by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, in spite of the extreme seriousness\nof the allegations, to send the information requested by the Committee.\n229.Consequently, at said meeting the Committee once again urged the Government to send the information requested and to accept the mission in question; it also requested the Director-General of the ILO to contact the representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the next session of the International Labour Conference (June 1993), and to urge the Government to respect fully the Committee's recommendations.
