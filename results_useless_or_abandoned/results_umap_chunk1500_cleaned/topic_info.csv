The Committee observes that, as indicated by the complainant organization, the FTLF, and confirmed by the Government, FONAFE must comply with Act No. , and that as a result, state electrical companies within FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The Committee notes that the complainant organization, the FTLF, attached to its complaint copies of letters sent to FONAFE and to the electrical company, Electrocentro, SA, in which it requested that the th final supplementary provision of Act No.  should not be applied. As is clear from the attachments submitted by the complainant organization, in his reply the FONAFE Executive Director stated that Act No.  restricts collective bargaining and labour arbitration to working conditions only and emphasized that FONAFE must comply with the Act in question; for its part, the company Electrocentro, SA, stated that the Act was the responsibility of FONAFE and that it is not competent to deal with the request to revoke or contravene the content of the th final supplementary provision of Act No. .\n.The Committee wishes to emphasize that it has referred on various occasions to matters relating to collective bargaining in Peruvian legislation applicable to the public sector and that in the past few years it has made recommendations to the Government as part of complaints submitted by Peruvian trade union organizations, very similar to the present cases (Cases Nos  and ). The Committee recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to wage ceilings imposed by FONAFE in the wage scales of public electrical companies. The Committee reiterates its previous conclusions and once again recalls the principle, according to which  in so far as the income of public enterprises and bodies depends on state budgets, it would not be objectionable ' after wide discussion and consultation between the concerned employers' and employees' organizations in a system having the confidence of the parties ' for wage ceilings to be fixed in state budgetary laws' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requested the Government on that occasion  to ensure that trade unions in the public enterprises are consulted when setting budget ceilings for public enterprises with regard to wages, so that the trade unions concerned may assess the situation, express their views and positions and discuss with the authorities the considerations of general interest that these authorities may deem it necessary to highlight' [see th Report, para. ].\n.The Committee also recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to Ministerial Resolution No. --TR which obliges the arbitrators of collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget. The Committee notes that in its last reply the Government referred to the need for collective bargaining to take place within the state budgetary limits. The Committee reiterates its conclusion in Case No. , according to which  the requirement itself for arbitrators to take into account available resources in the public budget is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining'  and again requests the Government to ensure respect for its principles as regards salary restrictions in collective bargaining in the public sector [see Digest, op. cit., paras -] [see th Report, para. ].\n.Furthermore, as regards the civil service reform introduced by Act No. , the Committee notes that the reform applies to State workers at the three levels of government (national, regional and local), and that two draft regulations were issued together with the Act: regulations governing the general application of the Act and regulations covering the special system for local governments. Likewise, the Committee observes that, as is clear from the wording of the Act, staff covered by the old systems (workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (public careers), workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (system based on rules for the private sector) and workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (hired on administrative services contracts)) may be transferred, voluntarily and subject to a merit-based public competition, to the system provided for in the Act. Act No.  states that incorporation in the new system should take place gradually and that it will be finalized within a maximum period of six years.\n.As regards the allegations whereby the process of drafting the Civil Service Act No.  circumvented the mechanism for participation or consultation of workers' organizations, the Committee notes that the Government has not responded to this allegation and therefore recalls in general terms that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate organizations of workers and employers [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Consequently, the Committee firmly expects that in future the Government will guarantee that, in practice, the trade unions participate in the consultations on any question or proposed legislation which affects the rights of the workers it represents.\n.As to the allegations according to which Act No.  infringes the right to strike by allowing public entities to hire, temporarily and directly, the staff necessary to guarantee the provision of minimum services in essential services and in services vital for the entity to operate, from the beginning of the strike until its actual end, the Committee notes that the Government considers that this would not cause problems of compatibility with the ILO Conventions, provided that the requirements established in the Act are satisfied, that is, the services qualified as essential are determined according to the criteria of the ILO supervisory bodies, the minimum services are defined with the participation of workers' organizations, and replacement workers are hired only where the minimum services have not been covered by the organization or workers exercising their right to strike and this situation leads to a serious risk to human life, safety or health. In this regard, the Committee recalls the principle according to which the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited in the public service or in essential services in so far as a strike there could cause serious hardship to the national community and provided that the limitations are accompanied by certain compensatory guarantees [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.As to the allegations that section  of Act No.  excludes public servants, public managers and trusted servants from collective rights, the Committee notes that the Government states that although no such exclusion exists in the strict sense of the term, a rule should be created which specifies the scope for the purposes of clearer interpretation. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article () of Convention No.  states that the extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Convention shall apply to high-level employees whose functions are normally considered as policy-making or managerial, or to employees whose duties are of a highly confidential nature, shall be determined by national laws or regulations. The Committee recalls, however, that under Convention No. , ratified by Peru, the right of collective bargaining can be denied only to public servants working in the state administration.\n.As to the allegations that section  of Act No.  adds major difficulties to the negotiating process given that once the list has been submitted, approval must be obtained from the National Civil Service Authority (SERVIR) and from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the agreements reached between the representatives of the public entity and the civil servants are valid for a minimum of two years, the Committee notes that the Government stresses that the Committee on Freedom of Association has held that  the duration of collective agreements is primarily a matter for the partners involved'  In this regard, the Committee recalls firstly that budgetary opportunities within the negotiating framework may be verified and, secondly, recalls the principle according to which  a statutory provision providing that a collective agreement should be in force for two years when no other period has been agreed by the parties does not constitute a violation of the right to collective bargaining' [see Digest, op. cit. para. ]. Consequently, the Committee will not continue with the examination of these allegations.\n.In relation to the allegation by the complainant organizations that section  of Act No.  circumvents collective bargaining in all public entities to working conditions only, excluding subjects relating"", 'punish those responsible for the numerous acts of violence and to achieve provable results in disbanding the paramilitary and other violent revolutionary groups.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide clear information about the programme of protection for  and expresses the firm hope that this protection will be extended to all workers who are members and officials of trade unions whose personal safety is threatened, including members of ASODEFENSA.(f) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to carry out an unrestricted assessment of the risk run by threatened trade unionists and to provide adequate protection measures.(g) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to send a new consolidated list prepared by the Sub-Committee on the Unification of the List of Victims for the period -.(h) The Committee once again recalls that it would be advisable to deal specifically with situations in which violence against trade union members is very intensive -- for example in the sectors including education, the petroleum industry, the health services as well as municipal and departmental administrations. Such information should also refer to regions where acts of violence occur most frequently, such as the departments of Valle del Cauca and Antioqua and the municipality of Barrancabermeja, especially in the Empresa de Petrleo de Colombia and the Empresa de Gas de Barrancabermeja. The Committee also requests the Government to send all the information available to it which could help better to combat impunity and examine the causes of the acts of violence against trade union members. The Committee once again reminds the Government of its responsibility for the protection of workers against acts of violence and finally for a proper factual and analytical assessment of each and every crime committed. The Committee again suggests that the complainants and the Government seek technical assistance from the Office for this assessment.(i) Regarding the allegations of ASODEFENSA, the Committee reiterates its previous recommendations which are reproduced below:(i) Regarding the allegations of ASODEFENSA relating to: (a) the refusal to grant permission for trade union activities; (b) the prohibition to circulate bulletins, news-sheets and pamphlets containing trade union information, to post trade union information on notice boards, to allow meetings to take place or to speak of trade union matters; (c) the anti-union dismissals, transfers and harassment for belonging to ASODEFENSA of Delfirio Pealosa Ruiz, Fernando Matiz Olaya, Alberi Gonzlez Garca, Luis Abul Manrique, Jos Joaqun Moreno Durn and Jorge Elicer Nez Rodrguez, among others; and (d) the disregard for the trade union immunity of Graciela Martnez and Cenelly Arias Ortiz, the Committee requests the Government to take the steps necessary to ensure that permission for trade union activities is not arbitrarily refused, that workers are guaranteed the right to publish notices and information, put up posters and meet in the workplace, and respect the trade union rights of Ms. Graciela Martnez and Ms. Cenelly Arias Ortiz.(ii) Regarding the refusal to extend protection to trade union offices, trade union officials and their families against threats of violence and death, alleged by ASODEFENSA, the Committee requests the Government promptly to take the necessary steps to guarantee the material security of trade union offices and the physical safety of trade union officials and their families.\n.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) sent new allegations in communications dated  January,  February, ,  and  March, ,  and  April, ,  and  May,  June,  and  October,  November,  and  December  and  January and  February . The Single Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CUT), the Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CTC), the General Confederation of Democratic Workers (CGTD) and the Confederation of Pensioners of Colombia (CPC) sent new allegations in a communication dated  June . The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) sent new allegations in communications dated  and  March, ,  and  July,  August,  and  October, ,  and  November and  December  and  and  January . The Trade Union Association of Civil Servants of the Ministry of Defence, Armed Forces, National Police and Related Bodies (ASODEFENSA) sent new allegations in communications dated  February and  August . The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented a complaint in a communication dated  February . The Latin-American Central of Workers (CLAT) sent new allegations in a communication dated January . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .\n.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations that were still pending which, for the most part, referred to acts of violence against trade union members and various acts directed against trade unions, including acts of anti-union discrimination [see th Report, para. ]:(a) the Committee deeply deplores the resurgence of violence against trade union officials and members stated by the complainants (more than  murders in the year  and two murders, four attempted murders and one disappearance so far for ), and urges the Government in the strongest terms to take immediate steps to initiate inquiries in order to clarify these instances of violence and promptly and fully punish those responsible;(b) the Committee once again deeply regrets that the great majority of cases of murders, attempted murders or disappearances of trade union officials or members has not been brought before the court and that those responsible have not been sanctioned, and that according to the most recent information provided by the Government, this tendency, as in previous years, continues unchanged. The Committee urges the Government to make vigorous efforts against the serious and intolerable situation of impunity and to keep it informed of developments;(c) regarding the initiation of global inquiries at the institutional level into the participation of public officials (especially officials of the armed forces) in the creation of self-defence or paramilitary groups and the passivity, connivance or collaboration of such officials by deed or omission vis--vis these groups and the violation of human rights in general that this entails, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any new inquiries and particularly of the sanctions that are imposed on public officials that have taken part in some way in these acts of violence against trade union officials or members, and emphasizes the need to carry out global inquiries into the conduct of public officials. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information concerning the table which it sent setting out the number of civil servants who have violated human rights given that the parts ""those who have been charged"" and ""those who have been sentenced"" do not contain any numbers for  and  (contrary to the information communicated for ). The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the statistics concerning the civil servants charged with human rights violations for ;(d) regarding the adoption of radical and systematic steps to disband the self-defence groups wherever they operate and to neutralize and punish all their leaders, members and financial backers, the Committee urges the Government to continue its efforts to fight against these groups and requests to be kept informed of the results. The Committee insists that, in the near future, results be achieved in disbanding the paramilitary groups and that those responsible be punished;(e) regarding the convening of a working group of independent representatives accepted by both parties to clarify the enormous divergences in the figures given for trade union officials and members murdered over the past ten years, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the continuation of the work of the subcommission and to forward a list of the  people murdered;(f) regarding the allegations of acts of violence against trade union officials and members (murders, physical aggression and disappearances) that the Government has announced that it is investigating, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the progress and of the outcome of the inquiries currently under way (see annex below).AnnexMurders, attempted murders, physical aggression, disappearances and detentionsMurders() Antonio Moreno Asprilla ( August ); () Manuel Ballesta Alvarez ( August ); () Francisco Mosquera Crdoba ( February ); () Carlos Antonio Arroyo ( February ); () Francisco Antonio Usuga ( February ); () Pedro Luis Bermdez Jaramillo ( June ); () Armando Humanes Petro ( May ); () William Gustavo Jaimes Torres ( August ); () Jaime Elicer Ojeda ( May ); () Alfonso Noguera Cano ( November ); () Alvaro Hoyos Pabn ( December ); () Nstor Eduardo Galndo Rodrguez ( July ); () Erieleth Barn Daza ( May ); () Jhon Freddy Arboleda Aguirre ( July ); () William Alonso Surez Gil ( July ); () Eladio de Jess Chaverra Rodrguez ( July ); () Luis Carlos', 'a legal entity by virtue of its very establishment, as from the date of its constitutent assembly"".\n.As regards infringements of the right of freedom of association, they are defined as criminal acts and punished in accordance with the detailed provisions of section  of Act No.  of . They may also give rise to administrative sanctions. The right to freedom of association is now enshrined in the Constitution; through Act No.  of , the State has established more effective machinery to ensure the prompt settlement of disputes. Furthermore, the Ministry ensures the right to collective bargaining, facilitating the quick settlement of disputes by intervening when requested to do so by the parties, by convening arbitration courts when called for by law, or by imposing the appropriate penalties on enterprises refusing to enter into a dialogue when claims and demands are filed in due form. In  (through June)  new trade union organizations came into existence and  collective agreements were signed. (Source: Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Labour.)\n.As regards the possible revision of the Anti-terrorism Act, the Government points out that such action is reserved for the competent government authorities, and namely the Congress of the Republic.\n.As regards the numerous allegations of acts of violence committed against trade unionists, the Government points out that the cases regarding the following people are currently at various stages of investigation: Hernando Valencia Laso, the Montes Ovalle families, Luis Carlos Prez, Martha Luz Loaiza Valencia, Jairo Sandoval Enciso, Marta Gavalo Rivas, Vctor Vsquez Padilla, Alberto Gmez, Oscar Arias, Omar Ramrez, Jos Ignacio Vargas, AlbeiroLondoo, Jos Omar Patio Rincn, Jos Santo Mendivelso Coconubo, Edgar Poe Foronda, Cicern Ortiz Parada, Alejandro Salazar Paz and others (those murdered at Los Uvos), Julio Daniel Chaparro and Jorge Enrique Torres Navas, Alonso Lara Martnez and Marina Villaborna Forero, Bendicto Cubides Forero and Mara Snchez, Anbal Silvestre and Javier Rengifo, Alvaro Quintero, Guillermo Rojas, Jacobo Beltrn Novoa, Alfredo Parejo Gmez, Rodrigo Navarro Pinto and Robert Valet Fuentes, Martn Arias and Eduardo Arias, Luis Eduardo Tejada and others, Antonio Palacios Urrea and others (those murdered at Fusagasug), Ligia Patricia Corts Colmenares and others, Flix Juvenal Vega Rodelo, Jaime Arturo Marrugo Jaraba, Benancio and Reynaldo Jos Narvez Figueroa, Gabriel Ovidio and others, Jos Ramrez Vergara, Moiss Narvez Gmez, Luis Ramos Toledo, Pablo Len, Daro Vsquez and Fernando Sarmiento, Jess Alirio Guevara Angarita, Aroldo Gallego and others, Oliverio Molina (Jos Oliveros Molina, according to the Special Prosecutor), Mara Elena Ordoez and Arturo Valencia Castillo, Vladimir Hincapi Galeano and Csar Chaparro Navia, Samuel Fernando Roja Mota, Raquel Judith and Jorge Ernesto Bernal Dueas, Humberto Murillo and others, and Emilio Valencia Vallecilla. As regards the allegation of a massacre of  workers on  January  in Barrancabermeja, the Government is certain that this incident did not take place.\n.On the other hand, the Government also reports that the following cases are not included in the Ministry of Labour\'s registry: Luis Eduardo Padilla, Tefilo Carrillo, David Osuna;  July  seven farmworkers murdered by a bomb blast;  January  two workers of the Frontino mines; February  Jess Anbal Angel;  February  the death of three farmworkers in Pechiln and Naranjal; Emeterio Rueda, the leader of FENSUAGRO;  April  the death of four farmworkers in El Floral; trade unionist Gabriel Tapia;  May  the attack on the leader of the farmworkers\' union, Matas Funes;  March  deaths in the Manzana and Flora banana farms;  March  Luz Miriam Pealoza, Soacha; Consuelo Castaeda, Luis Carlos Lozano, Yumbo; Alvaro Roa, Medelln, and Nubia Jimnez and Elisa Impus, Nevia.\n.In its communication of  October  the Government reports that it is investigating the case of Mr. Valencia Lasso Hernando, that the Montes Ovalle family\'s complaints are being investigated by the Special Prosecutor, and that no evidence of harassment has been found.\n.In its communications of  April and  October  the Government reports that the courts have ordered investigations into the murders of Emilio Rueda Ortiz, Heriberto Lpez, Apolinar Fabra, Romn Hernndez and Freddy Enrique Meja, and into the disappearances of Luis Alberto Builes, Alvaro Usuga, Marcial Alonso Gonzlez and Lucio Serrano Luna.\n.In its communication of November  the Government states that, as regards the problem of violence in Colombia and measures being taken to combat it, a plethora of forces contribute to the generalized context of violence in the country. They include widespread social violence, political violence and violence linked to drug trafficking. Among these, according to studies conducted by the CINEP, only  per cent is attributable to political violence. It should be emphasized that the Colombian State is not opposed to trade unionism; on the contrary, the Government has every interest in defending the rights of workers. The problem in the country with respect to this defence is one involving the deinstitutionalization of the handling of disputes between the social partners. On the one hand, some employers, allied with officials of the Administrative Department of Security or officials of other state security organizations, are harassing trade union leaders; they are not, however, doing so with impunity. On the other hand, trade unionists are forging alliances with guerrilla and other forces to harass employers or their agents. The State, which is concerned about this generalized violence and deinstitutionalization, is trying to create an awareness that forces having nothing to do with social and labour questions should not interfere in relations between employers and workers.\n.The Government points out that the first phase of the National Strategy against violence, to which it referred in previous communications, resulted in the following successes: greater leadership of the civilian authorities in ensuring security; a stronger system of justice, a better-equipped law enforcement service and a more effective intelligence service; the State has retaken the initiative against those responsible for violent acts; there are fewer kidnappings in Colombia; there is an open door to dialogue for those who genuinely want peace; and the defence and promotion of human rights are priorities for the Government.\n.The Government is making progress in the second stage of the National Strategy against violence, which aims at a policy to ensure that the citizens are safe and that there is peaceful coexistence. This policy is based on a two-pronged approach: the consolidation of efforts to strengthen the systems of justice and law enforcement, and the strengthening of prevention and security, under the leadership of the national Government, the governors and mayors. Toward that end, the following activities will be conducted with a view to overcoming the insecurity in Colombian society: maintaining efforts to strengthen the systems of justice and law enforcement, as well as continuing to modernize the intelligence services, offering them the latest technologies, placing the highest priority on reforming the national police and modernizing the country\'s penitentiary system; strengthening prevention through comprehensive programmes for those at high-risk; continuing to consolidate the planning of security, justice and defence-related affairs in the country, to draw up policies and find resources within the framework of the National Development Plan; the Government will continue to call upon the community to cooperate with the authorities, conveying the message that the only way to attain greater security is through civil solidarity, with the State and society playing complementary roles.\n.The defence and promotion of human rights have been and remain a priority for the Government. The Government will continue its work of teaching and disseminating the fundamental rules of human rights and will strengthen its monitoring machinery both within and outside public institutions to prevent, investigate and punish any violations. Finally, the Government reports that as regards the death and disappearance of trade unionists in respect of whom it has not provided information, it has communicated their names to the Special Prosecutor and to the Chief Prosecutor with a view to obtaining information on the status of criminal and administrative proceedings under way.\n.As regards the allegations concerning violations of trade union rights at various enterprises, the Government reports the following:- BANK OF CALDAS - NATIONAL FEDERATION OF COFFEE GROWERS: the trade union filed suit in Bogot against the Bank of Caldas for infringement of the right of association. In addition, suits brought before the regular labour court by the workers covered by trade union immunity have to date resulted in various rulings in their favour. Consequently, the enterprise has had to pay the corresponding compensation along with other legal and contractual benefits. There are currently three claims of trade union immunity in the city of Manizales, and another in Armenia, related to this subject. The Ministry of Labour held to the legal position that the request to convene a binding arbitration court should not be granted, as the workers did not observe the requirements laid down in section  of Act No.  of ;- HOLGUIN STEEL GROUP: numerous workers were dismissed as a consequence of the economic crisis affecting the enterprise. The Ministry of Labour fined the enterprise for not having requested the appropriate authorization. The workers later held a work stoppage, which']"

It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.\n.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA. On the contrary, considerable progress had occurred in relation to the previous situation.\n.Firstly, the Government makes a clarification regarding the reference to the national Government (to which the Ministry of Education and Sport belongs) as the employer? For the Government, this assertion is far removed from reality. In this regard, it explains that in the early s legislation adopted by the national Congress (Act No.  and complementary legislation) provided that educational establishments that had hitherto been under the auspices of the national Government would now be directly governed by the provinces. Hence the legislation provided at that time for the transfer to the provinces of educational establishments and their teaching and non-teaching staff that until then had been under national direction. Consequently, from that time onwards no educational establishments, or any of the teachers employed there, were any longer under the control of the national Government. Hence it is incorrect to describe the national Government as the employer? There are  different sets of regulations relating to teaching, each of them applicable in their respective area of jurisdiction. According to the Government, this demonstrates that the central government is not the employer? the employers are the provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each having its respective territory.\n.As regards the framework agreement (provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) and referred to in point  of the collective agreement of February ), the Government indicates that it should not be forgotten that even if reference is made to a framework agreement? what is essential is the existence of agreements between the parties in each province. On that basis, from a position already fixed internally, discussions on the framework agreement can begin with the aim of reaching basic agreements at national level. The Government indicates that section  of Act No.  of January  (implemented by Decree No. /), provides as follows: The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (currently the Ministry of Education and Sport) together with the Federal Council for Culture and Education (currently the Federal Council for Education) and the teaching unions with national representation, shall conclude a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d) the teaching career. The Government explains that: (i) although no meetings were held from  to  for the purposes of formulating the framework agreement established in section of Act No.  ?there were only meetings at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary, which had been fixed by agreement with the unions in some cases, while other meetings had been prescribed by decree of the Executive Authority where there was no agreement ?this inaction ceased as from ; (ii) the foregoing does not alter the fact that it is a complicated, difficult task for the various regional jurisdictions, each having its own regulations relating to teachers, to reach basic agreements in relation to the creation of the framework agreement; and (iii) this whole situation goes far beyond the possibilities of the national Government, which depends on the decisions and policies of the various regional jurisdictions within the countrys federal system.\n.With regard to the minimum teaching salary (point  of the collective agreement of February ), namely the salary threshold below which no province may set the salary of any teacher, the Government explains that reaching agreement at that time on an automatic mechanism for increasing the minimum teaching salary was a significant step forward. The new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions entails the automatic increase of the minimum salary, which is updated each year. This joint agreement establishes that the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board for education. For the Government, the clause regarding the automatic increase makes it unnecessary and merely academic to hold discussions on the minimum teaching salary each year. The automatic increase is calculated on the basis of the minimum living wage. This is fixed annually by the Council for the Minimum Living Wage, with the participation of workers, employers and representatives of the national Government and of the Federal Labour Council (provincial governments). Hence, in addition to the amount established annually as the general minimum wage by this Council, there is an extra  per cent as a fixed component of the minimum teaching salary for the year.\n.With regard to the Compensation Fund referred to in the complaint from the UDA, this is designed to complement (compensate) the earnings of teachers who do not reach the established minimum threshold. The aim is to help iron out disparities in the initial teaching salary in provinces where, despite financial input into the sector and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is not possible to overcome those inequalities. This is separate from the FONID, which, simply providing incentives as its name suggests, has a totally different function from the Compensation Fund.\n.In a communication of March , the Government forwards information provided by the Ministry of Governance, Labour and Justice of the Province of Mendoza regarding the classroom allowance. It states that FLATEC brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court. However, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff. According to the Government, this demonstrates a lack of coherence in that the union renounced any local ruling but decided to pursue the matter at the international level in the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.\n.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.', '.The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated  November  and  May and  October  (Case No. ); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated  February and  April  (Case No. ); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated  April and May  and  February  (Case No. ).\n.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April  and February and March .\n.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos ,  and  will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In a communication of  November , the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of . It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February  have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. .\n.In an additional communication of  May , the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March  in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of  per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by  per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in . As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.\n.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March . As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. /. By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. . The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .\n.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. ///).\n.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March , at the start of the  academic year.\n.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of  March  to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos  and . The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.\n.In its communication dated  February , FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No.  and Decree No.  of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March  for every employee covered by Act No. and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.\n.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.\n.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January  the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No.  concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of', '.The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated  November  and  May and  October  (Case No. ); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated  February and  April  (Case No. ); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated  April and May  and  February  (Case No. ).\n.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April  and February and March .\n.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos ,  and  will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In a communication of  November , the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of .

The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. ///).\n.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March , at the start of the  academic year.\n.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of  March  to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos  and . The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.\n.In its communication dated  February , FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No.  and Decree No.  of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March  for every employee covered by Act No. and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.\n.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.\n.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January  the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No.  concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of']"

Under section , subsection (c), the sudden stoppage of or interference with operations inside or outside the workplace is deemed to be an unjustified non-compliance with obligations and hence punishable by dismissal; and under section  the law enforcement officer on duty or his assistants or the police are responsible for verifying the occupation of premises and for identifying the workers who occupy the premises, for the purpose of their dismissal.\n.In their communications dated  April  and  May , the Federation of Workers in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru and the Federation of Fishermen of Peru stated that on  April the Government, without consulting the parties concerned, promulgated Supreme Decree No. --TR, which provides that, as from  December  - the date of entry into force of Legislative Decree No.  - collective contracts or agreements may not contain systems of automatic adjustment linked to price indexes.\n.The complainants add that under the said decree it is mandatory to replace the systems of automatic wage adjustment by other systems that take into account the improvement of productivity and increase in output of every workplace, for which purpose a strict deadline of six months is prescribed as from the entry into force of the said Legislative Decree No. . Supreme Decree No. --TR not only requires workers to come to terms with their employers on the replacement of the system of calculating wages that had been achieved by means of a collective agreement, but also renders inoperative collective agreements as from  December , the date on which Legislative Decree No.  entered into force, which constitutes a breach of specific ILO Conventions.\n.In addition, in its communication of  June  the Federation of Fishermen refers to the promulgation of Legislative Decree No.  which, inter alia, declares inoperative all collective agreements that contain: clauses providing for the automatic adjustment of wages in the light of the fluctuation of prices; clauses providing for the adjustment of wages in the light of the value of foreign currency; and clauses providing for the adjustment of wages by a method analogous to that of the earlier systems.\n.In their communication of  May  various trade union organizations allege that draft legislation has been prepared, the provisions of which they consider to be in breach of the freedom of association. Specifically, the complainants criticize the following:- the provision fixing at an excessively high figure the minimum number of workers and organizations required for the purpose of establishing trade unions, federations and confederations;- the provision specifying and regulating the content of the statutes;- the provision requiring that a person must have performed trade union functions before qualifying for executive office;- the provision restricting the scope of collective bargaining to enterprise or sectoral level;- the provision debarring certain workers from exercising the right to collective bargaining;- the provision under which grievances may be submitted at the sectoral or branch level only;- the provision which impairs the employers\' duty to negotiate and restrict possible recourse to compulsory arbitration at the request of one of the parties;- the provision which defines the right to strike;- the provision which prescribes the form in which a strike may be carried out;- the provision specifying which personnel are indispensable for the resumption of work.\n.Subsequently, by their communication of  July , the complainants reported that the draft legislation referred to in their preceding communication had been definitively approved on  July  by Legislative Decree No.  concerning industrial relations. The complainants state that some of the provisions of the Legislative Decree contravene Conventions Nos.  and . They criticize in particular the following:- the authoritarian imposition of models to be followed for the organization of trade unions (section );- the provisions concerning public registration, outside supervision and the State\'s discretionary power to dissolve trade union organizations (sections  and );- the provision imposing institutional restrictions on trade union organizations (section );- the provisions restricting the freedom to join a trade union and the appointment of workers\' representatives (section , subsection (a), section , subsection (c), and section , subsection (d)):section  of the Legislative Decree, issued by the de facto regime imposed on Peru on  April last, stipulates in subsection (a) that in order to become a member of a trade union a person must be ""a worker of the enterprise, activity, occupation or office that is appropriate according to the type of union"";- the provision prescribing minimum conditions to be fulfilled in order that the trade union organizations may continue to exist (section ):section  of Legislative Decree No.  provides that ""in order that a trade union may be established and continue in existence it must have at least  members if it is an enterprise union, or  members if it is a union of a different kind"";- the provisions limiting the number of members of trade union executives (sections  and );- the provision prescribing predetermined time-limits for the period of validity of collective agreements (section , subsection (c));- the provision prescribing predetermined majorities as a condition of the validity of sectoral collective agreements (section );- the provision abolishing the right to information and freedom of opinion (section );- the provisions declaring void rights acquired by virtue of agreements and violating the principle of collective autonomy (fourth transitional provision, sections , (d),  to );- the provisions pursuant to which recourse to arbitration acts as a bar to the exercise of the right to strike (sections , , ,  and );- the provision giving the authorities discretionary power to order a strike to be terminated (section );- the provision prescribing the conditions to be fulfilled before a strike may be declared (section , subsection (b));- the provisions restricting the lawful forms of strike (sections  and (b)):section  of Legislative Decree No.  provides that ""this Legislative Decree does not protect irregular forms of action, such as sudden stoppages, halting operations in vital areas or sections of the enterprise, dissuasive action in the form of go-slow working or working to rule, deliberate reduction of output or any stoppage in the course of which the workers remain in the workplace, and obstruction of entry into the workplace"". Section  provides, in its subsection (c), that ""the strike will be declared unlawful ... if it takes any of the forms referred to in section "";- the provisions restricting strikes in what are described as essential public services (sections  and ).\n.In its communication of  June  the Federation of Workers in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru states that, upon the dissolution of Parliament and ""intervention"" in the Judiciary, the Executive promulgated Legislative Decree No.  in connection with the termination, by force of law, of the validity of collective agreements as from  December . According to the said Decree:Agreements or clauses providing for automatic wage adjustments ceased to be operative on  December , the system of wage indexation in force since  in the electricity subsector being abolished; the pending collective negotiations are to be shelved; the parties or, failing agreement, the administrative authority responsible for labour questions will fix the general increment at the beginning of the negotiation; the Ministry of Labour is given regulatory power.\n.The complainants further allege that in promulgating Legislative Decree No.  of  June  the Government violates the right to stability of employment, for that Decree declares a state of emergency for the public electricity service enterprises and prescribes time-limits for the termination of contracts of employment.\n.In its communication of  July , the Federation in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru, like the CGTP and the other complainant organizations, alleges that Legislative Decree No. , promulgated on  July , violates trade union rights.\n.In its communication of  September  the Federation of Workers in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru alleges that since the formation of the new Emergency and National Reconstruction Government many trade union leaders have been induced to give up their posts under the threat of dismissal without compensation. The Federation explains that persons who decline to accept redundancy schemes are placed on the list of surplus personnel whose contracts of employment are terminated by enforceable administrative procedures. Specifically, the complainant organization mentions a large number of trade union leaders who, it says, were dismissed or forced to leave and who are members of that Federation, of the Trade Union of Workers of the Lighting and Power Industry at Trujillo, the Trade Union of ELECTROPERU and allied enterprises, the Trade Union of ELECTROPERU at Chachapoyas and allied enterprises, the Trade Union of Workers in Public Register Offices, the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Labour, the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Trade Union', ""a copy of letter\n.According to the CATP, it should be pointed out that this attempt by the employer to classify itself as an essential service is illegal from any standpoint and constitutes an anti-union practice, since it was done with the sole aim of obstructing the process of collective bargaining on the lists of demands presented before  by SINTRADUANAS, SINTRASUR and SINAUT SUNAT, which still remain to be settled. Accordingly, the trade union has contested the self-classification as an essential service before the Ministry of Labour. Lastly, the CATP states that the union asked the SUNAT to refer the case to arbitration, again with a view to exhausting peaceful means of settling the dispute as provided in the legislation, but the employer regrettably refused.\n.In its communication of  March , the Government states that, as regards the th provision of Legislative Decree No. , the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion sent letter No. --MTPE/. to the National Port Authority and letter No. --MTPE/. to the Ministry of Transport and Communications asking them to state their position on the matter. It should be pointed out that the Ministry of Transport and Communications is the lead body responsible for designing sectoral policies and drafting the regulations applicable to transport, communications and the national ports system, under section  of Act No. , the National Ports System Law. The National Port Authority has exclusive authority in regard to technical regulations, as well as other executive powers in accordance with the National Ports Development Plan. The technical opinion of both bodies is thus vitally important. The Government points out that the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion, as the ILO s interlocutor representing the State, is currently awaiting the technical opinions requested from the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the National Port Authority before taking a decision, of which the ILO will be informed. Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that domestic legislation provides for the possibility of bringing an action for accin de garanta (enforcement of constitutional rights) under the Political Constitution of Peru, and the complainants may do so to seek restoration of their rights. Article () of the Political Constitution of Peru refers to the remedy of unconstitutionality, the procedure for which is governed by Title VIII of the Code of Constitutional Procedure, Act No. . The purpose of the action for enforcement of constitutional rights is to defend the Constitution against infractions against its normative rank.\n.In its communication of  May , the Government sent additional observations as well as observations from the SUNAT, according to which the SINAUT union called the strike without the authorization of the administrative authority determining the minimum service to be maintained. The union subsequently rectified this omission, and the strike was thus considered legal. The Government and the SUNAT confirm that the negotiation of certain economic conditions could not take place for budgetary reasons.\n.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant objects to the th provision of Legislative Decree No. , which provides that the administration, operation, equipping and maintenance of publicly owned and used port infrastructure are classified as essential public services, as is the performance of port services in such infrastructure, which are guaranteed by the State; the complainant also alleges that in the context of collective bargaining the Office of the National Superintendent of the Tax Administration (SUNAT) has refused to refer the dispute to arbitration and has classified the activities carried out in that institution as essential services.\n.As regards the disputed thirtieth provision of Legislative Decree No.  classifying port services guaranteed by the State as essential public services (the provision also provides that the executive branch, in exceptional cases of interruption in the performance of such port services, shall take the necessary measures to ensure the ongoing, continuous, safe and competitive provision of services), the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the Ministry of Transport and Communications is the lead body responsible for designing sectoral policy and drafting general regulations applicable to activities relating to transport, communications and the National Ports System; () the National Port Authority has exclusive authority in regard to technical regulations, as well as other executive powers under the National Ports Development Plan; () as the technical opinion of the two bodies is vitally important, the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion sent letters asking them to state their views on the matter, and is currently awaiting the requested information; and () domestic legislation provides for the possibility of bringing an action for enforcement of constitutional rights under the Political Constitution, and the complainants may do so to seek restoration of their rights.\n.The Committee recalls that ports do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the services provided by the National Ports Enterprise and ports themselves do not constitute essential services, although they are an important public service in which a minimum service could be required in case of a strike [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In this case, the Committee requests the Government, after consulting the social partners concerned, to take the necessary steps, including legislative steps if necessary, to ensure that the classification of port activities as essential services serves only to impose a minimum service in the event of a strike, and that such a minimum service is determined not only by the public authorities, but in consultation with the workers' and employers' organizations concerned. The Committee draws this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n.As regards the allegation that, in the context of collective bargaining between SINAUT SUNAT and SUNAT, the SUNAT refuses to refer the dispute to arbitration on the grounds that it is impossible to negotiate on economic items as this is prohibited by the budget laws, the Committee regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations in this regard. The Committee recalls that when it examined allegations on obstacles placed in the way of collective bargaining in the public sector it stated that it  is aware that collective bargaining in the public sector calls for verification of the available resources in the various public bodies or undertakings, that such resources are dependent upon state budgets and that the period of duration of collective agreements in the public sector does not always coincide with the duration of budgetary laws ' a situation which can give rise to difficulties' [see th report, Case No.  (Ecuador), paras '  ]. The Committee also points out that it has stated on numerous occasions that  if, as part of its stabilization policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards'  [See Digest, op. cit., para. .]\n.The Committee further recalls that it has endorsed the point of view expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its  General Survey: legislative provisions which allow Parliament or the competent budgetary authority to set upper and lower limits for wage negotiations or to establish an overall  budgetary package' within which the parties may negotiate monetary or standard-setting clauses (for example, reduction of working hours or other arrangements, varying wage increases according to levels of remuneration, fixing a timetable for readjustment provisions) or those which give the financial authorities the right to participate in collective bargaining alongside the direct employer, are compatible with the Convention, provided they leave a significant role to collective bargaining, and the authorities should give preference as far as possible to collective bargaining in determining the conditions of employment of public servants; where the circumstances rule this out, measures of this kind should be limited in time and protect the standard of living of the workers who are the most affected. In other words, a fair and reasonable compromise should be sought between the need to preserve as far as possible the autonomy of the parties to bargaining, on the one hand, and measures which must be taken by governments to overcome their budgetary difficulties, on the other [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.In these circumstances, while it observes that, according to the complainant and as confirmed by the Government and the SUNAT invoking budgetary reasons, the representatives of the SUNAT have refused to negotiate only on economic terms having an influence on the budget, but not other terms of employment, the Committee emphasizes that the impossibility of negotiating wage increases on an ongoing basis is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No.  and requests the Government to promote appropriate mechanisms so that the parties"", ""on the declaration of a strike on  and  November .\n.In a communication dated  August , the Autonomous Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CATP), representing the complainant (the United Trade Union of SUNAT Employees (SINAUT SUNAT)), alleges that the Office of the National Superintendent of the Tax Administration (SUNAT) has engaged in practices that go against the principles of collective bargaining and good faith ever since the above union presented SUNAT with its list of demands for '  on  February . In its communication, the CATP gives a very extensive and detailed account of the various stages of the bargaining process, the main points of which are as follows: () delaying tactics and lack of specific proposals during the direct negotiation phase and lack of willingness to find solutions to the list of demands, particularly those of an economic nature, a position that SUNAT (the employer) maintained during the conciliation phase, stating that budgetary limits had to be respected; () the  counter-proposals' put forward by SUNAT on non-economic issues during the conciliation phase did not represent any real improvement; and () on  September , the eighth conciliation meeting was held; the employer representatives said that they  had not had time to review the material submitted by the union'  In response, the SINAUT negotiating committee expressed the view that such an attitude could only be interpreted as a further demonstration of bad faith and lack of real will to reach any agreement on the list of demands. At the same meeting, it was brought to the attention of the labour administration authority that, in letter No. --SUNAT/F, the SUNAT personnel management department had requested the union to restrict its use of the institutional email system to professional matters only, attempting to give the unexpected impression of being unaware that the employer had always accepted the everyday use of the system to communicate with union members and workers in general; even SUNAT itself, through its staff and representatives, has repeatedly approached the union and the workforce in general by email to state its position on various trade union matters.\n.The CATP adds that, bearing in mind that the facts outlined severely affected ' in the context described ' the normal course of collective bargaining, and added to the total lack of serious proposals from the employer and the failure to honour commitments made during discussions, together with the imposition of a new restriction that undermines free and fluid communication and coordination between the union and its units across the country, placing it at an obvious disadvantage right in the middle of conciliation talks on its list of demands, the union informed the labour administration authority that it had decided to suspend conciliation meetings. In addition, in an official letter dated  November , the union informed SUNAT of its decision to refer the dispute to labour arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Collective Labour Relations Act.\n.The CATP states that, on  October , an extra-procedural meeting was held at the offices of the Regional Directorate for Labour and Employment Promotion for Lima, to exhaust a further extra-procedural avenue in negotiating the list of demands for ' . At this meeting, SUNAT provided the union with a written document ' SUNAT SINAUT Negotiating Committee ' which mentions a set of actions implemented as  policies' by SUNAT, relating to some of the demands set out in the list. In response, the union pointed out that the  policies' being implemented by the employer are unilateral decisions that may be changed or revoked in the future on the employer s sole initiative, and they cannot therefore be viewed as benefits obtained through bargaining until a collective agreement has been signed with workers to guarantee their permanence. The meeting ended with no agreement having been reached, and on  February  the union requested the Sub-Directorate for Collective Bargaining of the Ministry of Labour to summon the parties to sign a commitment to go to arbitration. So far, neither SUNAT nor the Ministry of Labour has taken any action with regard to this arbitration request.\n.The CATP recalls, furthermore, that, with respect to the (previous) list of demands (' ), which remained unresolved, the Committee on Freedom of Association made the following recommendation in Case No. :(b)\tThe Committee emphasizes that the impossibility of negotiating wage increases on an ongoing basis is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No.  and requests the Government to promote appropriate mechanisms so that SINAUT SUNAT and SUNAT may conclude a collective agreement in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.In its communication of  December , with regard to the alleged infringement of the principle of free and voluntary bargaining through lack of will to bargain on any demands of an economic nature included in the list of demands, the Government states that article  of the Political Constitution of Peru and the General Act on the National Budgetary System, No. , lay down that the budget is allocated by an annual act and is governed by principles such as budgetary equilibrium, universality and unity, integrity, annuality and multiannual programming, among other things. Section  of the Public Sector Budget Act for the financial year , No. , stipulated that all state bodies were prohibited from altering or increasing any form of economic benefit. It further states that labour arbitration bodies are subject to the legal limitations set out in that Act.\n.In the same vein, the consolidated text of the Collective Bargaining Act, approved by Supreme Decree No. --TR, lays down, in section , paragraph , that workers in state bodies and enterprises that are part of the State s business activities, which are subject to private sector labour laws, are covered by the standards laid down in the above Act except where they contradict specific standards limiting the benefits provided by private sector labour laws.\n.It adds that, in legal report No. --SERVIR/GG-OAJ, the National Civil Service Authority (SERVIR) concludes, in response to an enquiry from SUNAT, that:The right of public servants [be they subject to public or private labour law] to bargain collectively is not exercised without restrictions, but is subject to legal limitations, including those governing budgetary matters. hese budgetary restrictions should also be applied if a dispute is referred to arbitration, under either form of labour law.\n.As regards applying the principle of good faith, the Government maintains that the assertions made by SINAUT SUNAT lack any substance, given that SUNAT has participated in the process of collective bargaining with a view to reaching agreement, sending designated representatives to the various direct negotiation, conciliation and extra-procedural meetings organized by the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion; evidence of this can be found in the minutes of conciliation meetings, as well as in the records of attendance, which not only show who was present, but also whether there was discussion between the parties so as to reach agreement as far as possible.\n.Furthermore, the Government states that, at the eighth conciliation meeting, SUNAT indicated that it had not had time to review the documentation submitted by the union. It points out in this regard that the documentation received, which consisted of  folders containing information on arbitration awards relating to various state bodies, was submitted through the public registry on  September  and received by the institution s representatives on  and  September. The information merited examination, which cannot be interpreted as a display of bad faith or lack of willingness to reach an agreement, given that SUNAT attended the meeting in question fully prepared to continue bargaining.\n.While it may be true that increases in remuneration and other economic benefits are restricted by public order provisions, SUNAT maintains that it has been willing to bargain on other matters, as is the case with working conditions. SUNAT states that, despite no agreement having been reached through the collective bargaining process for ' , various demands have already been acknowledged and acted upon, to the benefit of all workers in the institution who are covered by the measures taken, such as:' providing uniforms (clothes and shoes) to SUNAT staff;' transport for staff performing duties at offices located in high-risk or hard-to-reach areas: Callao Maritime Customs, Chucuito, San Luis and Santa Anita;' career path. With funding from the Inter-American Development Bank, the private consultancy GOBERNA SAC is currently designing a career path system that is structured and sustainable over time, promoting staff development within the institution;' internal competitions for management posts not considered positions of trust;' paid leave to look after immediate family with health problems, which in some cases may exceed the number of days requested by the union;' performance evaluation.

The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for  October  and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)\tRegarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)\tRegarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)\tRegarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)\tObserving the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)\tRegarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)\tThe Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)\tThe Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)\tRegarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)\tRegarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(k)\tRegarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence,"", ""The Committee once again draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.\n.The Committee last examined this case at its March  session, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (March )].\n.On that occasion, it requested the Government [see th Report, para. , recommendation (g)] to complete its response on certain issues and indicated its intention to consider them in detail at its May  meeting.\n.In a communication dated  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS provided additional information.\n.The Government sent additional observations in a communication dated  May .\n.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its previous examination of the case at its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee draws the Government s attention to the importance of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February  and the abduction and mistreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed (FEDECAMARAS appealed against the ruling ordering the closure of the case concerning the bomb attack on its headquarters), again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meeting held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February , and to immediately implement tripartite consultations.(e) Finally, the Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of  November  concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern the new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and takes note of the recent Government observations on some of the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to complete its response and intends to review the issues raised therein in a detailed manner at its next meeting in May .(h) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extremely serious and urgent nature of this case.\n.In respect of recommendation (g), the report on the previous examination of the case only contains a very brief summary of the allegations and the responses from the Government as these were only received shortly before the Committee s March  meeting. Accordingly, a detailed account of the said allegations and the responses from the Government is provided below.\n.In a communication of  March , the IOE and the Venezuelan business association FEDECAMARAS denounce once again the continuing harassment of the country s free employers by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and protest to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO about new attacks on the private sector and on private Venezuelan companies, many of which are members of FEDECAMARAS, the county s most representative employers' organization. This tactic comprises new acts of aggression and public vilification by the Venezuelan Government targeted against Venezuelan companies and employers, which in the month of February  alone resulted in the sudden detention of more than  employers and managers of companies distributing food and medicines and of private union organizations providing in-patient care, supermarket servicing and meat distribution, along with the de facto seizure, by the Government, of a private food-distribution company, accusing it of conspiring against the Government, without due process or respect for their right to defence, incidents which have been widely publicized by the media.\n.The complainant organizations recall that, one year ago, in March , the ILO officially requested the Venezuelan Government to urgently adopt an action plan to launch a social dialogue in the country based on respect and the absence of intimidation against independent and representative employers' and trade union organizations. This insistent request was prompted by concerns relating to violation of the right to freedom of association and the freedom to form trade unions of employers and workers in the"", ""Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops and the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the urgency of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to  years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February .(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October , and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of the managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings; and, in view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial, and it invites the complainant organizations to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.(g) As regards the allegations of the detention of the president of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the president of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, and allegations of shadowing and harassment of the president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Jorge Roig, given the divergences between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.(h) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee regrets that the Government has not made any observation concerning their impact on social dialogue and, deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, it firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.(i) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(j) The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  May , in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners, of  national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February ; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.(k)""]"

The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any such inquiry and on its outcome.(d) In general, the Committee draws to the Government\'s attention the principle that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed.\n.In a communication dated  June , the ICFTU refers to a mission which it sent from  January to  February  to Central America, where among other countries it visited Guatemala. According to information received by the mission, Guatemala is living in a state of insecurity because of the persistent policy of intimidation and terror employed against the population, while the practice of arrest and disappearance has become a standard and systematic instrument of repression from which an alarming number of victims have suffered, especially trade union leaders both in the towns and in the country.\n.The ICFTU adds that the mission drew up a list of cases of arrest and disappearance, assassinations and attacks on trade union leaders and activists;  instances of arrest and disappearance and  assassinations were cited between  and May . The list of trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or been kidnapped, assassinated or physically attacked appears in an annex to this report. (This list does not include persons already cited in other cases brought before the Committee on Freedom of Association.)\n.In its communication dated  July , the WFTU refers to the kidnapping of trade union leader Felicita Floridalma Lucero, an allegation that was previously brought before the Committee in connection with Case No. .\n.In its communication dated  September , FASGUA alleges that on  September  the body was discovered of Eleazar Esa Barrera Martnez, an employee of the textile factory Fbrica de Tejidos Imperial who had been kidnapped during mass demonstrations against the increase in prices and in support of wage claims. According to FASGUA, his body was found hanging by the neck from an electric wire and bore signs of torture.\n.FASGUA adds that on the morning of  September  nurse Rita Josefina Pineda Aldana was kidnapped by armed men.\n.Finally, FASGUA alleges that on  September ,  members of the National Army supported by  artillery trucks and about  tanks launched an attack on the University of San Carlos and searched every building, including the headquarters of the University Workers\' Union where they caused extensive damage and seized trade union documents.\n.The Government states in its communications dated  August  that all the complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association communicated to it by the ILO have been passed on to the Ministry of the Interior with instructions to transmit to the Committee on Freedom of Association any information that may come to light as a result of its inquiries.\n.The Government adds that a copy of the statement it received to the effect that Floridalma Lucero y Lucero and Amancio Samuel Villatoro had disappeared has been communicated to the competent tribunal and that investigations are being conducted to determine their whereabouts. With respect to the disappearance of Julin Revolorio, Raymundo Prez, Yolanda Urizar Martnez de Aguilar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Victor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her children, Fermn Solano, Antonio Argeta and Sergio Venicio Samayoa Morales, the Government states that none of the persons cited are being held in any of the country\'s detention centres but that inquiries are being made into their whereabouts. The Government indicates that, in the case of investigations of this nature, the judiciary is duly informed by the General Directorate of the National Police through the competent tribunal.\n.The Government states further that it has collaborated closely with the judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice in the investigations into disappearances and in the habeas corpus proceedings. The Head of State has accordingly set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared; in its efforts to arrive at the truth, the Committee has conducted an investigation throughout the country, issued the necessary orders to all state security forces and invited the civilian authorities to collaborate. It appears from the investigations that the persons whose names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.\n.The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared are listed as official residents of that country. The Government indicates that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the law, the State Prosecutor\'s Office has initiated penal proceedings with the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal Branch of the Departments of Petn, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings already initiated. The Government states that in the course of the investigations conducted in the various departments of the Republic, no allegations were made regarding the existence of detention centres other than the legally constituted penal centres for preventive detention and for the serving of prison sentences.\n.The Government declares that the committee has conducted a thorough official investigation at the national level, employing all possible means at its disposal, and that its report constitutes the most thorough investigation of the problem of ""disappeared persons"" that the present Government has carried out in its efforts to establish the facts.\n.Finally, with respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal Textiles Factory, the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Directorate collaborated fully with the workers who had lodged a petition against its closure. According to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement which included the payment of compensation. The only point on which agreement was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate, concerned five trade union leaders. Charges were accordingly brought against the undertaking in June  with the competent labour tribunal which has not yet handed down its ruling.\n.The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that the Head of State has set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared and that the Committee has conducted a nation-wide investigation with the collaboration of the civilian and military authorities. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the persons listed as having disappeared are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, inquiries have been made into the whereabouts of trade union leaders Felicita Floridalma Lucero y Lucero, Amancio Samuel Villatorio and Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales. The Committee also notes the Government\'s statement that it has not yet been possible to establish the whereabouts of other kidnapped trade union leaders and members (Julin Revolorio, Raimundo Prez, Yolanda Urzar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Vctor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her two children, Fermn Solano and Antonia Argeta). The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied any details on the other  trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of  trade union leaders and members and physical attacks on another union leader. The Committee further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade union leader Alvaro Ren Sosa.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the International Labour Conference in its  Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties. It expresses its profound concern at the seriousness of a situation in which a large number of trade union leaders and members', 'case the allegation concerns the kidnapping of the brother of a trade union leader who had escaped various attempts at capture), the Committee urgently requests the Government to carry out the necessary investigations to determine the whereabouts of the persons who have allegedly disappeared and to initiate a judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties for the kidnappings or attempted kidnappings.

According to FASGUA, his body was found hanging by the neck from an electric wire and bore signs of torture.\n.FASGUA adds that on the morning of  September  nurse Rita Josefina Pineda Aldana was kidnapped by armed men.\n.Finally, FASGUA alleges that on  September ,  members of the National Army supported by  artillery trucks and about  tanks launched an attack on the University of San Carlos and searched every building, including the headquarters of the University Workers\' Union where they caused extensive damage and seized trade union documents.\n.The Government states in its communications dated  August  that all the complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association communicated to it by the ILO have been passed on to the Ministry of the Interior with instructions to transmit to the Committee on Freedom of Association any information that may come to light as a result of its inquiries.\n.The Government adds that a copy of the statement it received to the effect that Floridalma Lucero y Lucero and Amancio Samuel Villatoro had disappeared has been communicated to the competent tribunal and that investigations are being conducted to determine their whereabouts. With respect to the disappearance of Julin Revolorio, Raymundo Prez, Yolanda Urizar Martnez de Aguilar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Victor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her children, Fermn Solano, Antonio Argeta and Sergio Venicio Samayoa Morales, the Government states that none of the persons cited are being held in any of the country\'s detention centres but that inquiries are being made into their whereabouts. The Government indicates that, in the case of investigations of this nature, the judiciary is duly informed by the General Directorate of the National Police through the competent tribunal.\n.The Government states further that it has collaborated closely with the judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice in the investigations into disappearances and in the habeas corpus proceedings. The Head of State has accordingly set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared; in its efforts to arrive at the truth, the Committee has conducted an investigation throughout the country, issued the necessary orders to all state security forces and invited the civilian authorities to collaborate. It appears from the investigations that the persons whose names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.\n.The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared are listed as official residents of that country. The Government indicates that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the law, the State Prosecutor\'s Office has initiated penal proceedings with the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal Branch of the Departments of Petn, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings already initiated. The Government states that in the course of the investigations conducted in the various departments of the Republic, no allegations were made regarding the existence of detention centres other than the legally constituted penal centres for preventive detention and for the serving of prison sentences.\n.The Government declares that the committee has conducted a thorough official investigation at the national level, employing all possible means at its disposal, and that its report constitutes the most thorough investigation of the problem of ""disappeared persons"" that the present Government has carried out in its efforts to establish the facts.\n.Finally, with respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal Textiles Factory, the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Directorate collaborated fully with the workers who had lodged a petition against its closure. According to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement which included the payment of compensation. The only point on which agreement was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate, concerned five trade union leaders. Charges were accordingly brought against the undertaking in June  with the competent labour tribunal which has not yet handed down its ruling.\n.The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that the Head of State has set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared and that the Committee has conducted a nation-wide investigation with the collaboration of the civilian and military authorities. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the persons listed as having disappeared are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, inquiries have been made into the whereabouts of trade union leaders Felicita Floridalma Lucero y Lucero, Amancio Samuel Villatorio and Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales. The Committee also notes the Government\'s statement that it has not yet been possible to establish the whereabouts of other kidnapped trade union leaders and members (Julin Revolorio, Raimundo Prez, Yolanda Urzar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Vctor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her two children, Fermn Solano and Antonia Argeta). The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied any details on the other  trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of  trade union leaders and members and physical attacks on another union leader. The Committee further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade union leader Alvaro Ren Sosa.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the International Labour Conference in its  Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties. It expresses its profound concern at the seriousness of a situation in which a large number of trade union leaders and members']"

It should be noted that this situation developed following the attack and destruction of the Twin Towers in the United States, and that this incident obviously had an effect on some of the events denounced by the trade union, but does not provide a single or sufficient explanation.\n.The Government then lists a series of events which, as it points out, constitute anti-union practices.Individual bargaining between the enterprise and pilots\n.During the second quarter of , the enterprise created subsidiary enterprises to which some unionized pilots were transferred following individual bargaining, which provided them with access to improved financial conditions, and their withdrawal of trade union membership. This process was public knowledge and was even encouraged by company executives.Publicity campaign against collective bargaining\n.The atmosphere being experienced within Lan Chile S.A. was made known to the public through articles in the press that appeared repeatedly from August  onwards. These articles pointed out that the collective bargaining process to be carried out by the pilots was a threat to the entreprise and to the country s economy given that the bargaining appeared to be intrinsically linked to conflicts and paralysis. These conclusions stem from articles that appeared in the  El Mercurio' newspaper during August .\n.In a public notice, the trade union s executive board qualified these articles in the press as a campaign against the trade union in order to discredit the workers' organization and discourage collective bargaining by generating a negative public opinion. The trade union responded by implementing the industrial action entitled  work-to-rule'  consisting in fulfilling the provisions of aeronautical regulations to the letter. This obviously involved the non-infringement of applicable standards, but also involved straying from the usual practices employed by the enterprise in air navigation processes, and which are outside the regulations, in order to cut costs for fuel and other consumables.Mass dismissal of active trade union members\n.These events were followed by the mass dismissal of unionized pilots. Between  September and  October , the company dismissed  members. In  of these cases the company invoked  company requirements' as the reason for the dismissals and in  cases it invoked the  serious breach of contractual obligations'  When the enterprise describes the serious breach of contractual obligations, it refers, inter alia, to confusing situations which led to delays for some flights. However, there is no clear relationship between the delays and the breach of contracts or internal regulations.\n.Following the dismissal of these  workers, the company reinstated  of them. Amongst those not reinstated were eight former trade union directors and workers who participated in the  legal strike. Therefore, the measure was highly discriminatory given that, in essence, it affected the most active members of the organization, namely those who were dismissed for respecting a trade union agreement consisting in  work-to-rule'  without violating contractual or legal standards.\n.The  workers affected filed a motion to vacate the dismissals before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago, filed under  Bustamante and Others versus Lan Chile S.A.' (Case No. -).Reduction in the workers' negotiating power\n.The dismissals prior to the commencement of collective bargaining had repercussions on the collective bargaining process promoted by the trade union in that only  members participated. This represents a  per cent reduction in the number of participants compared with the previous collective bargaining process. The process was concluded without a strike and a four-year collective agreement was signed, with a  per cent reduction in the pay increase that otherwise would have been due. At the same time, the entreprise came to an agreement with three groups of pilots, who during the previous negotiation process formed part of the trade union, in the form of -month collective agreements with a lower pay adjustment.Pressure exerted by Lan Chile S.A. for thewithdrawal of trade union membership\n.Following inspections by the employment services during the course of , it was established that unionized pilots and technicians were subjected to intense pressure aimed at making them withdraw membership from their trade union organization. This is shown in documents and communications issued by the employer which offer improved conditions of work that are incompatible with continued trade union membership. This approach was also reflected in the implicit threats of dismissal that were made by some supervisors and acknowledged by some workers during conversations with the officer from the Labour Inspectorate. As a result, the trade union executive board received membership withdrawals from mid- until the first-quarter of ; it currently has only  members.Discrimination against trade unionmembers with regard to training\n.Lan Chile S.A. excluded trade union members from flight training for operating the new company airplanes. This was subsequently taken up by the trade union executive board with the employer, but this measure was not reversed. In the past, training was considered a recompense for pilots' seniority. According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the enterprise, such exclusion became apparent shortly before the collective bargaining process began. According to the information provided by the trade union executive board, this segregation still continues during the present year.Conditions for the reinstatement of dismissed pilots\n.According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the company in ,  pilots dismissed for disciplinary reasons, for having participated in the action entitled  work-to-rule'  were reinstated by the employer with the condition that they write a letter in which they had to acknowledge responsibility for the possible damage the industrial action may have caused; furthermore, they had to blame the trade union for forcing them into the alleged transgression. With their new individual contracts, these pilots did not regain the collective benefits that they had previously enjoyed.Replacement of dismissed unionized pilotsby recruiting foreign pilots\n.The company failed to comply when requested for information by the inspectors in order to determine the legality of such recruitment. As a result of this conduct, the enterprise was fined on three occasions, on the most recent occasion, it was given the maximum administrative sanction for hindering the labour inspector s work.Harassment of trade union officials: Failure to grant thework agreed upon and professional disqualification\n.In August , a complaint was made about the suspension from everyday duties of the trade union directors, Messrs. Nibaldo Jorquera and Artidoro Leal, and Lan Chile S.A. was sanctioned for failing to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contract. This also happened to the official Baldovino Bendix.\n.This conduct began to take the form of excluding trade union officials from work schedules, which are documents used to notify each pilot of his flight itinerary, rest periods, training activities and other events for the following month. The collective agreement obliges the employer to provide this document.\n.In January , another administrative fine was issued for failing to provide the officials Jozcef Szita, Artidoro Leal, Nibaldo Jorquera and Baldovino Bendix with work schedules and for failing to grant the first two mentioned officials the agreed upon work.\n.It should be pointed out that, according to the provisions of the Civil Aeronautical Authority, in order to keep their license, pilots must be accredited with a determined number of flight hours. Without such a license they cannot work as pilots or co-pilots. In practice this amounts to professional disqualification and makes it impossible for them to work for this, or another, aviation company since they fail to meet the essential requirements.\n.Moreover, the Government indicates the effects of the action taken by Lan Chile S.A. which constitutes anti-union and unfair practices in collective bargaining:' Trade union membership. After having been the most representative union and bringing together nearly all of the pilots and technicians at Lan Chile S.A., with  members, the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians now has only  members, as a result of the dismissals, membership withdrawals and creation of subsidiary enterprises.' Trade union executive board. In October , the trade union executive board was composed of five members. In the first-quarter of , only one director remained in service since three officials left the company, in one case following legal proceedings which lead to an agreement, and in the other cases following out-of-court negotiations. The last reorganization of the executive board, on  May , only enabled the election of three directors.' Trade union assets. In view of the reduction in membership, the trade union stopped receiving a significant amount of resources, in the form of trade union dues. Therefore, the trade union was forced to move to smaller headquarters and reduce the number of officers and advisers.' Collective bargaining. The collective bargaining of pilots, which until  had been carried out exclusively by the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians, was significantly fragmented during the last negotiating process, and therefore led to fewer collective benefits. Moreover, by negotiating separately, three groups signed instruments for  months, whereas the trade"", 'of Chile stated that on  April  it had presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on  April , raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article  of Legislative Decree No. . On  May , after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the  members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union pointed out that the persons concerned were covered by an indefinite work contract and had more than  years\' continuous service in the undertaking. The union added that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on  May  a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicated that it had submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.\n.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleged that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants\' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since  July . On several occasions, armed and masked civilians had conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers had been rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home had again been searched and his wife severely beaten.\n.In its communication of  September , the FISE referred to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE feared that his life was in danger.\n.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, referred to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation pointed out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, had been sought by persons in civilian clothes on  September , when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n.CONSTRAMET indicated that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno had been sought by the police since the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency,  September . Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, was under permanent surveillance, as were the Confederation\'s offices. The complainant organisation also indicated that the police authorities had prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.\n.FENATRATEX referred to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explained that these officials had been declared responsible for the fact that  of the  workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on  September , as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which had been occupied by law enforcement agents. The undertaking then arbitrarily applied sections . and . of Legislative Decree No.  which penalises unlawful acts preventing the worker from being present at his work or discharging his obligations as a worker and the direction of or active participation in any unlawful interruption or stoppage of work. The dismissals were decided without notice being given, without the right to compensation and in contravention of ""trade union immunity"".\n.FENATRATEX indicated that  workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking had had to take the risk of meeting in private houses to discuss a draft collective agreement since a consequence of the proclamation of the state of emergency was to prohibit meetings of trade unions which do not possess their own premises.\n.The Miners\' Confederation alleged that several trade unionists had been dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining: in particular, the former official of the Lota Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), Fresia Mellado Opazo, and ten workers of Union No.  of Victoria de Lbu. It was alleged further that an official of ENACAR Union No. , Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, had been disqualified from holding his union post and that workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, including the trade union official Rolando Chacana Ganza, had been arrested for purported theft of explosives. Lastly, it was alleged that, at the Agustinas de Copiapo mine, the Agustinas mining enterprise had unilaterally decided to lower salaries in  and  at a time when the collective agreement was in force.\n.Finally, in a joint letter several Chilean national confederations indicated that the homes of officials of the Catering Confederation and the El Surco, Manuel Caro Castro and Enrique Avendao Atenas Peasants\' Confederation had been visited by unidentified persons.\n.In its communication of  October , the WCOTP refers to acts committed against teachers and their trade union officials since proclamation of the state of emergency in the country. Thus, on  September , Mr. Gaston Vidaurrazaga Manriquez was taken from his home and murdered. His body was found south of Santiago. Three other teacher trade union officials, Nelly Lemus, Julio Lobos and Berta Moya were threatened with death.\n.The WCOTP also refers to the detention of Guillermo Scherping Villegas, Under-General-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) (already mentioned in an earlier complaint) and of Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing, teacher, who has been in jail since  September .\n.Lastly, the WCOTP alleges the dismissal of several teachers, including Mr. Fernando Azula, a national official of AGECH, who had previously been dismissed from educational institutions in  and . On  September , an armed forces group searched his home, and he was held in custody for some time. During a visit to Spain, he had given an interview on  August  to the newspaper ""El Tiempo"". On  September , he was dismissed by Presidential Decree No.  for having made that statement to the press. The WCOTP believes that his dismissal was mainly due to his trade union activities.\n.In its communication of  November , FENATRATEX complains of the withdrawal of the legal personality of the Inter-Works Union of Workers of Textile Enterprises of Santiago Province. This measure is alleged to have been taken because the union had complained to the Minister of Labour about anomalies in the textile sector. The withdrawal of the legal personality will also entail, for the second time, the seizure of its assets, inherited by virtue of a judicial decision from the industrial union ""Tejidos Musalem"" (its property had been seized for the first time in ).\n.In its communication of  December , the Miners\' Confederation of Chile indicates that on  November  two officials of Trade Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise\'s Lota plant were arrested and required to open the union\'s office so that a search could be made. Since nothing was found, the two officials were freed. On  December, however, a group from the National Centre of Investigations again searched the union\'s office, where this time pamphlets and explosives mysteriously appeared. A union official, Julio Salazar Sierra, and one of its members, Patricio Sanhuza, were arrested.\n.In its communication of  January , the WCOTP refers to the Minister of the Interior\'s adoption of an Order (No. ) dated  May  and concerning the reduction of the number of teachers in municipal schools. According to the instructions contained in this order, the Minister did not intend to extend the contracts of retired teachers, or those over  having  years of service, or those having more than  years of service. Later on, those teachers who did not have the necessary qualifications would apparently be dismissed. According to the WCOTP, this order was used differently: working teachers who were well qualified were dismissed because of their trade union activities. The WCOTP quotes a statement made by the Superintendent of the Concepcin region to the effect that ""political agitation will not be tolerated in schools"". It considers that there is a real danger that trade union activities will be deemed to be political agitation.\n.In support of the allegations contained in its communicatioin of  February , the WCOTP supplies a list of  officials of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) and of  officials of the Teachers\' College of Chile who have been dismissed. It also supplies the breakdown, by province, of the number of dismissed teachers, which has now reached ,.\n.As regards the judicial appeals lodged by six workers dismissed from the National Copper Corporation, the Government indicates that the judge at El Salvador only allowed one of these workers\' appeals (that of Mr. Ral Nuez Tapia) and ordered', 'that a request be made with ten days\' notice for authorisation by the Chief of the area under the state of emergency to hold meetings in public places. The National Grouping of Workers (CNT) satisfied these requirements but did not even receive an acknowledgement in reply. In view of this situation, the CNT leadership called on the workers and the population of Santiago to meet on the Plaza de los Hroes on  May at  a.m.\n.The report also indicates that on  April the authorities had prevented the holding of an artistic and cultural event at union premises of the Confederation of Leather and Footwear Workers to celebrate May Day.\n.On  May the city of Santiago was practically occupied by the police and the military. In spite of this climate, thousands of people approached the meeting place and, when the first groups formed, the police forces hurled projectiles and tear gas at them. Dozens of persons were wounded. All persons and all vehicles were checked and approximately  persons arrested, including Manuel Bustos, Vice-President of the CNT, Jorge Mills, a member of the national council of the CNT, and Humberto Arcos, an official of the Confederation of Unions of Workers in the Metal Industry. The majority of these persons were released on the same day with a summons to appear before the Police Court for having caused a disturbance of the peace.\n.Also on the morning of  May, two trade union premises belonging to the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH) and to the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) were illegally searched. Furniture and documents were destroyed or removed. The persons present were threatened, certain of them were struck, and  teachers attending a meeting at the premises of the AGECH were arrested, although organisations with a legal personality (as in the case of the AGECH) are not required to request authorisation to hold meetings at their own premises to deal with matters within their competence.\n.In its communication of  June , the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) alleges that on  April  the Director-General for Industrial Relations of the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO) notified  workers of the termination of their work contract on the basis of article (f) of Legislative Decree No. . This provision permits an employer to dismiss workers without specifying the grounds for dismissal, with  days\' notice or by paying compensation of an amount equal to the last monthly wage. According to the CTC, this permits the Government and employers, as in this case, to take discriminatory measures against trade unions.\n.The CTC states that all those affected by this measure were skilled workers, had behaved irreproachably and had from  to  years\' service in the undertaking. The only possible grounds for their dismissal are therefore their active participation in trade union meetings and activities. Furthermore, four of them were about to become trade union officials. Moreover, this measure was intended to intimidate the workers in the undertaking in order to impede their trade union action. These assumptions are substantiated by the fact that on the day of the dismissals, the two unions of El Salvador with the largest number of affiliates had convened assemblies for the purpose of putting their affairs in order following the disqualification of their leaders decreed by the Ministry of Labour. These assemblies unanimously rejected the dismissals and condemned the measure taken by CODELCO. For ten days,  of the dismissed workers went on hunger strike.\n.In its communication of  June , the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company of Chile states that on  April  it presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on  April , raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article  of Legislative Decree No. . On  May , after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the  members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union points out that the persons concerned are covered by an indefinite work contract and have more than  years\' continuous service in the undertaking. The union adds that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on  May  a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicates that it submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.\n.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleges that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants\' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since  July . On several occasions, armed and masked civilians conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers was rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home was again searched and his wife severely beaten.\n.In its communication of  September , the FISE refers to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE fears that his life is in danger.\n.Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile states in its communication of  September  that on  September police officers arrived at the Union\'s offices for the purpose of evicting the six workers referred to in a previous complaint presented by the Confederation of Copper Workers, as well as their families who had organised a soup kitchen on the premises since their dismissal by the National Copper Corporation, at a time when they enjoyed trade union ""immunity"". The police officer responsible for this eviction presented no document issued by a competent authority.\n.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, refers to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation points out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, was sought by persons in civilian clothes on  September , when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n.CONSTRAMET indicates that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno were sought by the police as of the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency,  September . Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, is under permanent surveillance, as are the Confederation\'s offices. The complainant organisation also indicates that the police authorities prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.\n.FENTATREX refers to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explains that these officials were declared responsible for the fact that  of the  workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on  September , as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which was occupied by law enforcement agents.

The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.\n.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.\n.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee\'s recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.\n.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.\n.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country\'s international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.\n.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government\'s communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .\n.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.\n.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.\n.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers\' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.\n.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.\n.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.\n.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.\n.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,\n.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.\n.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.\n.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.\n.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.\n.Lastly,', '.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).\n.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.\n.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May .

The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October ) and the report of the Committee of Experts, , which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. ,  and . Both reports clearly and openly state the improvements which have been made in labour legislation, improvements which go even further than the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the allegations are no longer relevant or have any legal basis.\n.The Government adds that, contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Government of Costa Rica, pursuant to the agreement reached with representatives of the major trade union organizations in November , began drafting regulations to improve the understanding and implementation of Act No. . The draft was transmitted for consultation to the representatives of the major trade unions, so that they could suggest amendments to the text and then, on the basis of consensus, the final version could be drawn up.\n.It is essential to point out that the Government of Costa Rica, on  August , through a unique move in the history of labour legislation in Costa Rica, designed to bring the country up to date, reinstated the Central Labour Council and submitted a total of  international Conventions and  Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference for consultation to this national tripartite body. The Government is willing now and in the future to maintain permanent and open dialogue with this body on issues of national interest.\n.The Government states that the administration or management of termination funds does not fall to solidarist associations alone. In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.\n.The Government points out that the complainants\' comments on section  of the Labour Code which prohibits strikes in the public services and the agricultural sector are no longer valid because a Bill on public employment drawn up with ILO technical assistance has been finalized and put before the Legislative Assembly. This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.\n.With regard to collective bargaining in the public administration, the Bill on public employment was submitted to the Legislature in April  and published in the Official Journal (La Gaceta) on  July , in accordance with the national and international commitments made by the previous government. The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its competent administrative bodies, has dealt diligently and objectively with all the proceedings instituted by workers and their representative organizations with regard to the dispute in the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Proyecto Islas enterprise. These administrative proceedings ultimately led to far-reaching agreements which ended the dispute.\n.In a document dated  April , Mr. Luis Pablo Zuiga Morales, representing SITAGAH and FENTRAP, informed the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that workers on banana plantations , ,  and  belonging to the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. had been on strike for three days because the enterprise was refusing to negotiate the rates of pay for various tasks with standing committees, in accordance with the direct agreement. He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers\' standing committee, the union\'s request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day,  April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On  April  the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and  May  because the employer\'s representatives failed to attend. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, throughout this situation, remained diligent and committed to establishing dialogue and understanding, as the records show.\n.Nevertheless, the Government adds, although another meeting had been called for  May , a new unexpected strike broke out throughout the plantations belonging to Geest Caribbean, Proyecto Islas, Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia. At that point, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took steps once again to reach a settlement. In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on  May . On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute. Subsequently, several meetings were held in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to monitor compliance with the terms set out in the agreement.\n.To date, the third item in the agreement is still to be resolved, hopefully in the next few days, since the legal representatives of the enterprise and the trade union organization attended the tenth meeting of the Committee on Work on Plantations held at the ILO, Geneva, Switzerland.\n.The Government considers that the complainants are misrepresenting the facts by contradicting what they themselves stated in item  of the aforementioned agreement dated  May , to the effect that ""both parties place on record their gratitude to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, Dr. Farid Ayales Esna, for his timely and valuable mediation in this matter. Thanks to his diligence, the parties reached an acceptable agreement in the interests of industrial peace in the Sarapiqu area."" ""Both parties"" means the Geest Caribbean Americas enterprise and the SITAGAH trade union. This was how the situation stood and on the principle of good-faith bargaining and legal security, The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, by acting as mediator and finding a solution to the dispute has shown its commitment to ensuring respect for the terms agreed between the parties, and the case of Geest Caribbean has been no exception, as is clear from the documents appended. They show the Government\'s repeated efforts to ensure implementation of the terms of the oft-mentioned agreement dated  May , in full respect of the ""pacta sunt servanda"" principle.\n.In this context, the Government considers that the complaint is rash, irrelevant and damaging to the principle of good faith since the process leading to implementation of the items in the agreement is under way, and the SITAGAH union leadership signed an agreement settling the dispute, but days later lodged a complaint with the ILO against the', ' of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.\n.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer\'s arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer\'s prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers\' legitimate strike.\n.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members\' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers\' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.\n.In April , the employer\'s arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers\' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer\'s representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer\'s arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers\' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.\n.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.\n.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.\n.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.\n.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.\n.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of  November  reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to  (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.\n.With regard to the allegation of restrictions on collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, the Government points out that it has been negotiating specific legislation on public employment which contains express provisions on the settlement of collective disputes and the right to strike in this sector since the beginning of  with trade union organizations (including the complainant). With regard to ruling No. - of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on  March , following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the', ' of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.\n.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer\'s arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer\'s prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers\' legitimate strike.\n.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members\' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers\' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.\n.In April , the employer\'s arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers\' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer\'s representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer\'s arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers\' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.\n.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.\n.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.\n.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.\n.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.\n.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds.

The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos.  and ) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. ,  and ) by the International Organisation of Employers.\n.Cases Nos.  and  were last examined by the Committee at its November  meeting and Cases Nos.  and  in February . (See respectively th Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (November  and February-March ).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. .\n.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated  May  (for Case No. ),  August  (for Cases Nos. , ,  and ),  January  (for Cases Nos.  and ) and  February  (for Cases Nos. ,  and ).\n.In addition, in a communication of  June , several employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of ,  and  January .\n.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.\n.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.\n.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.\n.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.\n.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. .) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.\n.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.\n.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September , the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.\n.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these measures corresponded to the needs of agrarian reform. While realising that the persons mentioned in the IOE's complaint cannot take advantage of their position as COSEP leaders to evade the consequences of an agrarian reform policy, the Committee must nevertheless point out with concern that these measures have allegedly affected a large number of leaders of the employers' organisation in a discriminatory fashion. It expresses the hope that the persons in question will be fairly compensated for their losses as provided for by law.\n.The Committee notes the Government's statement that there is no trace of any expulsion order against Mr. Frank Bendaa, the Vice-President of COSEP. Given the contradiction between the complainants' version of the facts and that of the Government, the Committee can only recall generally, that the expulsion of leaders of employers' or workers' organisations from their country for having been involved in activities linked to their position, is not only contrary to human rights, but also interferes in the activities of the organisations to which they belong (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada) para. ).\n.The Government has not made a specific reply to the requests for information concerning the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day. It confines itself to stating that no citizen was deprived of his liberty on that occasion. The Committee notes this information but regrets that the authorities banned the celebrating of this Private Enterprise Day.\n.The Committee notes that the newspaper La Prensa is once again circulating freely and expresses the hope that this measure will be final. It would, indeed, recall that the right of an employers' or workers' organisation to express its opinions uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. ).\n.Lastly, as concerns the suspension of the state of emergency, the Committee refers to the considerations set out hereafter concerning the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.The Governing Body must consider, in the present case, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry under article  of the Constitution. This complaint contains allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No.  based mainly on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional freedoms, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the absence of free collective bargaining; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the Government's failure to consult the COSEP.\n.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it has adopted conclusions which were approved by the Governing Body, and which contain precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases are in a number"", "".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, alleging infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee has examined these matters on several occasions, in particular in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot in September-October  by a study mission, and in February and May  (see th and th Reports, approved by the Governing Body at its nd and rd Sessions (February-March and May  respectively)).\n.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted further information in communications dated  June and  August . The Government supplied information in communications dated  June and  and  October .\n.During its examination of the cases in May , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:(a) As regards the drafting of a new Labour Code, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations are still being held with employers' and workers' organisations, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. Noting with concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted by the Government, the Committee requests the Government to hear the views of this organisation and to send rapidly an assistance request to the Office. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code, while expressing the firm hope that all the opinions expressed by the employers' and workers' organisations will be taken into account, without exception.(b) Concerning the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that a new Act on communications media has been adopted. It notes with regret that the Ministry of the Interior retains the power to impose temporary suspensions on the media. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the decrees violating freedom of speech in economic matters, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.(c) With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a meeting concerning the agricultural sector has taken place and that such a meeting will be organised in the near future for the industrial sector. The Committee asks the Government to indicate whether the COSEP was invited to these meetings as an employers' organisation. The Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing tripartite consultations commission on international labour standards, composed of all workers' and employers' organisations without exception. It requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in that respect.(d) As regards the detentions, the Committee notes with interest that Messrs. Alegra, Quant and several CUS trade unionists have been released. The Committee deplores that these persons have been detained for long periods and expresses the hope that they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in conformity with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the arrest on  June  of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, and on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza.(f) The Committee once more requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged detention of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.(g) Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November Session the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.\n.In its communication dated  June , the IOE alleges that, following a meeting held two days earlier by the Association of Coffee Producers of Nicaragua (UNCAFENIC), affiliated to COSEP, at which the policy of the Coffee Committee, an official body, was seriously challenged, the Government decided on the immediate expropriation of the land owned by the Association's President, A. Alemn Lacayo, and by N. Bolaos Geyer and J. Cuadra Sommabira, officials of UNCAFENIC and of the Association of Coffee Producers of Magalpa, the town where the meeting was held. The officials were accused by the Government of refusing to negotiate and of encouraging anarchy, confrontation and the breakdown of negotiations. In fact, UNCAFENIC is in total disagreement with an economic policy that is being imposed on it through so-called negotiations and is making its opinion known to its members, which is the role and the right of an employers' organisation.\n.In the view of the IOE, the expropriation is very much in the spirit of similar measures that have been brought to the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association on numerous occasions, which are designed to intimidate and muzzle the leaders of COSEP and of one of its principal members, the Union of Agricultural Producers of Nicaragua (UPANIC).\n.The IOE mentions another instance of arbitrary confiscation of land belonging to a COSEP leader that was ordered as a reprisal after COSEP criticised the Government's economic policy. The day after the holding of a meeting on  July  in Estelli to prepare COSEP's General Assembly, the Government confiscated the land of the President and host of the preparatory meeting, Jos Mara Briones.\n.The IOE recalls that the President of the Republic announced in a statement on  January  that no more land would be confiscated. According to the IOE, the fact that the Government has gone back on these recent undertakings, as it has done so often in the past, should at last convince the Committee that the Government is pursuing its discriminatory policy, is endeavouring to destabilise COSEP and is accordingly continuing to attack its leaders systematically.\n.In its communication dated  August  the IOE submits a number of comments on the earlier replies - or lack of replies - from the Government. The IOE believes that the Government is attempting to pass off a number of measures it claims to have taken as a policy of consultation and negotiation with the social partners, including in the areas coming within the purview of the ILO. The Government's statements to this effect are misleading, if not downright untruths: either the measures were never taken by the Government or never involved COSEP or its members as such, or else they were taken in very different circumstances from those suggested by the Government. The IOE cites a number of examples.\n.According to the IOE, for instance, the national tripartite consultations in the agricultural sector that are presented as tangible evidence of negotiation involved neither COSEP nor UPANIC, a member of COSEP, as such, but were held with people hand-picked by the Government from among the members of COSEP and UPANIC. Neither COSEP nor UPANIC, as such, were able to have their views represented.\n.The IOE goes on to state that, when these organisations got together as best they could to discuss how to put across their points of view, which happened to disagree with the Government's economic policy,"", "".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua.

A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers\' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union.

The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.\n.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints.

Here is the', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['.The complaints were presented by a number of national trade unions: the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Pernambuco (FETAPE), the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of Sao Paulo (FTIC), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) . They were originally submitted to the ILO prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . The Government has since sent information on these cases in communications dated  April and  and  May .\n.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence committed by employers against workers, trade union activists and union leaders in the sugar cane plantations and alcohol distilleries of several States of Brazil, and specifically in Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, and to the failure of the Government to put a stop to them.\n.In the case of the State of Pernambuco in particular, the allegations concern the banning of union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and even the assassination of union leaders or their relations simply for having demanded the implementation or renewal of collective agreements. Moreover, the complainants claim that a situation bordering on slavery and forced labour has developed in these regions, with workers being recruited clandestinely from other parts of the country to break the strikes called by the regular workers belonging to FETAPE.\n.The complainants explained that following a general strike in  the , rural workers of the sugar cane growing area secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From  to  other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the labour court and the workers became aware that they could take legal action to have them enforced. As from , however, the employers began to sabotage the agreements by recruiting huge numbers of unemployed labour from the drought-stricken areas of Sertao and Agreste. They got rid of the regular workers and replaced them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from those areas. After the harvest, these workers returned to their home districts and had no way of demanding that their rights be respected before a labour court.\n.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation which, after the  elections, relaxed its supervision. In order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers from the Meta area, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or tripling the daily volume of work provided for in the collective agreements. They brought private militia onto the sugar plantations, armed with revolvers and rifles, to ""pay a visit"" on the inhabitants and ""supervise"" the payment of the workers. Some workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; the land was laid waste and turned into cane-fields. The employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the labour standards stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting union dues from their pay. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations and punished workers who, as union delegates, attempted to keep in touch with their union. Some whose names were communicated by CONTAG and the ICFTU received death threats, were locked up in private prisons or were even assassinated, especially in the Goias area.\n.In the State of Sao Paulo the FTIC is unable to organise the workers of the state alcohol distilleries and is being prevented from establishing occupational associations that could subsequently become trade uninons. In Gantus , for instance, an agro-industrial enterprise with a distillery in Tupa, the employer has circulated a petition among the staff stating that the workers recognise that the enterprise is well run and rejecting the ""inopportune"" remarks of Pedro GonUales da Silva, a union leader responsible for unionisation in the State of Sao Paulo. The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.\n.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers\' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country\'s land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic\'s solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.\n.The Government notes that in May  collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed. It encloses a copy of the agreements between the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo and the Federation of Agricultural Workers, the Sugar Industries\' Trade Union and the Alcohol Industries\' Trade Union of the State of Sao Paulo. It adds that the Ministry of Labour has decided to set up a special group to enforce the agreements and encloses a copy of the relevant Decree No.  of  March . The Decree specifies that the special group is to be tripartite and must submit its first conclusions and recommendations within  days of the entry into force of the collective agreements. A collective agreement was signed on l September l between the rural workers and sugar cane plantation employers in the East of Pernambuco.\n.In addition, on  September  the Ministry of Labour set up a special tripartite committee to examine complaints of infringements of freedom of association made against the Government of Brazil through the ILO. The committee was required to submit its conclusions to the Labour Rights Commission of the Ministry of Labour. The tripartite committee met on  January  and concluded that the facts that had been denounced were of the utmost gravity. They concern the assassination of rural workers, death threats, acts of violence against rural workers and union leaders, the holding of persons in private prisons, the existence of private militias, the practice of torture by the federal police of Goias, attacks and other violations of human rights. The committee concluded that it could not reach any conclusion without concrete information as to whether or not steps had been taken by the competent authorities to deal with each complaint, how far the inquiries had advanced and whether the State Prosecutor\'s office had been informed. The committee therefore asked the Ministry of Labour\'s legal adviser to request the Office of the Ministry of Justice for detailed information on each case. Thereafter, on  March , the Minister of Labour requested the Minister of Justice to investigate all the complaints submitted in Case No. . As soon as it has received the necessary information on this case, the committee will be in a position to reach definitive conclusions.\n.With respect to Case No. , the regional labour delegation of the State of Sao Paulo has called for an investigation of the matter. This delegation indicated that on  August l the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries accepted that the matter was now closed. The Government attaches to its reply communication No. .-./, signed on  August l by the said Federation, from which it appears that the conflict which had developed at the TUPA-SP enterprise had been resolved.\n.The Committee observes that the complaints were submitted prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . Nevertheless, they contain extremely serious allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo and in alcohol distilleries. The allegations refer to the banning of trade union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and the assassination of union leaders.\n.The Committee has noted the very specific information submitted by the Government', "".The allegations presented by complainants in these two cases werecontained in the following communications: from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  June and  November \n.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Rightto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its initial complaint of  June , the ICFTU explains thatworkers in the service of the State launched several protest actions at thenational level in April  against Government Decree No.  of freezing for two months (April-May) the salaries of federal public employeesand of workers in state enterprises. In view of the Government's refusal toenter into discussions with the trade unions, the trade union organisations inthe public sector and state enterprises decided to call a -hour strike on \n.The ICFTU goes on to say that the strike was called by  trade unionorganisations, representing  / million workers, and that it paralysed fullyor partly all the sectors affected by the Decree, namely oil, metallurgy, theports, electricity, chemicals, banks, railways, mining and telephones. Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees. On  May the co-ordinating committee requested a meeting with theMinisters of Labour and of the Economy.

Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees.

The complainant organisation provided additional information in support of its complaint in a communication of  November .\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  October  and  January .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise in Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).\n.In its complaint, the ICFTU explains that its affiliate organisation in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL), organised, together with other national trade union confederations, a peaceful  hour strike on  September  with a view to doubling the basic subsistence wage and condemning the Government\'s economic and social policy. Fifteen trade unionists were arrested on that day, including Julio Chang Crespo, Secretary-General of the CEOSL and member of the Executive Committee of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (ORIT), a regional organisation belonging to the ICFTU. The ICFTU states that it supports its affiliate organisation\'s claims for wage increases and the repeal of governmental economic and social measures.\n.Together with its communication of  November , the ICFTU encloses a report from its affiliate, the CEOSL, on the causes which gave rise to the national general strike called by the Ecuadorian trade union movement and the course it took. The CEOSL explains in this document that the Government has carried out a policy aimed at giving a boost to exporters of agricultural products, banks and large undertakings at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises, resulting in the worsening of the social and economic situation of the majority of the population. This policy has brought about, for instance, price increases in stable commodities, public services (transport, electricity, water and telephones) and medicines, the freezing of budgetary expenditure for education and an increase in unemployment and underemployment.\n.According to the CEOSL, the Government systematically infringes Conventions Nos.  and  and the right to strike. For example, it refuses to register trade union executives which have been democratically and legally elected and to approve the rules of new organisations by laying down administrative requirements not stipulated by law. The CEOSL quotes the case of several trade unions who have been confronted with such difficulties (the Ecuadorian Railway Workers Union, the Works\' Council of Cubiertas and Mzov S.A., the Federation of Free Workers in the Ecuadorian Sugar Sector, the Santa Elena Agricultural Workers\' Trade Union).\n.As regards collective bargaining, the CEOSL states that collective agreements are not applied either in the public or in the private sector; bargaining is obstructed and agreements negotiated with public undertakings or bodies are challenged by the Ministry of Finance. In many cases, according to the CEOSL, strikers are subjected to police repression although the strikes have been called in strict conformity with the law.\n.The CEOSL also points out that the Executive does not apply the decisions adopted by the National Congress. For instance, the Government submitted a Bill to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to  US dollars ) accompanied by a tax programme to finance the wage increase. The Congress refused this Bill on the grounds that the increase was derisory. The Executive nevertheless, implemented this Bill, refusing to apply the Congress\'s decision to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to . US dollars).\n.According to the CEOSL, the President of the Republic also approved an Executive Decree restricting the right to call solidarity strikes, which is contrary to Ecuadorian law. This Decree, of which the CEOSL provides a copy, limits solidarity strikes to five days, stipulating that they may not be called upon more than twice in one year by workers in the same undertaking. The CEOSL has lodged an appeal against this Decree with the Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees.\n.In these circumstances, the national trade union confederations called a national strike on  September , in which wide sectors of the economy throughout the country took part. This movement was harshly put down by the police which, according to the CEOSL, arrested about  workers.\n.The CEOSL headquarters were also brutally attacked by the police and the trade unionists inside were dealt blows.\n.In its communications of  and  October , the Government states that Julio Chang Crespo, mentioned in the ICFTU\'s complaint, was arrested on  September  and sentenced to two-days\' imprisonment for breach of the peace and not for having exercised the right to strike, which is legally recognised. The person in question was released on  September and, two days later, left the country to attend a trade union meeting being held in Buenos Aires.\n.The Government adds that strikes linked to industrial disputes are protected by the Ecuadorian legal system but that, on the other hand, collective work stoppages and political strikes are specifically banned by Act No.  adopted by the National Assembly in . Under this Act, a collective work stoppage is defined as being the collective cessation of activity, the imposing of a lock-out outside the cases allowed by law, the paralysis of lines of communication and other similar anti-social occurrences. The instigators and authors of such stoppages are liable to a fine of , to , sucres and to two- to five-years\' imprisonment; those taking part in the work stoppage are liable to a fine of  to , sucres and to three-months\' to one-year\'s imprisonment. In its communications issued before the strike, the Government informed the population that this Act was still fully in force.\n.In the text of the sentence handed down by the Sixth Police Court on the persons arrested on  September , it is stated that those concerned took part in demonstrations not authorised by the police, which disrupted law and order and blocked the public highway, and that they shouted protests against the Government and public officials. In accordance with section , paragraph  of the Penal Code, they were sentenced to two days\' imprisonment.\n.The Government also encloses press cuttings containing statements by the Minister of Labour to the effect that the strike of  September was of a political nature and attempted to destabilise the regime.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government considers that the critisisms levelled by the complainants at the economic and social policy conducted in Ecuador are merely subjective statements of an arbitrary nature and divorced from reality. Admittedly, like many developing countries, Ecuador is undergoing a crisis, but the Government is attempting to ensure that the nation overcomes it unscathed and with the least social and political consequences. It is incumbent upon the public authorities to guarantee peace in the country and uphold national law and order.\n.The Government strongly denies the allegation that, by controlling the seditious actions of  September, it infringed ILO Conventions Nos.  and . It widely respects trade union rights and guarantees the exercise of these rights provided that this is lawful and moral and does not infringe legislation or disrupt law and order. The ""general strike"" of  September, wrongly described as ""peaceful"", was neither of a social nor trade union nature but was a seditious act: groups of rioters set up barricades in the streets and on the highways, caused fires, attacked members of the police force and private and official vehicles, damaged private property and injured individuals. The Government was prudent in the way it controlled the situation. Only several people actually instigating the disturbances or involved in violent action were arrested after being caught in the act. These agitators, who were imprisoned, were immediately released once the disturbances had ended and after serving a very short sentence of two-days\' imprisonment, in accordance with the penalties for offences laid down in the Penal Code. The only reason behind all the international proceedings was therefore to prolong a meticulously organised scandal and to exaggerate the importance of incidents brought rapidly brought under control. According to the Government, even an opposition paper described the general strike as being political. Furthermore, the Government points out that the so-called ""evidence"" of the ""repression"" carried out by the Government consists of cuttings from this same opposition paper.\n.The Government quotes several articles from the National Constitution: article , which lays down the functions and duties of the President of the Republic, including the upholding of national law and order, the use of the police force when security and public services warrant this and the declaration of the national state of emergency; article , which states that the role of the police force is to uphold national sovereignty, defend the integrity and independence of the nation and to guarantee its judicial system. The Government also provides a copy of the provisions of the Penal Code pertaining to offences against national state security. The Government points out that the rights of the individual and of society are protected by Ecuadorian legislation, in particular by Title II of the Constitution, of which it provides a copy.\n.The Government adds that', ""of Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, and to request it once more to indicate the present position of Mr. Julio Ayala Serra;(c) to draw attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  with respect to strikes in the teaching profession and the dissolution of the National Union of Educators (UNE), and to request the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE, which is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Ecuador), and supply information on any development in this connection;(d) to take note of this interim report.\n.The complaints are contained in two communications, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated  July , and the other from the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  July . The CPUSTAL supplied additional information in a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September . On  October  the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions submitted a complaint concerning which the Government has not yet transmitted its observations.\n.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CPUSTAL alleged that the Police Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of non-existent laws, had pronounced judgement sentencing to two years' imprisonment, and fines of from , to , sucres, the President of the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), Juan Vasquez Bastidas, and the President of the National Union of Educators (UNE), Manuel Anton. These organisations are members of the CPUSTAL. The complainants added that these persons had not been given any sort of trial.\n.The WFTU stated that the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL - had organised, on  May , a -hour national strike in support of a claim for higher wages and other demands of an economic and social nature. The UNE, which has a membership of , teachers, called a work stoppage on the same day with a view to obtaining a salary rise and an increase in the national education budget. In response, added the WFTU, the Government issued a decree, No. , conferring upon police intendants the status of special judges competent to try trade union officials and strikers under an expeditious procedure with no right of appeal. At the same time the Government instructed these police intendants to bring to trial the principal leaders of the three Confederations that had organised the national strike of  May, as well as officials of the UNE.\n.Furthermore, continued the complainants, the Supreme Council of Government issued on  May  a decree outlawing the UNE and providing for the custodianship of its funds. At the end of June, the General Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of the aforementioned Decree No. , sentenced Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton to fines and imprisonment. The WFTU further mentioned the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guays who was to be tried under the same procedure.\n.The Government, in a detailed reply to which were appended a large number of documents, emphasised that it was its policy to encourage the trade union movement in Ecuador. As evidence of this it pointed to the subsidy of , sucres that it paid to the country's trade union Confederations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, to cover the expenses of the  May rally. However, it continued, the leaders of these three Confederations had taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by this event - in which the majority of the participants had no connection with the trade union movement - to incite the workers to take part in a national work stoppage on  May , based on a combat manifesto of nine points, not all of which related to industrial matters, and which were refuted one by one. Moreover, none of these demands had been put to the competent authorities through the proper legal channels.\n.In the appendices to the Government's reply there was a list of these points and the arguments whereby the Government refuted them. These demands were as follows:\n.The Government stated that the union leaders were allowed to prepare for the work stoppage in full freedom. They had access to the radio, television and the press at the national level. The Government further pointed out that it had recognised the workers' organisations without reservations. However, it could not fail in its moral and legal duty to preserve public order and ensure that citizens could live their lives normally in every respect. It could only condemn incitement to disorderly conduct and anarchy, whoever was responsible, and any attempt to undermine the functioning of the State by disregarding the procedures in force for dealing with all grievances, individual or collective. In substance, the Government enforced the regulations in force to defend its stability and ensure the preservation of public order and the safety of persons and property. It was these duties that the Government was performing in dealing with the events of  May .\n.The Government refuted the complainants' allegations completely. It claimed that these complaints were unfounded and did not mention a single specific case of infringement of the freedom of association Conventions. All persons living on the territory of a State, added the Government, were required to observe the laws of that country. Under Legislative Decree No.  of  June , the instigators of a collective stoppage of work, and the ringleaders of such a stoppage, were liable to a fine of from , to , sucres and from two to five years' imprisonment. Persons who participated in such a work stoppage without having instigated it or being a ringleader were liable to a fine of from  to , sucres and from three months' to one year's imprisonment. A work stoppage within the meaning of this legislative decree was deemed to occur where there was a collective cessation of activity, where establishments were forcibly closed other than in the circumstances provided for by law, and in the event of paralysis of channels of communication or other anti social acts. These provisions had the force of a special Act and had precedence over those of general Acts which were contrary to them.\n.The strike of  May , continued the Government, had been prepared, inter alia, by Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Emilio Velasco and Jos Chvez Chvez, officials of one or other of the workers' associations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, while other unions (bearing the same initials) had refused to be associated with the stoppage and had condemned it as an act of treason by the rank and file, requesting the support of the authorities to enable them to carry on with their daily work. The above-mentioned persons, in instigating the strike, had contravened Legislative Decree No .\n.This Legislative Decree, added the Government, was supplemented by Presidential Decree No. , which specified the competent judicial authority and guarantees the rights of defendants. There accordingly existed a judicial institution, established by the State, to mete out punishment in the case of work stoppages and strikes organised unlawfully. The Government appended the text of this decree, adopted on  May . Section  confers upon general police intendants the status of special judges competent to deal with and pronounce judgement upon offences in connection with collective work stoppages; they must impose the penalties prescribed in Legislative Decree No. . Section  states that the procedure is to be that prescribed in section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure; sections , ,  and  of that Code are likewise to be observed. Section  specifies that special judges may, either on their own initiative or at the request of any administrative or judicial authority, take up a case and try the persons held to be criminally responsible for a collective work stoppage.\n.The judgements handed down in respect of Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, concluded the Government, had been pronounced in accordance with the legal rules in force in the country and the penalties had been imposed by the legally competent authority. There could, therefore, be no question as to the validity of their conviction.\n.This case is mainly concerned with the general strike called on  May  by the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL and another strike organised on the same day by the UNE. This work stoppage resulted in the sentencing, under an emergency procedure, of trade union leaders including Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton. The complainants also mention the arrest of another trade union leader, Julio Ayala Serra, and the outlawing of the UNE, but the Government has made no observations on the latter two points.\n.As already pointed out by the Committee, Article  of Convention No.  recognises the right of trade union organisations"", '.The Committee on Freedom of Association examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see rd Report, paragraphs  to ), which was approved at its th Session (November ).\n.The Government sent additional information on the outstanding allegations in a communication dated  December .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government concerning this case, in particular that Julio Chang Crespo, the trade union officer who is the subject of this complaint, and other trade unionists have been released after serving a sentence of two days\' imprisonment handed down by the trial judge for disseminating false information and rumours concerning the order currently prevailing in Ecuadorian society and for offending national honour. The sentence accords with the provisions of section () of the Ecuadorian Penal Code.\n.The Committee would nevertheless recall the principle that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas and to this end workers, employers and their organisations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. However, the Committee recalls in general terms that in expressing their opinions trade union organisations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language. (See th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. (f).)\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee notes that Julio Chang Crespo and the other trade unionists who are the subject of this complaint have been released after being sentenced to two days\' imprisonment. The Committee further considers that the matter does not call for further examination.\n.In a communication dated  March , the ICFTU submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Ecuador.\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  March , the ICFTU explains that its affiliate organisation in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL), together with other national trade union confederations, called a national strike on  March  to protest against the excessive increase in fuel prices and transport costs. According to the ICFTU, the Government, on the grounds of this national strike, ordered the arrest of the Secretary-General of the CEOSL, Julio Chang and other trade unionists.\n.In its communication of  July , the Government points out that on  and  March , there were three serious earthquakes which affected a large part of the country, resulting in loss of life and property and bringing oil production (the country\'s major trade export) to a halt, as a large stretch of the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline was destroyed; this caused a sudden situation in which the national economy threatened to collapse. The Government, the communication continues, coped with the emergency situation as best it could to ensure that the country could continue functioning in spite of the immediate consequences of the disaster.\n.The Government adds that, in view of the disasterous situation which had occurred and which threatened to paralyse the national economy, it was bound, in fulfilling its obligations to govern, to take some measures to create emergency resources (so to be able to pay the salaries of public servants, amongst other things) and improve the capacity of the remaining system of production. As part of these measures, it was necessary to raise the price of petrol to the equivalent of  American cents or  Swiss centimes per gallon ( litres), i.e.  American cents or  Swiss centimes per litre. Furthermore, it was vital to release foreign currency and float the bank interest rate, because the State was incapable of continuing to subsidise exchange rates and the fixed interest rate.\n.The Government\'s communication adds that confronted with this situation, the ""executive"" of the trade union confederations did not adopt a responsible attitude. Mr. Fausto Dutn, substitute member of the National Congress, representing the Broad Left Front (FADI), took over the presidency of the Workers\' Unitarian Front (FUT) and announced the list of claims of the forthcoming strike which advocated: i)there should be no payment of the foreign debt; (ii) the oil industry should be nationalised; (iii) primary commodities should only be marketed by ENAC and ENPROVIT (state marketing enterprises) in order to maintain a price balance; (iv) land should be handed over to the peasants. Furthermore, it demanded that the Head of State should be put on trial and resign and that the decision to increase fuel prices should be revoked.\n.The Government points out that this case has nothing to do with a ""strike"", because in Ecuadorian labour law a strike means ""a collective suspension of work by employees acting in combination""; a strike is authorised ""if a dispute arises between an employer and his employees"", and this is submitted to the conciliation and arbitration tribunal. It may only be declared in the following cases: ""() if the employer, after being notified of the employees\' demands, fails to reply within the statutory time or gives a negative reply; () if the employer, after being notified, dismisses or gives notice of dismissal to one or more employees, or gives notice of the termination of an agreement ..."", except ""in the case of the dismissal of an employee who has committed an act of violence against the property of the undertaking or factory or against the person of the employer or his agent; () if no conciliation and arbitration tribunal is appointed within the time specified in section  or if, having been appointed, the tribunal for any reason does not meet within three days of its appointment, on condition in either case that the failure is not the fault of the members designated by the employees; () if conciliation proves impossible or no award is issued within the time allowed by section "". Strikes are only guaranteed by the Constitution and the Labour Code subject to these conditions. However, this concept of strike action is so wide that it authorises strikers to remain in the factories, workshops or workplaces concerned (unique in world labour legislation), under police protection against the entry of agitators and strike breakers; it entitles strikers to receive remuneration and authorises solidarity strikes: ""The law also recognises the right to strike where the object is to support a lawful strike declared by the employees of another undertaking."" A lawful general strike might arise because employees in one undertaking support a strike in another undertaking, which is being conducted in accordance with the law, and this spreads to all undertakings throughout the country.\n.But this is not the case here, the Government continues in its communication, because on  March  political leaders of various opposition parties illegally interpreted ""freedom of association"" in their own way. These same political leaders head trade union confederations grouped together in the Workers\' Unitarian Front, whilst also participating in the Ecuadorian Revolutionary Youth Movement, the Workers\' Revolutionary Movement, the General Union of Workers or the Popular Front. Similarly, they collaborate with these real or fictitious organisations, with the FEUE and the UNE and various clandestine groups who are openly committed to violence. These persons, in interpreting freedom of association in their own way, prevented the free movement of vehicles and pedestrians and normal activities within the city by raising obstacles and barricades in the streets, destroying traffic signs, public clocks and rubbish bins and tearing up the paving on the streets.\n.The Government\'s communication also describes the outcome of the above-mentioned strike; in particular, it notes that: citizens and members of the police and their vehicles were stoned; tyres were burnt, in Esmeralda, stores and private houses were stormed and several establishments burnt; in Quito, as a result of the storming of the Hotel Coln Internacional and the Finance Corporation with incendiary bombs, there was a threat of fire in the first floors of the hotel and the windows of both buildings were shattered; the premises of the Employers\' and Workers\' Association of the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources were attacked with incendiary bombs; and in Quito, an incendiary bomb was thrown at a van transporting a group of young conscripts doing their national military service, some of whom suffered injuries and burns. In the capital city, the strikers killed hundreds of dogs, scorching them in the fire and then hanging them from the branches of trees and on lamp-posts. At the end of the day of  March, the strikers declared that the ""tenth general strike"" organised by the FUT had been ""victorious"". Several FUT officials tried,']"

Workers belonging to ASPA enjoy the same rights as members of STIAS, even though they are not part of the latter union, which holds the signing rights for the collective labour agreement (article  of the Federal Labour Law).\n.The Government states that ASPA applied to AVIACSA and STIAS for the right to sign the collective labour agreement on behalf of pilots on  March . The case was turned over to Special Council No.  of the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration under case No. IV-/. The application by the Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic was later added, since it sought the right to sign the same collective labour agreement.\n.The Council ordered a trial ballot among the entire AVIACSA workforce. It was held on  August . ASPA received no votes.\n.It is emphasized that  workers voted, including  pilots of the total of  pilots actively working for AVIACSA.\n.The collective labour agreement concluded with STIAS covers all labour issues affecting the AVIACSA workforce. While article , Section III of the Federal Labour Law provides for the hypothetical occurrence of competition between occupational and enterprise or industrial trade unions, the hypothesis is not applicable where there is an existing agreement covering all labour relations.\n.The Council pronounced final judgement on  October  to the effect that ASPA s case was dismissed and the defence of AVIACSA and STIAS was upheld. The respondents were absolved of all of the claims by ASPA and the Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic. ASPA applied for leave to appeal against the final judgement to the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Labour of the First Circuit and was granted leave to appeal in order first to resolve the dispute surrounding the trial ballots proposed by the parties before such a ballot be conducted. The dispute centres around the fact that AVIACSA and STIAS propose to ballot the entire AVIACSA workforce, while ASPA would ballot only the pilots. The Council fulfilled the appeal judgement through an agreement dated  May  in which it settled the dispute surrounding the ballot. After analysing the evidence put forward by the parties, the Council decided that, since a collective labour agreement was already registered with an industrial trade union and covered all the company s workforce, that existing collective agreement regulated all labour relations in the relevant company under the terms of article  of the Federal Labour Law. The Council also considers that, while article , section III of the Federal Labour Law provides for the hypothetical occurrence of competition between occupational and enterprise or industrial trade unions in the conclusion of a collective labour agreement, where, as in this case, there is an existing agreement covering all labour relations, it is essential to ballot all workers and not only the members of the pilots\' trade union. Failure to follow this procedure would be a violation of the rights not only of the members of STIAS, which concluded the collective labour agreement, but of those of every worker in the service of AVIACSA. The Council also noted that the ballot was undoubtedly the ideal test of which organization should be accredited to conclude and administer the collective labour agreement, for which the successful union would need to demonstrate that it had the majority support both of the trade union members and of the remaining workers at the company.\n.The Council announced a new date,  June , for the balloting of all workers. ASPA did not obtain any votes in the ballot. STIAS obtained  votes and the Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic obtained one vote.\n.As regards the five claims of unfair dismissal, the Government states that they were submitted to the labour authorities by Emilio Zrate Gonzlez, Ari Rafael Rose Errejn, Mario Rafael Escalera Crdenas, Marcos Guillermo Mendoza Escobar and Gerardo Serrato Sala and are still being examined by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, and therefore it has not yet been established whether they were dismissed unjustly or whether the reason was their trade union activities.\n.As regards ASPA s claim that the High Court of Justice declared illegal the rule set by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, namely that the right to sign a collective agreement could not be claimed on behalf of a specific occupational group, but only on behalf of all categories covered under the agreement, the Government states that the collegiate tribunals of the labour circuit that deal with appeals against final rulings by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration are not qualified to ""declare illegal the rules"" of the Council. Their competence extends to upholding or rejecting the complainant s appeal against specific acts of authority that are perceived to violate his individual constitutional rights. The rulings of appeal cases refer only to the individuals that brought the case and are limited to providing them with recourse and protection, if appropriate, in the specific circumstances that motivated the appeal, without making a general declaration concerning the law or act that gave rise to it (article  of the Law on Recourse, regulating articles  and  of the Constitution of the United Mexican States). Contrary to ASPA s claim, the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration upheld the rule that all the workers at the company and to whom the collective labour agreement applied should be balloted. It is not sufficient for the union to gain the majority of votes from a single occupational group; it must take into account the votes of all workers covered by the collective labour agreement. The Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration has applied this rule in the airline industry and to all similar cases brought by occupational trade unions to obtain the right to sign collective labour agreements.\n.The Government emphasizes that there is no legal substance to the arguments that: (a) the collective agreement is breaking up of its own accord because each of the occupations to which it applies is governed by its own specific standards; (b) a collective agreement should be considered for each individual occupation; and (c) the AVIACSA collective agreement should be divided into three sections for the different occupations that it covers, each with its own field of application. As regards the argument that the AVIACSA pilots are not covered by the general provisions of the Federal Labour Law and enjoy special working conditions because they are governed by standards applicable exclusively to their profession, the Federal Labour Law establishes the working conditions for all workers, including pilots, and its Chapter IV lays down special provisions for the ""work of air crew"". Pilots are governed by the provisions of Chapter IV and the general provisions of the Federal Labour Law.\n.Finally, the Government states that, during the legal dispute over the right to sign the AVIACSA collective labour agreement, ASPA has been able to exercise its rights under the law and have recourse to remedies against the resolutions by which it considered itself affected. The issue that has been brought before the ILO is still sub judice before the national judicial bodies and this could affect the process before the Mexican courts pronounce. Moreover, if the federal legal authorities uphold ASPA s case, this communication will be groundless.\n.To conclude, the Government has acted in accordance with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining established by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO in the sphere of exclusive bargaining rights:- There is an objective and previously established criterion, the balloting procedure contained in article  of the Federal Labour Law, to determine the right to sign the collective labour agreement.- Special Council No. , respecting the principle of ""the most representative organization"" contained in article , paragraph , of the ILO Constitution, ordered a ballot among the entire AVIACSA workforce to determine which trade union had the right to sign the collective labour agreement.- The balloting procedure was carried out before Special Council No. , which is an independent body, with tripartite membership.- ASPA freely exercised its right to seek the right to sign the collective labour agreement.- STIAS obtained the majority of the votes in the two ballots:  votes in the first and  in the second. The Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic obtained one vote each time and the Trade Union Association of Airline Pilots of Mexico (ASPA) received no votes. Hence, the most representative trade union was selected on the basis of the vote of the majority of the workers in the', 'as No. IV-/. At the hearing, ASPA confirmed its request and evidence, indicating the issues that needed to be addressed and stating the justification for a ballot to be held among the pilots alone, pointing to similar cases, such as those of AEROCANCUN, SARO and AEROMEXPRESS. The respondents, for their part, contested the application and produced their own evidence; they argued that the ballot should include all of the company s workers. They also stated that ASPA did not have the authority to take over from an industrial trade union the collective agreement for an occupational group when the collective labour agreement was indivisible. ASPA s application was accompanied by another, submitted by a different trade union and processed as No. IV-/. On  August , the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration issued a ruling that the trial ballot should be held on  August  and cover the entire AVIACSA workforce, including pilots, cabin crew, mechanics and other ground crew and rejecting ASPA s proposal for an occupational ballot for pilots only. Given the illegal nature of such a company-wide ballot and the impossibility of winning (even if the majority of pilots voted for ASPA it would lose the case because it would not have the overall majority of votes, and if the majority of the company s workforce voted for ASPA it would also lose, because it only covers pilots and cannot offer membership to other categories). ASPA decided not to support the ballot and instructed pilots not to vote, or, if they did, to give their vote to another union in order to avoid being dismissed unjustly.\n.It adds that, following ASPA s decision to apply for a collective agreement for pilots at AVIACSA, a number of pilots had been unfairly dismissed purely because they supported ASPA, including Captain Emilio Alberto Zrate Gonzlez, Captain Andrs Flores Lpez, Captain Gerardo Gorra Carmona, Captain Ismael Cruz Romn, Captain Marcos Guillermo Mendoza Escobar, Captain Luis Fernando del Ro Leal, Captain Manuel Tostado Almazn, Captain Jos Eduardo Rodrguez Normanda, Captain Gerardo Serrato Sala, Captain Jorge Eduardo Moreno Aguirre, Captain Ari Rafael Rose Errejn and Captain Mario Rafael Escalera Crdenas. As a consequence of the unfair dismissals, individual appeals against dismissal were lodged and are being processed by Special Council No.  of the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration under case numbers /, /, /, / and /.\n.The complainant states that, on  October , the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration absolved the respondents of ASPA s demand to be allowed to conclude a collective agreement, ruling that it was not appropriate for the pilots of AVIACSA to have their own collective agreement. ASPA disagreed and launched an appeal, which was upheld by the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Labour of the First Circuit in document DT /. In granting the appeal and the protection of federal justice on  May , it ordered the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration not to execute the ruling of  October  and to disregard the results of the ballot held on  August . It ruled that a new ballot should be held because of the illegality of the ballot for the entire AVIACSA workforce. Article  of the Federal Labour Law provides that, in the conclusion of collective labour agreements within a company, there may be both an industrial and an occupational trade union involved and that a collective agreement should be signed with the occupational trade union for its members and with the other trade union for the remaining categories of workers. Article , for its part, stipulates that the loss of the majority referred to in article  entails the loss of the collective labour agreement. The provisions of article  read as follows:Article . ... III. If occupational and enterprise or industrial trade unions are competing, the occupational trade unions shall be allowed to conclude a collective agreement for their occupational group, as long as the number of their members is greater than that of workers in the same occupational group holding membership of the enterprise or industrial trade union.\n.Article  provides that:The loss of the majority referred to by the previous article, as declared by the Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, entails the loss of the collective labour agreement.The Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration applied the principles contained in articles  and  of the Federal Labour Law and it was hence taken that, where conflicts over the right to sign the collective agreement arose because an occupational trade union wished to take over from an industrial union the professional representation of a given category, it was appropriate to take action. In recognition of the greater professional interest of the occupational trade union, it was decided to hold an occupational ballot in which only the members of the disputed category would participate. That rule had been applied by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration in all such conflicts over the right to sign in the airline industry, where, because of the industry s special nature, workers were organized in occupational unions on the basis of a natural division of activities.\n.The complainant states that the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration suddenly amended its rules for the airline industry. In order to protect the unions favoured by the employers and the employers themselves, and since the current collective agreements were of a company-wide nature, it adopted a new rule, namely that the right to sign a collective agreement could not be claimed on behalf of a specific occupational group, but only on behalf of all categories covered under the agreement, which left the occupational trade unions without any rights at all. However, this rule, put forward by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, was declared illegal by the High Court of Justice, which ruled that it was appropriate for an occupational trade union to claim from an industrial trade union the right to sign the collective agreement on behalf of a specific occupational group and that the trial ballot should be held only among the workers in that category.\n.Despite the fact that ASPA s appeal was upheld and it was deemed illegal to hold a company-wide ballot on a conflict over the right to sign on behalf of only one occupational group, on  May  the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration once again ordered a general ballot, to be held on  June , dismissing ASPA s representations to the effect that an occupational ballot should be held for pilots only.\n.In every country, airline-industry workers are organized into occupational trade unions corresponding to the different occupational groups, namely ground crew, cabin crew and pilots. This is the general rule because each of these occupations has its own features, on the basis of which its workers have sought to organize their own unions, and the respective unions are affiliated to international federations for each of the relevant occupations. In the case of pilots, both in the Americas and in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Pacific Rim, there are occupational unions, which in turn belong to supra-national organizations of a regional or global nature, such as the OIP or IFALPA.\n.In its communications dated  October  and  March , the Government states that, according to the Trade Union Association of Airline Pilots of Mexico (ASPA), the alleged violation took place during the legal case over the right to sign the collective agreement, brought against Consorcio Aviaxsa, S.A. de C.V. (AVIACSA) and the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS).\n.It adds that the events related by ASPA took place during the legal dispute over the right to sign a collective agreement, and, as such, fall under the provisions governing collective bargaining rights contained in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has not been ratified by Mexico.\n.In connection with the dispute, the Government states that on  March  AVIACSA concluded a collective labour agreement with STIAS in order to regulate worker-employer relations, which, according to the agreement, should be conducted through a trade union. The clauses of the contract were applicable to all AVIACSA workers. The only distinction drawn among workers was the basic salary payable to each category. The latest version of the salary scale contained  different post types.\n.The Government adds that, on  March , an agreement was concluded on the revision of the salaries contained in the collective labour agreement between AVIACSA and STIAS. This established the categories of ground crew and air crew and laid down different working conditions for each category. The only reference to grades of workers is in the scale of minimum salaries payable according to post, which includes different types of pilots.\n.The collective labour agreement between AVIACSA and STIAS and the salary revision agreement were not divided into occupations. The salary revision agreement drew a distinction between ground crew and air crew in order to be able to provide benefits over and', "".At its meeting in November , the Committee formulated conclusions on an allegation that had remained pending in relation to this case and refers to the dismissal of members of ASPA. The complainant (ASPA) had alleged in June  that, following ASPA s decision to demand a collective agreement for AVIACSA pilots, a number of pilots had been unfairly dismissed only because they supported ASPA, including Captain Emilio Alberto Zrate Gonzlez, Captain Andrs Flores Lpez, Captain Gerardo Gorra Carmona, Captain Ismael Cruz Romn, Captain Marcos Guillermo Mendoza Escobar, Captain Luis Fernando del Ro Leal, Captain Manuel Tostado Almazn, Captain Jos Eduardo Rodrguez Normanda, Captain Gerardo Serrato Sala, Captain Jorge Eduardo Moreno Aguirre, Captain Ari Rafael Rose Errejn and Captain Mario Rafael Escalera Crdenas. As a consequence of the unfair dismissals, individual appeals against dismissal were lodged and are being processed by Special Council No.  of the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration under case numbers /, /, /, / and / [see the Committee s th Report, para. ]. In June , ASPA alleged that the company again dismissed more pilots between April and May  for voting in favour of ASPA at the most recent ballot on  March  [see the th Report, para. ]. At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see the th Report, para. ]:As regards the dismissals of the ASPA members referred to by the Committee in its previous examination of the case, the Committee observes that the judicial proceedings are still pending. The Committee requests the Government to take the appropriate measures to ensure that those proceedings are concluded as quickly as possible and, if the anti-union nature thereof is proven, that the dismissed workers are reinstated immediately, without loss of pay. In addition, the Committee notes with concern the allegations relating to the dismissal of new workers for voting in favour of the ASPA trade union organization. The Committee notes the high number of dismissals in the context of a collective bargaining dispute and that the Government merely points out the existence of the possibility of taking legal action. The Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the relevant inquiries are conducted immediately and, if the anti-union nature of these latest dismissals is proven, to consider the possibility of ensuring the reinstatement of these workers as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government supplied information on the status of the cases relating to the  individuals named by the complainants that are currently being examined by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration (a jurisdictional body) and have not yet been concluded. The Government states that it is this Council that will have to rule on whether the workers were dismissed unjustifiably for their trade union activities. In its communication dated  February , the Government requests the complainant to indicate the court and the number of the file of any other cases of dismissal that have not been resolved.\n.Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of all of the cases relating to dismissals and hopes that judicial rulings will be handed down in the near future.\n.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the rulings issued in the proceedings initiated by a group of workers who had been dismissed for supporting the application by ASPA to conclude a collective labour agreement and, if it transpired that the dismissals had been due to legitimate trade union activity, to ensure that the workers concerned were reinstated in their posts, without loss of pay.\n.In a communication dated  June , the Trade Union Association of Airline Pilots of Mexico (ASPA) stated that the Consorcio Aviaxsa S.A. de C.V. (AVIACSA) company was continuing to disregard the right of airline pilots to negotiate collectively. It emphasizes that originally the collective agreement signed between the company and the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS) did not include airline pilots and that they were subsequently included without being consulted. The complainant organization reiterates that it enjoys a majority of votes from the pilots and as such it was appropriate for it to negotiate collectively, in accordance with the provisions of articles  and  of the Federal Labour Law. The complainant organization adds that, with a view to deciding definitively who enjoyed the majority, the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration ordered, on  February , that a new ballot should be held involving only the AVIACSA pilots. That ballot took place on  March . On that occasion, of  pilots who participated,  voted for ASPA and  for STIAS, but in the course of the ballot, the ballot list from Tijuana was stolen, and this was reported to the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic. Consequently, the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration ordered that the pilots who participated in the ballot in Tijuana should attend a hearing on  April  in order to confirm their votes. On that occasion, the complainant organization reports that various individuals hired by AVIACSA assaulted the members of ASPA, and this was reported to the criminal court.\n.In addition, the complainant organization alleges that the collective labour agreement between Consorcio Aviaxsa S.A. de C.V. (AVIACSA) and STIAS contains various clauses which violate the freedom of association. Clause  of the agreement states that if all or some of the workers of a particular speciality separate from or leave the union, they will be replaced by workers who are members of the union.\n.Finally, the complainant organization states that the company again dismissed more pilots in April and May  for voting in favour of ASPA at the last ballot on  March .\n.In a communication dated  September , the Government states that, in its last examination of the case, the Committee determined that, since the Government of Mexico had demonstrated that the most representative trade union in the AVIACSA company was the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS) (which signed the collective agreement in force), it does not appear that the principles of collective bargaining were violated by denying ASPA the right to negotiate a specific collective agreement for the pilots' group. The Committee emphasized that the system of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade union is compatible with the principle of freedom of association. This is a matter to be decided on the basis of national law and practice.\n.With respect to the contents of the collective labour agreement concluded between AVIACSA and the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS), the Government of Mexico states that it unfailingly respects the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, in accordance with articles  to  of the Federal Labour Law.\n.Such collective agreements must also cover the minimum labour standards laid down in section XXVII of article , paragraph A of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States and article  of the Federal Labour Law states that under no circumstances shall conditions of labour be inferior to those laid down in that law and shall be proportionate to the importance of the services in question and shall be the same for the same kinds of work.\n.The Government adds that, in any case, any worker who considers his rights to be violated, is entitled to take action to assert them according to the terms of the Federal Labour Law itself.\n.With regard to ASPA s assertion that it is incorrect that the ballots were general with the participation of the entire AVIACSA workforce, the Government points out that, since it demonstrated that a trade union with greater representativity existed in the AVIACSA company, it did not appear that the principles of collective bargaining had been violated by denying ASPA the right to negotiate a specific agreement for the pilots' group. In addition, the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Labour of the First Circuit, in the appeal brought by ASPA in case No. DT./, ordered solely the AVIACSA pilots to be balloted, making the previous ballot null and void. The Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, pursuant to the ruling of the Collegiate Tribunal, was obliged to comply and complied in full with the order, holding a new ballot on  March  exclusively for the pilots. The Collegiate Tribunal, in granting ASPA the right to appeal, did not rule on the substance of the problem. In no""]"

Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government assumed power on  March  to halt the deterioration in the trade union situation in Uruguay and restore democracy. The Committee intends to examine all these cases, which relate to a trade union situation that arose under the regime that came to power as a result of the military takeover in , in a single document.\n.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its letter of  August , the Government states that the process of institutionalising democracy, and therefore of remedying the trade union situation, began on  March . It recalls that it sent a representative to the May  meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments. The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before the Committee.\n.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.\n.The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the interested parties; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life of the country.(b) The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union situation.\n.When the Committee examined these cases at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations which were pending:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Cases Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt, in respect of whom it wished to be kept informed of any action taken) and that it has also expressed the hope that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of  trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused (Milton Morales - in detention, David Calleros, Jess Eguren, Jaime Lpez, Mara Martnez , Carlos Mechoso, Roberto Meirelles, Dimar Silva - all undergoing trial; Jorge Alvarez, Rubn Bello, Diego Brugnole, Jaime Bugarn, Julio Durante, Jos Glisenti, Carlos Goerrero, Miguel Guzmn, Yolanda Ibarra, Luis Iguini, Ral Larraya, Wilman Lasena, Francisco Laurenzo, Waldamar de Len, Len Lev, Miguel Longo, Francisco Maiorana, Guillermo Martiello, Leandro Moreira, Rogelio Ortiz, Norberto Quintana, Ramn R. Reyes, Toms Rivero, Washington Rodrguez Belleti, Hugo Rossi and Edgardo Torres - all sentenced), the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial and that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and constitute offences under ordinary law. However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for engaging in activities of a trade union character. It also requests that the Government supply information on this matter.\n.In its communications of  and  March  the Government states that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti is in hiding and that all the other persons mentioned by the complainants, with the exception of Rubn Bello and Len Lev (the latter of whom was sentenced for forgery) have been freed, some of them in application of the law of amnesty for political offences.\n.In connection with the allegations which remained pending, the Committee notes with satisfaction the release of  of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences. As regards the remaining three persons who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) are serving prison sentences (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that  of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced have now been released, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences.(b) As regards the three remaining persons, who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) have been sentenced to imprisonment (the latter for forgery). The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete facts serving as grounds for the sentences passed on the first two trade unionists mentioned in order to enable it to determine whether or not these sentences were based on trade union activities.\n.The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release to the ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and has also expressed its hope that the request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.\n.With reference to the list of  trade unionists who were detained, tried or sentenced and in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused, the Committee observes that the Government has indicated in a general manner the acts which led to their trial, and has indicated that the activities of which they were accused were undertaken for the benefit of the Communist Party. The Committee observes that some of these activities have no connection whatsoever with freedom of association and that they constitute offences under ordinary law (possession of weapons, forging of documents, use of false identity documents, attacks with rocket launchers, attacks on commercial premises, etc.). However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities regardless of whether they were calculated to favour the objectives of the Communist Party. This would seem to be the case, for example, with the collection of monetary contributions and the printing and distribution of leaflets. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for having engaged in activities of a trade union character. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on this matter.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists and that it has also expressed the hope"", "".On  August , the Government sent information on Cases Nos. , , , , ,  and  concerning allegations of infringements of freedom of association presented by numerous workers' organisations. Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government assumed power on  March  to halt the deterioration in the trade union situation in Uruguay and restore democracy. The Committee intends to examine all these cases, which relate to a trade union situation that arose under the regime that came to power as a result of the military takeover in , in a single document.\n.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its letter of  August , the Government states that the process of institutionalising democracy, and therefore of remedying the trade union situation, began on  March . It recalls that it sent a representative to the May  meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments. The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before the Committee.\n.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.\n.The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the interested parties; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life of the country.(b) The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union situation.\n.When the Committee examined these cases at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations which were pending:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Cases Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt, in respect of whom it wished to be kept informed of any action taken) and that it has also expressed the hope that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of  trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused (Milton Morales - in detention, David Calleros, Jess Eguren, Jaime Lpez, Mara Martnez , Carlos Mechoso, Roberto Meirelles, Dimar Silva - all undergoing trial; Jorge Alvarez, Rubn Bello, Diego Brugnole, Jaime Bugarn, Julio Durante, Jos Glisenti, Carlos Goerrero, Miguel Guzmn, Yolanda Ibarra, Luis Iguini, Ral Larraya, Wilman Lasena, Francisco Laurenzo, Waldamar de Len, Len Lev, Miguel Longo, Francisco Maiorana, Guillermo Martiello, Leandro Moreira, Rogelio Ortiz, Norberto Quintana, Ramn R.

The traditional practice in Uruguay has been to submit bilaterally negotiated collective agreements for ""confirmation"" by the wage councils, turning them into decisions to make them generally applicable. The very structure and independence of these bodies favoured this practice, which thus allowed a unique development of independence of the parties even within a tripartite framework. This was clearly shown by the proliferation of collective agreements approved in this way in the s. To a certain extent the expectations raised by the reopening of the wage councils in  went in this direction, as was confirmed by the practice followed in many of the councils. The Government, however, in violation of its obligations as laid down in international standards, has taken it upon itself to obstruct, make difficult and even prevent the development of negotiation between the social partners. At first it brought pressure to bear through its delegates in the wage councils so that agreements between employers and workers would conform to its guide-lines; it then refused to retain in its decrees the wage clauses which did not follow these guide-lines (as the ILO mission was able to observe (see its report, page )); lastly, it went as far as to refuse to recognise the validity of the ""medium- and long-term agreements"" which had not been confirmed by the Executive. (Decrees Nos. / and / prescribe as a condition for the validity of wage clauses in agreements drawn up in the wage councils, that the latter ""be confirmed by decree of the Executive Power"".) The Minister of the Economy himself stated before the Committee on Labour Affairs of the Senate of the Republic that ""obviously, the conditions laid down by the Executive Power shall be taken into account in deciding which agreements it is willing to confirm"".\n.The PIT-CNT adds that despite the express opposition of the trade union movement, section  of Legislative Decree No.  adopted during the dictatorship is still in force. This section provides that ""the Executive Power, jointly with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and, where appropriate, with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, may, if it considers it necessary and appropriate: ... (e) issue rules respecting wages and, in particular, establish occupational categories and regulate the remuneration of workers employed in the private sector"". These extensive powers assigned to the Executive run counter to the system of wage councils and to collective bargaining. The use of such powers to supplant the will of the parties to labour relations constitutes a practice in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , as it restricts the freedom of association and independence of the parties which these Conventions guarantee. Despite this, the Uruguayan Government has thus made increasing use of Legislative Decree No. , in blatant violation of international and national legislation, bringing unlawful pressure to bear on the entire system of collective labour relations and ensuring that it has the last word in fixing wages according to its own unilateral decisions of economic policy. A complete picture of this policy emerges from the decrees issued in February of the years ,  and  (/, / and /) by which general wage increases were fixed directly by the Executive without convening the wage councils and without taking any account of the opinions of the sides of industry. The Minister of the Economy has made the following statement: ""the Executive Power,"" said the highest exponent of the economic policy, ""apart from refusing to confirm some agreements, has not taken any measures beyond this, except for the periodical decision, adopted out of considerations of timeliness and appropriateness, to fix remuneration by decree. Obviously, the Executive Power does not renounce this machinery.""\n.As regards collective bargaining in the public administration, the PIT-CNT alleges that the Uruguayan Government prevents the development of collective bargaining in the public administration, whether in the central administration or in autonomous bodies and decentralised services. This is a failure to comply with Convention No. , which allows only public servants engaged in the administration of the State to be excluded from its scope. The Government has attempted to conceal its violation of international standards in this field by agreeing to meet with trade union organisations of public servants both of the central administration and of the autonomous bodies and services. However, the methods used have merely confirmed its ignorance of such standards in addition to violating the Constitution of the Republic itself. Thus, at the level of the central administration, the Government was represented by the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of the Economy and the Planning and Budget Office, which generally confined themselves to stating their own wage guide-lines. The complainant affirms categorically that this has nothing to do with genuine collective bargaining. Still worse is the situation in the autonomous bodies and decentralised services, because in this respect the Uruguayan Government has not only violated international standards but has also disregarded the independence of such bodies, enshrined in the Constitution, by refusing on several occasions to comply with the agreements reached between the directorates of these bodies and trade union organisations.\n.Starting from the beginning of June  the situation has worsened, if possible, in the public administration, both in the central administration and in the decentralised services and autonomous bodies. Thus, not even the sham negotiations which formerly took place have been opened. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that  June  was the deadline, the last time until , for drawing up the budget accounts, since no adjustments may be made in  which is an election year. This means that nearly half of all Uruguayan workers are not only prevented from participating in determining their wages, but also run the risk that for virtually two years they will have to submit to what the Government decides itself, in blatant violation of international Conventions and the most elementary democratic standards.\n.The PIT-CNT alleges further that on  December  the Puma Trading SA enterprise, which employs  workers, dismissed Messrs. Carlos Bez and Williams Maciel, members of the executive committee of the Trade Union of Manual and Office Workers of Puma (SOEP) in violation of the provisions of Convention No. . In support of its allegation, the PIT-CNT highlights the following indications of the anti-union nature of the dismissals: () in , labour-management relations became extremely difficult, being constantly obstructed by the employer; () the trade union leaders concerned were on the list of candidates for union elections which were to take place four days after the dismissal; () the dismissal cited ""grounds of improving the service"" as the persons involved ""failed to meet the general requirements of the enterprise""; () hearings held in the Ministry of Labour established the impossibility of technically justifying the grounds cited by the employer; () the work records of the persons dismissed were excellent, since they had met all the requirements for admission to the enterprise and for employment in an occupational category involving considerable responsibility; () the enterprise did not give any explanation of the reason it had chosen this particular time to carry out the dismissal.\n.The PIT-CNT emphasises that Uruguayan legislation still includes provisions which allow free dismissal of workers without giving reasons, on the sole condition that the statutory compensation is paid; the system of small fines imposed by the Ministry of Labour or the Labour Inspectorate (Decree No.  of  February ) in the event of acts of anti-union discrimination is absolutely inadequate, given the reality of the Uruguayan trade union movement. In this particular case, the National Labour Directorate was manifestly ineffective, with the result that the conflict was aggravated; the mediating officials refrained from acting and left it to the parties to settle the dispute.\n.Lastly, the PIT-CNT alleges that in the second half of , the ""Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay"", which employs about  workers, introduced changes in its machinery. According to the trade union, this new machinery involved technological changes, which meant that the collective agreement in force since  and registered with the Ministry of Labour and which had been concluded between the parties and governed this important subject, should have been applied. The trade union organisation demanded that the Ministry ensure compliance with this agreement. Industrial action was also taken, consisting, inter alia, in the exercise of the right to strike with partial and total stoppages in the enterprise. At a time when both parties were willing to negotiate, the trade union decided to cease one of the stoppages, and the enterprise took this opportunity of accusing Messrs. Carlos Chemino (treasurer of the Workers\' Union of Cristaleras del Uruguay) and Anbal Lpez (shop steward) of flagrant misconduct, and dismissed them in September  in violation of Convention No. . The dismissal of these leaders was clearly motivated by anti-union aims, on the pretext of misconduct which had not']"

Moreover, with respect to the  election of the executive committee which was later recognised by the authorities, the Committee had implicitly considered that acts of interference contrary to the principles of Convention No.  had been committed (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ).\n.With respect to the  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government from which it concludes that a number of the teachers mentioned by the complainant organisation were teaching in State schools, and that the rest had given up teaching to take up other non-teaching jobs or activities of a political nature, or for legally sanctionable reasons not connected with the above-mentioned strike were not employed in the service. The Committee observes that the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH which was not recognised by the authorities told the mission that the problem of the dismissed teachers had not been resolved: one of the persons interviewed by the mission (Mr. Marcelino Borjas) said that he was still dismissed and that others were teaching in private schools.\n.Since the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook, during the mission, to send the ILO a precise account of the position of the persons dismissed, the Committee adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of this information.\n.Regarding the arrest of Mr. Ambrosio Sabio (ex-President of COLPROSUMAH), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the proceedings that began in  against Mr. Sabio for the offences of forging private documents, usurpation of functions and persistent embezzlement of COLPROSUMAH, are at the indictment stage. The Committee also notes that according to the Government Mr. Sabio was arrested on  December  and provisionally released on  January , certain proceedings having been declared invalid and there being insufficient grounds for the issue of a warrant of arrest.\n.The Committee also notes the statement made by Mr. Sabio to the mission, particularly the fact that the accusation against him dates from  and that already then the First Criminal Court found no grounds for his arrest. He was arrested some days after the regular congress of COLPROSUMAH which had been convened by the unrecognised board on  December . Since  four judges have been dealing with the matter without issuing a warrant of arrest for lack of grounds. Inexplicably, in the course of a very short substitution in December , the warrant was issued by a judge, who, in total disregard for legality, certified that in November  the officially recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH had been properly elected.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee, noting that Mr. Sabio was released  days after his arrest since there were no grounds for his imprisonment, concludes that the measures taken to deprive Mr. Sabio of his freedom were of an anti-union nature. The Committee deplores Mr. Sabio's imprisonment and at the same time draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or their activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .\n.The Committee had requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out concerning the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (see th Report, Case No. , para. ) and Mr. Gustavo Morales (see st Report, Case No. , para. ).\n.The Committee notes that, as mentioned in the mission report, the investigations are continuing, but that as yet the whereabouts of the leaders are still not known. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the length of time that has elapsed since the disappearance of these leaders, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the investigations being carried out to discover their whereabouts.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  January  in Honduras. The Committee notes with interest that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.b) With respect to the murder of a leader of ANACH, the murder of four leaders of SITRACOAGS and the attempted murder of three leaders of that organisation, the Committee observes that trials are under way and that two of the alleged perpetrators have been identified although they are fugitives from justice. The Committee expresses the hope that the trials under way will be concluded as soon as possible and that they will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.c) As regards  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government but adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of information on the present position of the dismissed teachers which, during the direct contacts mission, the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook to send.d) Concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders who have now been released (Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero and Mr. Ambrosio Sabio), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .e) The Committee expresses its concern at the long period that has elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leaders Messrs. Roldando Vindel and Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the investigations under way to ascertain their whereabouts.\n.The complaint of the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession was presented in a communication dated  March . At its meeting in February  the Committee, having noted that despite several requests the Government had still not sent the information and observations requested from it appealed to it to supply its observations as a matter of urgency. The Committee also drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the rule of procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, the Committee could submit a report on the substance of the matter even if the Government's observations had not been received by its next session (th Report of the Committee, para. ). Since then the Government has still not furnished information or observations on the matter.\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.) .\n.The complaint of violation of freedom of association is lodged against the Government of Honduras by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) on behalf of its affiliate, the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). According to the WCOTP, the Government has interfered with the right of organisations to draw up their rules and to elect their representatives by adopting legislative measures, and with the right of the most representative organisation to elect its representatives to advisory bodies by withdrawing this right of representation from genuine representatives of the teaching personnel of Honduras and giving it to a dissident group set up with the support of the Government and of the police and military.\n.The WCOTP explains that on  September  the Government adopted Legislative Decree No. - to promulgate an Act respecting the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH) , repealing the previous Act of  December  on the matter. The new Act was published in the Official Gazette on  October . It was prepared without the participation of this trade union organisation and, in drafting it, Parliament established new standards for the election of the executive committee of the organisation stipulating that trade union leaders may not be re-elected until two two-year periods had elapsed (sections  and  of the Act). According to the WCOTP, this text was adopted with a view to prejudicing the trade union executive of the COLPROSUMAH and in order to favour a group of teachers who have taken over the organisation with the support of the Government.\n.The WCOTP states that the adoption of this legislation and the change of trade union representatives on the various advisory bodies must be seen against the background of the events"", "" July , presented further allegations (Case No. ). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated  May  and in letters dated  and  August .\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of  July  provides a list of  trade unionists and  professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.\n.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.\n.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the  agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,\n.In its letters of  May , the Government indicates that of the  agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL,  had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in , and were set free by the courts in April and May  because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.\n.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.\n.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.\n.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.\n.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.\n.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.\n.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.\n.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on  of the  persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of  agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released  of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report."", "" July , presented further allegations (Case No. ). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated  May  and in letters dated  and  August .\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of  July  provides a list of  trade unionists and  professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.\n.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.\n.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the  agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,\n.In its letters of  May , the Government indicates that of the  agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL,  had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in , and were set free by the courts in April and May  because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.\n.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.\n.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.\n.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.\n.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.\n.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.\n.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial.

These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .\n.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.\n.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.\n.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.\n.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations.

It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers\' and workers\' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers\' and workers\' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.\n.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers\' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers\' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners\' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners\' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June  session,', '.The Committee has already examined allegations relating to the years immediately following the change of regime on  August  (closing down of the COB, the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers and the FSTMB; takeover of the National Urban Schoolteachers\' Federation; arrest and banishment of trade unionists). It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry.

The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.\n.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .\n.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).\n.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government\'s position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.\n.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government\'s statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions\' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.\n.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals', '.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos.  (communications dated  and  May and  and  October ),  (communication dated  April ),  (communications dated  and  September ), and  (communication dated  June ). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .\n.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).\n.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .\n.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).\n.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE).

The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.\n.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .\n.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).\n.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government\'s position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.\n.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government\'s statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions\' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.\n.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals', '.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos.  (communications dated  and  May and  and  October ),  (communication dated  April ),  (communications dated  and  September ), and  (communication dated  June ). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .\n.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).\n.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .\n.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).\n.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them.

It was not members of the Ministry of the Interior, but neighbours from the district, who participated in this demonstration. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August .\n.As regards Lazaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lazaro Corp Yeras left the country in September , when he went to live in the United States.\n.The Government points out that the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers\' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question.\n.The Government states that there are  national sectorial trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around  per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers\' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, when in fact their activities have nothing to do with trade union matters, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.\n.In the light of all these matters, the Government requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to conclude that this case should be definitively closed.\n.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba and refers to different acts committed against trade unionists or officials of independent trade union organizations: injuries, detentions, serious threats, acts of intimidation and harassment, refusals to grant permission to leave Cuba to attend trade union meetings and the refusal to grant legal personality to the CTDC and an anti-union dismissal.\n.The Committee notes the statements by the Government and in particular, that  per cent of workers in the country are members of  national sectorial trade unions, whose representatives are appointed and elected by the workers themselves, and that through their different bodies, trade union organizations participate systematically in the decision-making process. Moreover, the Committee observes that the Government states as regards the allegations contained in the first communication from the complainant organization that the persons to whom it refers do not have the status of trade unionists, do not represent any workers\' collective and do not have any employment relationship with any enterprise or any occupational activity in the country, and that their activities are not related to trade union matters - their objective is allegedly to obtain personal benefit - and that the events in question are not of a trade union nature.\n.In accordance with its usual practice, the Committee will carry out an examination of the different allegations on the basis of specific observations made by the Government; however, it would like to emphasize that in the light of all the information at its disposal it must determine whether or not there have been infringements of freedom of association, with account being taken of the provisions of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Cuba. The Committee must therefore take into account the fact that there exists only one officially recognized central trade union organization mentioned in the legislation and that on previous occasions, complaints have been made concerning the refusal to grant official recognition to trade union organizations outside the existing officially recognized trade union structure. In the same way, in its last report (), the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations requested the Government ""to guarantee in law and in practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom"" (see Report III (Part A), ILC, nd Session, , p. ).\n.As regards the alleged refusal to grant permission to leave Cuba (November  and June ) to Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, a trade unionist of the Union of Workers of Cuba, thus preventing him from attending meetings organized by the ICFTU, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Gutierrez was on bail at the time, pending judicial proceedings against him in the criminal courts, so that he could not complete his plans for travelling to a foreign country, and that he subsequently left the country on the dates mentioned by the ICFTU. In this respect, observing that the Government has not indicated the specific allegations made against Mr. Gutierrez in the criminal proceedings and bearing in mind that the Government has not denied the statement by the complainant organization that this person was imprisoned for trying to obtain official recognition of the Union of Workers of Cuba, the Committee concludes that the authorities refused Mr. Gutierrez permission to leave the country to attend ICFTU meetings because of proceedings related to the carrying out of legitimate trade union activities. The Committee therefore deplores that Mr. Gutierrez was not permitted to attend two meetings organized by the ICFTU and requests the Government in future to guarantee respect of the principle whereby ""since participation by unionists in international trade union meetings is a fundamental trade union right, governments should abstain from any measure ... that would prevent representatives of workers\' organizations from exercising their mandate in full freedom and independence"". (See th Report, Case No.  (Zambia), para. ; rd Report, Case No.  (Lesotho), para. .)\n.As regards the alleged serious injuries caused by three men (concerning whom the complainant organization states that it has reason to believe had links with the Cuban security forces) against the persons of Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Workers of Cuba, and his younger son in August , the Committee notes that the Government states that it is totally false that Mr. Lazaro Corp was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior, that he made no complaint and that he left the country in September . The Committee wishes to emphasize that the complainant organization did not say that the injuries to Mr. Corp and his young son were caused by ""members of the Ministry of the Interior"", but by persons who had links ""with the Cuban security forces""; moreover, the complainant organization pointed out that this was the fifth act of aggression against Mr. Corp in less than three months. In this respect, the Committee believes that the terms in which the Government\'s reply is worded do not exclude the possibility that Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son were assaulted and injured because of the trade union status or activities of the former. The Committee therefore requests the Government in future to ensure that no trade union official or trade unionist should be assaulted because of his or her trade union status or activities, and of course neither should his or her family members. The Committee requests the Government to set up a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries inflicted on the trade union official Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son despite the fact that they no longer live in Cuba, and to keep it informed in this respect.\n.Furthermore, the Committee notes the allegations concerning Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers: threats to make her disappear or to imprison her made by a commander in May  when she was summoned to appear at the Department of State Security; body search and stripping; placing in an intimidation cell; new threats of attack and beating by ""mobs"" and ""neighbours""; a demonstration by the ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the home of Edith Lupe, where dissidents Juan Jos Lpez and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also present; and participation by officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba in the demonstration.\n.In this respect the Committee notes that the Government states: () that the name of the person in question was not Edith Lupe but Enid Amelia Luque; () that she was summoned by the national police and given a warning because of her provocative activities which were contrary to public order, in accordance with the legislation; ()', 'offensive interrogation;- according to the complainant organization\'s sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n.In its reply, the Government cited the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n.Referring to various allegations, the Government made the following observations:- the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On  May, she was summoned to the th station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in the Capri district, and was given a warning for having carried provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August ;- as regards Lzaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lzaro Corp Yeras left the country in September , when he went to live in the United States;- the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers\' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question;- there are  national sectoral trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around  per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers\' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.\n.The Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):- the Committee requests the Government to open a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries allegedly inflicted on the trade union official Lzaro Corp and his younger son, and to keep it informed in this respect;- as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of and threats and other acts of harassment against Enid Amelia Luque, Organization Secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba, the Committee requests the Government to provide the more detailed information to which reference is made in the conclusions, so that it can examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts (in this respect, in its conclusions, the Committee had pointed out that the Government had not explained the substance of the ""acts of provocation against public order"" by Enid Amelia Luque and ""four delinquents"", and which resulted in a ""warning"" being delivered in the offices of the national police, or of the ""demonstration"" against her conduct by neighbours from the district, or the content of the ""warning"" by the national police (see th Report, para. ));- finally, noting that the Government had not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organization in its communication of  July , the Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on:- - the refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC);- - the arrest and harassment of and threats against several officials of the CTDC;- - the expulsion from his work centre of a trade unionist of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization after he had called for better working conditions.\n.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras and his son were not attacked by ""persons linked with the Cuban security forces"", as stated by the complainant organization without providing any proof. No formal complaint to this effect has been lodged with any police unit. It was also ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras is not a trade union official, nor does he represent any workers\' collective or have an employment relationship with any workplace. This person left the country in September .\n.As regards the allegations concerning Ms. Enid Amelia Luque, the Government states that in addition to the information given in its previous reply of  July , which it confirms, according to the inquiries made, Ms. Enid Amelia Luque caused a public scandal and disorder near her place of residence, making offensive statements to which the neighbours reacted by expressing rejection of her conduct. There were no acts of violence, only a public scandal, disrupting neighbourly relations. The Government adds that the warning in question was issued in accordance with procedural law, at a meeting with police instructors at which the person is informed of the offence and warned not to repeat it. It is not true that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque was placed in a cell or subjected to a body search. She spent a short period of time in the police office, only in order to comply with the established procedures. Ms. Enid Amelia Luque is not a trade unionist, nor is she a union official, nor does she represent any workers\' collective. She does not have an employment relationship with any workplace. She left the country in August .\n.As regards the allegations presented by the ICFTU in its communication of  July , the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that there is no trade union called the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba in any enterprise or labour body in the entire country. The persons referred to in the ICFTU\'s letter dated  July , Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln, Jess Crdenas Lpez and Ren Jos Montero Garay, are not trade union officials, nor have they been subjected to threats and harassment. These persons have been neither nominated nor elected in any workplace in the country as representatives of any workers\' collective. Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln left the country in March .\n.As regards the alleged expulsion of a trade unionist who, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, was a member of a Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that this person was transferred from his post as a disciplinary administrative measure on three occasions for unjustified absence from work and for being disrespectful to his superiors and fellow workers. These measures were imposed in accordance with the labour legislation in force, and the worker submitted to them without availing himself of the remedies laid down in the legislation. On  October , he requested leave from his workplace in order to evade another labour sanction for the same reasons. Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos has never been nominated or elected by the workers of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill as a union official. Eduardo Lamas Campos has a criminal record.', 'whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (Article  of the Convention)"".\n.The complaint is contained in a communication of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  October . This organization sent additional information in a communication dated  July .\n.At its meeting of June , noting that it had not received any reply to the allegations from the Government, the Committee made an urgent appeal and indicated that in accordance with procedure it would examine the case at its next meeting even if the Government\'s reply had not been received (see th Report of the Committee, para. ).\n.The Government replied to the allegations contained in the first communication from the ICFTU in a communication dated  July .\n.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, one of the leaders of the Union of Workers of Cuba (USTC), was twice refused permission to leave Cuba to attend meetings of the ICFTU Committee on Human and Trade Union Rights, held in November  and June . The Government alleged that Mr. Gutierrez was still subject to a sentence resulting from his opposition to the Government; the real reason for the refusal was that for the last two years he had been trying to secure official recognition of the USTC, and had been imprisoned for that reason, but released following pressure brought to bear by the international trade union movement. The non-recognition of the USTC was examined by the Committee in its th Report (Case No. ), paras. -). In protest against the Government\'s refusal to let him leave Cuba, Mr. Gutierrez went on a hunger strike on  June, which he ended on  July, due to the solidarity expressed by the international trade union movement.\n.The ICFTU adds that according to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC, was summoned to appear on  May  at the Department of State Security, located in Reparto Capri, in the Havana municipality of Arroyo Naranjo, by the commander of this body. Inside the aforementioned premises, the official threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Mrs. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"".\n.The ICFTU also alleges during the week of - July  that CTDC officials were the victims of a violent demonstration by the so-called ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the residence of Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC. The dissidents Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also at her residence at the time. Officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba participated in this demonstration.\n.Furthermore, on  August , in the Avenida  del Rpto. Siboney, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault, the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lazaro Corp, once again shows the flagrant violation by the Government of Cuba of internationally recognized trade union rights and principles.\n.After condemning the terrible harassment to which independent trade unionists in Cuba are subject, and which has often been denounced by the ICFTU, this organization emphasizes the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba.\n.In its communication of  July , the ICFTU alleges that the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is especially the case of Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen (president), Jesus Crdenas Lpez (vice-president) and Rene Jos Montero Garay (secretary responsible for international relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain its legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration.\n.The ICFTU states that on  September , at  p.m., Mr. Rene Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones esquine Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that both he himself and Martinez Guillen and Jesus Crdenas would be sentenced to - years\' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued their defence of the Cuban working class. Moreover, on  November , at . p.m., Messrs. Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen, President of the CTDC, and Jesus Crdenas Lpez, vice-president of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation.\n.The ICFTU also states that, according to its sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization, in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was both small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n.In its communication of  July , the Government explains that the delay in sending its reply was due mainly to the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the communication from the ICFTU, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n.That being said, the Government adds that the inquiries carried out on the basis of the scant information contained in the complaint have shown that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez could not complete his plans to travel to a foreign country since at that time he was on bail pending legal proceedings against him in the criminal courts. Mr. Rafael Gutierrez subsequently left the country on the dates given by the ICFTU in its communication.\n.The Government adds that the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On  May, she was summoned to the ninth station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in Reparto Capri, and was given a warning for having carried out provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. The Government states that it is incorrect that Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Wilmer Lazaro Mora Beltran were the victims of a violent demonstration or that they were at the residence of the said Enid Amelia Luque when a group of neighbours']"

The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.\n.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). Cases Nos.  and  were last examined at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )). Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).\n.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  December  and  August .\n.The Government sent partial information in communications dated  and  May .\n.In addition, the Committee requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ).\n.Owing to the lack of detailed information from the Government concerning the allegations, the Committee has had to adjourn these four cases on several occasions, finally making an urgent appeal to the Government at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ). In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.\n.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).\n.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) commission ad hoc failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.\n.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.\n.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the corresponding court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police after they were caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the corresponding magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).\n.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has refrained from replying to the remaining outstanding allegations as well as to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .\n.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.\n.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to furnish it with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained,"", ""attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee.

Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). Cases Nos.  and  were last examined at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )). Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).\n.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  December  and  August .\n.The Government sent partial information in communications dated  and  May .\n.In addition, the Committee requested the Government, in February, May and November  and in February and May , to accept a direct contacts mission (see th Report, para. , th Report, para. , th Report, para. , st Report, paras.  and , and rd Report, para. ).\n.Owing to the lack of detailed information from the Government concerning the allegations, the Committee has had to adjourn these four cases on several occasions, finally making an urgent appeal to the Government at its November  meeting (see th Report, para. ). In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.\n.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).\n.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) commission ad hoc failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.\n.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.\n.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the corresponding court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police after they were caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the corresponding magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).\n.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has refrained from replying to the remaining outstanding allegations as well as to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .\n.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.\n.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to furnish it with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained,"", ""attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee.

Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.\n.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.\n.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.\n.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.\n.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.\n.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.\n.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.\n.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.\n.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .\n.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.\n.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.\n.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.\n.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.\n.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated."", ""their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs.

The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.\n.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .\n.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.\n.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.\n.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.\n.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.\n.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.""]"
