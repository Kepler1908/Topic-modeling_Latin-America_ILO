The list of 116聽workers was drawn up by ASIC and its officials, including the provincial secretary of Holgu铆n, Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez, who had received threats for publishing it. The complainant indicates in this regard that many international bodies have spoken out against the violations committed by the State on those days, including the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs. The complainant alleges, in addition, that two ASIC members, Mr Yunier Herrera Rodr铆guez and Mr Humberto Bello Laffita, were arrested [in April 2022] after taking part in the 2021 peaceful demonstrations. It alleges in this respect that: (i)聽Mr聽Yunier Herrera Rodr铆guez was violently arrested on 12 July 2021, after peacefully demonstrating to reclaim the trade union rights constantly being violated by the regime. During the arrest, he was violently beaten, during which he lost a number of teeth. In prison, he is being bullied by prison guards who are trying to subjugate him; (ii) Mr Humberto Bello Laffita was arrested after responding to the peaceful call to demonstrate on 15 November 2021. He was sentenced to a one-year prison term for the alleged offence of 鈥渟preading an epidemic鈥? He is being held in prison 鈥?580鈥?in the San Miguel del Padr贸n district in Havana, kept in isolation in a punishment cell without electricity or drinking water (communication dated 11 April 2022).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364382, response status: 200"

It alleges specifically that:On 19 February 2022, the trade union activist, Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ram铆rez, and brother of the independent ASIC member Mr B谩rbaro de la Nuez Ram铆rez, was arrested in Cienfuegos province while returning from a visit to the city of Col贸n in Matanzas province. Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ram铆rez was taken in a police car to the provincial unit鈥檚 technical investigations department of the Departamento de Seguridad del Estado (DSE) (Department of State Security) in the city of Cienfuegos, where he was interrogated for four hours by an official of the secret political police about his visit to Matanzas province and his meeting with the ASIC general secretary. During the interrogation, the official accused him of 鈥渕ercenary activity鈥? allegedly for receiving funds from a foreign power for the purpose of 鈥渟ubverting internal order鈥? He warned him that, in addition to the fact that no trade unionist will be allowed to travel from one province to another for work meetings and that, with the new Criminal Code, any persons who accept financial assistance from abroad, including mobile phone top-ups, will be imprisoned (communication dated 23 February 2022).Mr Leonardo Hern谩ndez Camejo, an activist affiliated to ASIC鈥檚 Havana provincial secretariat, was stopped in the early hours of 16 March 2022 by a police car as he was leaving his home in the capital鈥檚 Centro Habana municipality and arbitrarily arrested. He was taken to the Zanja police unit in the same municipality, where he was placed in a cell and interrogated by a DSE agent about his trade union activities. He was released the same day after 7 p.m. and issued serious threats and warnings (communication dated 22聽March 2022). He was also threatened by the police during a subsequent interrogation in August 2023 (communication dated 6 September 2023).On 22 February 2022, three state security agents arrested ASIC鈥檚 general secretary in Holgu铆n province, Mr Ram贸n Zamora Ricardo Rodr铆guez, at his home and took him to the criminal prosecution unit in Pedernales, where they issued him with a warning for his posts on social media networks, warning him that if he continued, he would be prosecuted for the offences of 鈥渆nemy propaganda鈥?and 鈥渄issemination of fake news鈥? Mr Ram贸n Zamora Ricardo Rodr铆guez, his two sons Yisan Zamora Ricardo (ASIC youth secretary) and Lisan Zamora Ricardo, and his wife, Ms Mail铆n Ricardo, were victims of fresh attacks on 5聽October 2022. They were arrested after demonstrating peacefully the previous day in front of their home, banging pots and pans to protest against the continuous and prolonged power cuts, in a simultaneous demonstration with neighbours in the area. Department of State Security agents raided the home of Mr Ram贸n Zamora Ricardo Rodr铆guez, seizing all telephones, computer equipment and printed trade union training material, as well as documents relating to his responsibilities as ASIC鈥檚 national trade union leader. The family was subsequently transferred to the centre for criminal and police investigations in Holgu铆n province for public order offences. The wife was released the same night, and the other family members four days later, without any explanation and with total disregard for their human and procedural rights (communications dated 10 and 14 October 2022).On Sunday 16 October 2022, ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Ib谩n Guerra Hern谩ndez, and his wife, Ms Kety Mart铆nez, were summoned to the police unit in the municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, Mayabeque province. During the interrogation by a DSE agent, the latter threatened the trade unionist with imprisonment and gave him a warning. In the case of his wife, who is not an ASIC member, the police officer interrogated her separately and warned her that her husband would go to prison for his activism and especially for his comments on social media (communication dated 24 October 2022).Also subjected to threats from DSE agents, in the province of Cienfuegos in November 2022, were ASIC national executive member, Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes (a victim of similar threats on other occasions), and ASIC representative in the aforementioned province, Ms聽Consuelo Rodr铆guez Hern谩ndez, and her husband Mr L谩zaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza (who were subjected to harassment in the street and threats at work). A DSE agent took the opportunity to send an intimidating message through Mr L谩zaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza to Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras, ASIC executive member, to stop him from continuing to register complaints and send them to ASIC鈥檚 general secretary, Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo (communication dated 5 December 2022).On 9 December 2022, trade unionists Mr L谩zaro Roberto Aguiar Mendoza and Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras were arrested in the municipality of Cruces. After agents of the National Revolutionary Police and an unidentified DSE agent searched their belongings, they were warned that they could not leave the municipality of Cruces until after 10 December. On that date, ASIC provincial secretary, Ms Yorsi Kelin S谩nchez Perdig贸n, was arrested at her home in Sancti Sp铆ritus and taken to the police unit in the city, where she was detained for three days. According to relatives, the arrest followed a call for a national strike. On the same day, several trade unionists were kept under house arrest and not allowed to leave: in the municipality of Caibari茅n, Mr Ismael Castro Valent铆n and Ms Dania Marit茅 Noriega Castriz; in Havana, trade union journalist Ms Yunia Figueredo Cruz; in the municipality of Cruces, Mr Carlos Reyes Consuegras; and in Col贸n, Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, ASIC general secretary, was kept under close guard in and around his home. On 8 December 2022, another ASIC member, Mr Yolsdan Armenteros V谩zquez, was summoned to the 3rd police unit in Santa Clara, where he was threatened with conviction under the new Criminal Code 鈥?which increases the number of crimes that carry life imprisonment and the death penalty 鈥?if he continued to post news on social media (communication dated 13 December 2022).Seven ASIC activists and officials were arrested in early February 2023: activists Mr Luis Orlando Le贸n Randich, Mr Ulises Gonz谩lez, Mr Leonardo Hern谩ndez Camejo, Ms Yaquelin Dalis Caballero, Mr Felipe Carrera Hern谩ndez, as well as provincial secretaries Mr Reinaldo Cosano Al茅n and Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, who had previously been briefly arrested on 24 February 2022 by a police unit while on his way to the home of an opposition activist in the Santo Su谩rez neighbourhood (communication dated 1 March 2022). During the arrests, in addition to the persistent threats of judicial sanctions and the attempt to implicate general secretary Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo in an offence, an accusation of a heinous crime was recorded for the first time: DSE agents told the detainees that there was a 鈥渟uspicion鈥?that ASIC members might be involved in the 鈥減oisoning of the water in los c铆rculos infantiles [children鈥檚 day-care centres]鈥? which, according to the agents, was under investigation (communication dated 9 February 2023). Furthermore, during interrogations on 7 February, the DSE agents added the serious accusation that they considered ASIC to be 鈥渁 terrorist organization鈥?(communication dated 23 February 2023).ASIC general secretary, Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, is particularly targeted by threats. The complainant recalls that he was one of the 75 prisoners of the 鈥淏lack Spring鈥?of March聽2003, sentenced to an arbitrary and excessive 25-year prison term, of which he served eight years and six months. In 2011 he was granted a licencia extrapenal [parole], meaning that the sentence still hangs over him and he could be sent to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence without any judicial proceedings (communications dated 4聽September 2022 and 9 February 2023). On Tuesday, 21 February 2023, he was arrested as he left the El Focsa building in Havana, together with another independent trade unionist, Ms Maybell Padilla P茅rez, and was taken away in a police car. Around 20 officers from the political and national police took part in the operation led by two DSE agents. The reason for his arrest centred on the ban on visiting Havana. Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo was kept locked in a patrol car for four hours, with the outside temperature at 32聽degrees Celsius, before being taken to an interrogation office, where he was stripped completely naked in order to humiliate him. During the interrogation, in addition to the persistent threats of judicial sanctions and that his parole would be revoked, he was also banned from visiting the capital so as to prevent him from carrying out his trade union work (communication dated 23 February 2023). The political police officers who interrogated him behaved aggressively and violently throughout. The other trade unionist also suffered the same consequences.On 14 April 2023, the independent trade unionists Mr Leonardo Hern谩ndez Camejo and Mr Luis Orlando Le贸n Randich were interrogated by DSE agents about their work, as well as, in the same police station in Centro Habana, ASIC provincial secretary Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi. On the same day, in a police unit in the municipality of Habana Vieja, independent trade unionist Ms Yaquelin S谩nchez Batista was also interrogated about her trade union work. The aforementioned events are yet another example of the continued repressive actions of Ministry of the Interior institutions to prevent the normal development of the organization鈥檚 trade union activities, and show that the aim of the escalation of repression is, as the officials of this institution have stated, 鈥渢o dismantle ASIC and make it disappear鈥?(communication dated 21 April 2023).Independent trade unionists Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi and Mr Charles Rodr铆guez were subjected to unlawful and arbitrary treatment by the political police on their return to the island after attending international events on defending human and labour rights in Panama City in the space of a week. On 20 May 2023, at around 10.15聽p.m., on arrival in Havana, from the flight from Panama City, the trade unionists were subjected to an arbitrary search of their luggage and to a 鈥渃onversation鈥?with the political police 鈥?in reality an interrogation 鈥?about their trade union activities, the names of the leaders with whom they had met and the main issues they had discussed. This unlawful procedure lasted around three hours between the search and the detention, so that they remained at the airport until 1.30 a.m., being the last passengers to leave the airport (communication dated 28 May 2023).On the occasion of the commemoration of the second anniversary of the mass protests that shook the country on 11 July 2021, in order to pre-empt potential peaceful protests, in the days leading up to the date the regime arrested, threatened and interrogated a dozen independent trade unionists, Mr Alexis G贸mez Rodr铆guez, Mr Carlos Javier G贸mez Guevara, Mr Rodolfo Aparicio Alem谩n, ASIC provincial secretary Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, and general secretary Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo. Similarly, the homes of several ASIC activists were kept under surveillance by DSE agents: the homes of provincial secretary Mr Liv谩n Monteagudo Rivero, independent trade unionists Ms Yunia Figueredo Cruz, Ms Yaquelin Daly Caballero, Mr Ulises Gonz谩lez Moreno and Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi remained under siege throughout the day by police or DSE agents in civilian clothes (communication dated 20 July 2023).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364382, response status: 200"

Thus, on 18 March 2022, ASIC鈥檚 deputy general secretary, Mr Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var, was refused a passport and notified of a ban on travel outside the country. This action is due to the fact that Alejandro visited the ILO headquarters for the 107th Session of the International Labour Conference, where he denounced the anti-union practices of the Cuban regime. Since then, he has been banned from leaving the national territory, making it impossible for him to attend international events, including seminars, trade union congresses and events held in support of Cuban workers (communication dated 18 March 2022).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364382, response status: 200"

Thus, on 22 September 2022, trade union and civil society organizations from several countries in the Americas met in the city of San Jos茅, Costa Rica, for the regional forum on solidarity with Cuban workers. The virtual participation of ASIC leaders was planned.

The complainants operate under the agendas of the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy to engage in internal subversion that constitutes an affront to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, particularly the principles of sovereignty, self-determination and non-interference in internal affairs.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364382, response status: 200"

One of their main objectives in engaging in activities against the Cuban constitutional order has been precisely to obtain the corresponding 鈥渆ndorsement鈥?in order to be able to emigrate and more easily obtain immigration status to reside in the United States of America in particular; and (ii) investigations have shown on several occasions that some of these persons have never been subjected to police or any other type of action. They simply fabricate unsubstantiated allegations that the Government is then required to respond to and prove to be false, when they did not even occur. In its communication dated 24 October 2022, the Government reports on each of the individuals mentioned in recommendation (b):(1) Mr lv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo: The Committee has been informed on several occasions that this person has no employment relationship and that he has engaged in making false accusations to the ILO supervisory bodies in order to denigrate the country鈥檚 record on labour and trade union rights. It has been reported on numerous occasions that this citizen has been granted parole and is currently serving the remainder of his sentence in freedom, which ends in the first half of 2028. This means that, under existing criminal legislation in the country, he must comply with certain obligations imposed by law.(2) Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hern谩ndez: The investigation reiterated that he had been declared 鈥渦nfit to work鈥?by the Expert Occupational Medical Examination Commission owing to his schizophrenia. His social and moral behaviour is despised by society and he lacks any support in his community.(3) Mr B谩rbaro Tejeda S谩nchez: He displays appalling social behaviour and has been prosecuted on 12 occasions for the offences of theft, leaving the national territory illegally, public disorder, making threats, speculation, hoarding and handling stolen goods. He left Cuba for Nicaragua in 2019 and has not returned.(4) Mr Pedro Scull: He has had no employment relationship and no links to ASIC since 2016. It has been reported that this person died in 2020.(5) Mr Felipe Carrera Hern谩ndez: His activities have been aimed at seeking financial gain, with no credibility in his area of operation. No police action has been taken against him. Since 2017, he has made five trips abroad, three to Panama and two to Colombia.(6) Ms Ariadna Mena: She has no relationship with ASIC, from which she was separated due to conflicts with Mr Iv谩n Hernandez Carrillo, who expelled her from the organization. Since 2015, she has made eight trips abroad, including three to Colombia, two to Panama, two to Peru and one to France. On 21 June 2022, she left the country for Guyana, to make the journey to settle permanently in the United States. No police action was ever taken against her.(7) Ms Hilda Ayl铆n L贸pez Salazar: She has been living abroad since 21 April 2017. Between 2015 and 2017 she made four trips abroad, three to Panama and one to the United States.(8) Mr Pavel Herrera Hern谩ndez: He has been living abroad since 18 June 2016 and was previously the subject of a criminal prosecution for the offence of theft.(9) Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi: Several allegations have been received by the Committee about this citizen, which have been answered after the corresponding investigations.(10) Mr Ra煤l Domingo Zerguera Borren: He has not been subjected to measures of any kind, nor has any regulation been imposed on his movements outside the territory. He has complete freedom of movement, precisely because he works as a taxi driver. He is not linked to ASIC at the moment, as he is focused on his arrangements for leaving the country, as he was accepted in the 鈥渧isa lottery鈥?of the United States embassy.(11) Mr Reinaldo Cosano Al茅n: He is unemployed due to his advanced age. No police action has been taken against him. From 2015 to date he has made three trips to Panama and two to Colombia.(12) Mr L谩zaro Ricardo P茅rez: Since 2015, he has made ten trips to Colombia and Mexico, three to Panama and five to the United States. Since 2019 he has lived in the United States with his family.(13) Mr Hiosvani Pupo: He currently resides outside Cuba. During his stay in the country, he worked as a bicycle taxi driver in the municipalities of Centro Habana and Habana Vieja, illegally and without applying for the required licence.(14) Mr Daniel Perea Garc铆a: On 5 August 2019 he was charged with the offence of receiving and selling electrical transformer oil. He currently has no links with ASIC. He has not been subjected to threats or harassment.(15) Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo: He was arrested on 25 July 2021, charged with the offence of public disorder for holding demonstrations obstructing the public highway. After 72聽hours, he was released, with no other charges against him.(16) Mr Willian Cruz Delgado: He has an extensive criminal record, which has been previously reported to the Committee. Between 2004 and 2018 he was sanctioned for the offences of assault, making threats, contempt of court and public disorder. On 24 August 2019, he was fined for contravening the provisions of Decree Law No. 141/88 and failing to carry with him his personal identification papers. Between 2015 and 2021, he was reported on four occasions for less serious injury, contempt and public disorder; he was also taken on nine occasions to a National Revolutionary Police station for engaging in the illicit sale of goods and foreign currency. It was ascertained that this person has never been prosecuted for exercising his labour or trade union rights.(17) Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel: He now resides permanently abroad. During his stay in the country he remained unemployed.(18) Ms Yadislandia Hurtado Bicet: She is not linked to any trade union association in Cuba, nor is she linked to ASIC. The link that has been established is related to the support she receives from Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, for personal interests that are unrelated to labour or trade union matters.(19) Mr Dannery G贸mez Galeto: He now resides permanently abroad. During his stay in the country he remained unemployed.(20) Mr Roque lv谩n Mart铆nez Beldarra铆n: This is a person with a long criminal record, which has already been reported to the Committee. He was dismissed from the Port of Cienfuegos due to repeated indiscipline associated with unjustified absences, lateness, mistreatment and disrespect towards co-workers and superiors, for which he was repeatedly summoned by members of his trade union branch and workplace management, who then terminated his contract in accordance with the established procedures.(21) Mr Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var: This person has no employment relationships. Investigations have shown that there is no record of any police action or complaint against him in 2021.(22) Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene: He has no links to ASIC. He and his mother, Ms聽Anairis Dania Mezerene, were arrested and taken to the national police unit in Holgu铆n at 5.30 p.m. on 11 July 2021 for a breach of public order during disturbances on that day. Polo Mezerene was held there for 72 hours and subsequently released with an administrative fine.(23) Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez and Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo: Information on these two citizens has been sent to the Committee in the past following relevant investigations.(24) Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo: No police action has been taken against him, let alone any kind of harassment.(25) Mr Ulises Rafael Hern谩ndez L贸pez: This is a person who displays anti-social behaviour, with three official warnings issued for such behaviour, for not looking after his children and for breach of public order.(26) Mr Humberto Jos茅 Bello Laffita: Detailed information on this person was sent to the Committee in response to two communications received during the period.(27) Ms Aim茅e de las Mercedes Cabrera 脕lvarez: No police action has been taken against this citizen. Between 2015 and 2019 it is recorded that she made four trips abroad, three of them to Panama and one to the United States. She has no employment relationship.(28) Ms Consuelo Rodr铆guez Hern谩ndez: No police action has been taken against this citizen.(29) Ms Ma铆l铆n Ricardo G贸ngora: No police action has been taken against this citizen either. As far as is known, she has no links with any trade union group or with ASIC.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364382, response status: 200"

Current migration legislation determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right of a person to leave the country and this is regulated clearly and precisely in article 25 of Decree Law No. 302 of 2012, amending Act No. 1312 of 1976, the 鈥淢igration Act鈥? This power is exercised in a non-arbitrary manner, in accordance with the law and respecting the guarantees provided. The Government reiterates that the restriction of access to virtual platforms is related to technical obsolescence resulting from the policy of sanctions imposed by the United States鈥?Government on Cuba (communication dated 2 March 2023). Attempting to use the argument of the impossibility of participating in a virtual forum through a platform prohibited in Cuba, holding the Cuban Government responsible and not the Government imposing such restrictions, demonstrates the complainants鈥?real objective.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364382, response status: 200"

The Committee also recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since this is the first step that workers鈥?or employers鈥?organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately; and a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, paras 449, 463 and 666]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers, and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee secondly recalls that that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, para. 330]. The Committee reiterates that in its initial examination of this case, it had noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its key objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members鈥?duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers鈥?claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC鈥檚 declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers鈥?organization. The Committee can only regret that there has been no progress since its last examination of this case and therefore once again refers to its previous conclusions and once more strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364382, response status: 200"

The Committee recalls in this regard that on numerous occasions where the complainants alleged that trade union officials or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments鈥?replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests had been made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the alleged arrests, particularly in connection with the judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof, and the outcome of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations.

The complainant organization specifically alleges:The anti-union dismissal of two members of ASIC (trade union activist, Mr Ismael Valent铆n Castro, and the head of Mujeres Trabajadoras (Women Workers) in the province of Villa Clara, Ms Dania Noriega), following inspections conducted at the end of March 2021 by officials from the Department of State Security (DSE) at their workplace, the Brisas del Mar hotel complex, in the municipality of Caibari茅n, in the Villa Clara province. The complainant organization reports that: (i) three officials dressed as civilians approached Mr Valent铆n Castro and told him that they knew who he was and advised him to leave and to stop working in order to avoid any further issues; (ii) Ms Noriega received an audit which resulted in a fine of 2,500 Cuban pesos (equivalent to a monthly minimum wage) 鈥?although they told her that they knew she was an opponent and that if she handed in her resignation, nothing would happen and that they would not apply the fine, which, in the end, was imposed and paid through the ASIC solidarity fund鈥? and (iii) subsequently, the DSE officials forced the administration to dismiss both trade unionists and to disguise the dismissals as the result of restructuring. The complainant organization notes that no explanation is provided as to the legal grounds on which the dismissal was based, other than a vague reference to legislation, applied by the employer in a discretionary manner. It also states that this is a common practice against ASIC activists and officials: when they are found to be participating in trade union activities, they are penalized or removed from their posts without justification (communication dated 7 April 2021).The increased harassment, surveillance and persecution of the ASIC general secretary, Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, by the police, to the point where he feared for his physical safety and life. The complainant organization reports that: (i) Mr Hern谩ndez鈥檚 home is strictly monitored and every time that he leaves, he is overtly followed (with close physical contact) by State security agents; (ii) the situation has worsened, with the receipt of anonymous messages on social media making death threats against him, which, ASIC states, come from police intelligence agencies for the purpose of harassment and intimidation; and (iii) as has now become customary, these measures were accompanied by threats to send him back to prison (the general secretary served eight and a half of the 25 years to which he was sentenced as part of the spring repression of 2003, and was granted parole (licencia extrapenal) (communication of 12 May 2021).The cyber lockout experienced by the ASIC general secretary on 29 June 2021 when attempting to access the webinar organized by the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba (GIRSCC) and the French Democratic Confederation of Labour, on the subject of bilateral relations between the European Union and Cuba, the current status of labour relations in Cuba and fundamental labour rights. The complainant organization alleges that: (i) the ASIC general secretary attempted on several occasions to connect to Zoom to attend the aforementioned event but was prevented from accessing it by an error message; (ii) in anticipation of this situation, he had made a pre-recording of his statement, which was transmitted to the meeting, although this did not allow for any interaction with the meeting; (iii) this was not a technical error, as other less exposed activists were able to connect to the event, and Mr Hern谩ndez was able to connect to a different event; and (iv) this appears to be a new method to limit the freedom of action of ASIC and its officials (the Government controls the activities in which the general secretary can participate and continues to prohibit him from leaving the country), and is additional evidence of cyber espionage carried out by the Cuban Government against ASIC activists (communication of 2聽July 2021).The direct intimidation and exposure to public scorn faced by ASIC deputy general secretary, Mr Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var, during a press conference broadcast by the national television network on 13 July 2021. During the press conference, the Chancellor presented a list of Twitter accounts, including the account of the deputy general secretary, and described them as instruments of the Government of the United States of America, used to destabilize the Cuban regime, an accusation which could result in serious charges against him, such as being in the service of a foreign power and treason, which carry heavy penalties including the death sentence. ASIC considers that, following the indiscriminate repression carried out by State security agencies, special forces and paramilitary gangs, during which they broke down doors and stormed houses, and beat, shot and arrested individuals involved in the protests, the accusations made by the Chancellor are clearly extremely dangerous for Mr S谩nchez and his family (communication of 15 July 2021).The violent repression against ASIC trade unionists in the context of the protests held on 11聽July 2021, as part of the widespread repression across the island, which was followed by persecution, harassment, illegal raids of homes and targeted arrests of the most prominent protesters and dissidents. The complainant organization specifically reports: (i) the brutal beatings by the police and paramilitary brigades, and, in some cases, arrests, of six ASIC members in the Holgu铆n province. The complainant organization refers to a detailed report on the assault of and injuries sustained by Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez (ASIC secretary in the Holgu铆n province) and Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo (secretary of the J贸venes Trabajadores (Young Workers) of ASIC in Holgu铆n), and by Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene S谩nchez, Mr聽Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Mail铆n Ricardo G贸ngora, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo and Mr Ulises Rafael Hern谩ndez L贸pez (ASIC members in Holgu铆n) (communication of 20聽July2021), and (ii) the temporary detention and intimidation of, and threats against the ASIC provincial delegate in Cruces, Ms Consuelo Rodr铆guez Hern谩ndez, and the summons of trade unionist, Ms Ketya Capote Gracias, to warn her that she was linked to a political prisoner on parole (communication of 26 July 2021).The arbitrary detention, beating, harassment of, and further threats against trade unionist, Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez and his son, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo. The complainant organization alleges that, on 25 July, Mr Zamora Ricardo was arrested and transferred to the DSE centre known as 鈥淧edernales鈥?(a centre denounced by opponents for the severe and brutal physical and psychological torture to which detainees are subjected). ASIC alleges that, at the DSE centre, Mr Zamora Ricardo was subjected to a variety of cruel, inhumane and degrading forms of treatment (he was punched, slapped, stripped naked and forced to squat, insulted and intimidated), and that, afterwards, both individuals were transferred to dark windowless cells, where there were known to be prisoners who had COVID 19, with the intention of them contracting the illness, which is what happened (communications of 30 September 2021).The sabotage of the participation of 19 ASIC trade unionists in an online training seminar hosted by the Colombian National Institute of Social Studies. It is alleged that the State entity providing the Internet service, which is controlled by the Ministry of Communications, cut off the communications and connections of all 19 registered trade unionists who were trying to participate from various locations on the island (communications of 30 September 2021).The repression of ASIC activists and officials the day before, during and after the demonstration organized by civil society groups on 15 November 2021. ASIC provides detailed allegations of: (i) visits by DSE officials to the homes of seven ASIC members to warn them not to leave their homes on 15 November, with threats to arrest and detain them; (ii) the summons of an ASIC activist to report to the police unit in Cruces, where she was interrogated and warned about the demonstration; (iii) the arrest of trade unionist, Mr Humberto Bello Lafita, on 13 November 2021, as he was leaving his home, and his transferral to the detention centre known as 鈥淓l Vivac鈥?in Havana, where he was given a one-year prison sentence following a rigged and unfair summary trial held in secret. He was then transferred to the Valle Grande prison in Havana; (iv) the arrest of ASIC provincial secretary in Santiago de Cuba, Mr Daniel Perera Garc铆a, who was taken to the DSE鈥檚 headquarters, Palma Soriano, in Santiago de Cuba, where he was beaten, insulted and offended. He was then handcuffed and transported to the municipal police station, where he was given a warning; (v) the detention, on 16 November 2021 in Holgu铆n, of ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez, together with his wife and son, who were arrested and taken by two DSE officers to the El Anillo police station, where he received warnings and was subjected to intimidation. On the afternoon of 14 November, and the morning of 15 November, DSE officers had gone to Mr Zamora鈥檚 home and told him that he and his son, in particular, could not leave their home or they would be confronted by rapid response groups. During these two days, members of the rapid response groups continued to besiege his home and family (these allegations are described in detail in the communication dated 20 December 2021); and (vi) the harassment and victimization of 20 other trade unionists at their homes, including the ASIC general secretary, on 14 and 15 November, by police officers and paramilitary mobs (communication of 24 November 2021); andFurther assault of the ASIC general secretary, Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, by DSE officials, and the receipt of serious threats following a police summons issued on 30 November 2021 with only three hours鈥?notice to comply. ASIC alleges that: (i) the authorities informed him that he had been summoned to discuss the offence of mercenarism, which he had allegedly committed by drafting a list of persons arrested on 11 July to be used to contact the families of those arrested; (ii) none of the activities covered by this offence correspond to the peaceful activities of trade union and civil activism carried out by the ASIC general secretary; in Cuba, where due process does not exist, mercenarism carries heavy penalties, including the death penalty, (Mr Hern谩ndez Carrillo was already convicted once in a summary trial in 2003); (iii) he was threatened that if he reoffended, his parole (licencia extrapenal) would be revoked, he would be imprisoned and an additional case would be opened against him for mercenarism; and (iv) he was ordered not to leave the municipality of Col贸n without prior authorization by State security (communication of 6 December 2021).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141424, response status: 200"

The Government considers that the Committee has not taken due consideration of the extensive information provided by the Cuban authorities.

Concerning the individual cases mentioned by the complainant organization, the Government repeats the same information previously provided, stating that:Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hern谩ndez was arrested, prosecuted and tried for acts that disturbed the peace of foreign nationals between 2015 and 2017 and was declared 鈥渦nfit for work鈥?by the Expert Occupational Medical Examination Commission owing to his schizophrenia.Mr Pavel Herrera Hern谩ndez was dismissed for a workplace disciplinary infraction and was the subject of criminal prosecution for the crime of theft. It is untrue that he was the subject of an anti-union dismissal.Mr Dannery G贸mez Galeto, Mr William Esm茅rido Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Iv谩n Mart铆nez Beldarrain, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel and Mr Yakdislania Hurtado Bicet were arrested and taken to the National Revolutionary Police station in the Col贸n municipality: (i) they were charged with subversive propaganda under current criminal legislation; (ii) the money confiscated was returned in full, and it is untrue that the individuals were threatened; (iii) Mr William Esm茅rido Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Iv谩n Mart铆nez Beldarrain and Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel received official warnings; (iv) Mr William Esm茅rido Cruz Delgado was fined for violating the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 141/88 and for failing to carry his personal identification, and (v) alleged trade unionists, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel and Mr Dannery G贸mez Galeto, currently live abroad, and were unemployed during their stay in Cuba.Mr Roque Iv谩n Mart铆nez Beldarrain has been prosecuted for the crimes of theft (2005), causing injury (2007, 2008 and 2009), speculation and hoarding (2013), making threats (2015) and handling stolen goods (2018).With regard to Mr William Esm茅rido Cruz Delgado: (i) between 2004 and 2018, he was convicted of the crimes of causing injury, making threats, contempt and public disorder; (ii) between 1998 and 2019, he received official warnings on six occasions for his continued antisocial behaviour; (iii) between 1990 and 2013, he received eight sanctions for various criminal acts that posed a low risk to society; between 2015 and 2018, he received two fines for violations of Legislative Decree No. 315 of 2013 on individual violations of the regulations governing self-employment; (iv) in October 2019, he was sentenced to one year鈥檚 imprisonment for two acts of contempt; and (v) between 2015 and 2021, he was reported on four occasions for less serious injury, contempt and public disorder, and was taken on nine occasions to the National Revolutionary Police station for engaging in the illicit sale of goods and currency.Mr Emilio Alberto Gottardi was not arrested, threatened or harassed; he was simply summoned to the Zanja police station in Havana with the aim of analysing the 鈥渇alse reports鈥?of alleged trade union violations that he had made during the ILO Centenary celebrations.It is untrue that Mr Daniel Perea Garc铆a was a victim of harassment, arbitrary arrest and threats: (i) in February 2019, he received an official warning regarding his duty to refrain from destabilizing, dissident and disconcerting activity; and (ii) in August 2019, he was charged with handling stolen goods (reports Nos 11329/19 and 11349/19).It is untrue that the freedom of movement around the country of Mr Emilio Alberto Gottardi, Mr Ra煤l Zerguera Borrell, Mr L谩zaro Ricardo P茅rez and Ms Aim茅e de las Mercedes Cabrera 脕lvarez has been restricted; Mr Ra煤l Zerguera Borrell works as a private carrier and makes unlimited journeys around the national territory.

Contrary to what is alleged, the Government states that the citizen adopted self-protective behaviour to avoid contagion. The Government highlights that this individual, who is pretending to be a trade unionist, has no employment relationship and has an extensive criminal record, and that he was convicted in 2003 for acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the State, following a fair trial, and was granted parole (licencia extrapenal) from March 2011 (thereby serving the remainder of his sentence in freedom, although, since then, he has been prosecuted on several occasions and the corresponding contraventions provided for in the Criminal Code have been applied). The Government states that the allegations concerning an apparent increase in continued serious violations by the police forces against alleged activists from the organization that calls itself ASIC, are also untrue, and that it is unfounded and absurd to accuse the Government of sending anonymous messages by text and on social media, in which Mr Hern谩ndez Carrillo was allegedly threatened.Concerning the allegations of violations of the public freedoms and trade union rights of Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez, the Government states that: (i) the allegation that he was kidnapped from his home on 1 July 2021 is false; (ii) there is no official record of any action having been taken by police authorities against this citizen on the above-mentioned date; (iii) it is also false that he was subjected to manipulation, death threats and psychological pressure for having exercised his freedom of expression on social media; (iv) Mr Zamora Rodr铆guez was arrested on 25 July for the offence of public disorder provided for by and punished under section 200 of the Criminal Code, and was then transferred to the police unit where he was detained for 72 hours; and (v) on 28 July, he received an official warning from the competent police authority and was later released.The Government states that it is also untrue that Ms Consuelo Rodr铆guez Hern谩ndez was a victim of harassment, intimidation, threats, persecution and repression by police authorities. Citizens Ms Consuelo Rodr铆guez and Ms Ketya Capote Gracias participated in meetings that violated the sanitary and epidemiological measures currently in force to address and control the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, they were summoned by the head of sector of the National Revolutionary Police and were given an official warning by the criminal investigator, with no other charges brought against them. During the proceedings, Ms Rodr铆guez Hern谩ndez refused to sign the record and Ms Capote Gracias recognized the measure applied and expressed regret. It is also false that these individuals were the subject of any police action. There is no indication in the files and records of our authorities that any such measures were applied to them.As regards the allegation that the authorities are blocking the access to virtual platforms of individuals who claim to be 鈥渢rade union leaders鈥?to prevent them from participating in international trade union training meetings and events, the Government states that: (i) this allegation is false and that making unfounded accusations against the Government of cyber espionage directed at alleged trade unionists is, to say the least, inconsistent and absurd; and (ii) restrictions on access to the Internet and information technology are due to the economic, trade and financial blockade imposed on the country, as a result of which a large number of free websites and services, including Zoom, are totally or partially blocked for Cuba, which makes it difficult for the country to participate in events online. It states that cyberspace is utilized to attempt to subvert the political system of the country, as has been recognized by Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council (the Government sends examples of technological services referred to above, which include Cuba on the list of restricted countries).Regarding the alleged harassment of Mr Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var, the Government states that: (i) it is untrue that he was the subject of intimidations during the press conference of 13 July 2021, in which the destabilization campaign waged against Cuba through the use of lies and data manipulation was denounced in front of the national and international press; (ii) the Twitter account of the citizen concerned (Mr Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var) is active and it is possible to see the degrading and hateful messages that he shares, and the fake news that he spreads, which demonstrates that there are no limitations of resources for the use of his account; and (iii) it rejects the accusations of repression in Cuba that allegedly create an insecure and dangerous situation for Mr S谩nchez Zald铆var and his relatives.The Government also rejects the allegations made by the complainants, in which they report acts of repression, persecution, harassment, victimization, illegal raids on homes, excessive use of force against protesters by police and military officers, and targeted arrests of the indicated persons for their participation in the unrest of July 2021. The Government reiterates that these individuals are not trade union leaders, do not have recognized employment relationships and display reprehensible social behaviour, and that some of these individuals have received criminal convictions for common offences. The Government indicates in particular that: (i) Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene S谩nchez and Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene were arrested and transferred to the Criminal Investigation Body in Holgu铆n on 11 July 2021 and received a charge of public disorder, on the grounds of which they were issued a fine of 3,000 Cuban pesos (approximately US$125); (ii) Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez was arrested and transferred to the Criminal Investigation Body in Holgu铆n on 25 July 2021 and was charged with the offence of public disorder; it is false that he was arrested and threatened by law enforcement officers; and there is no record that he was subject to any measures by police authorities; (iii) Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo is not connected to the work of ASIC; he was arrested and transferred to the Criminal Investigation Body in Holgu铆n on 25聽July, with a charge of public disorder; it is untrue that he was dismissed from his workplace for being associated with political motivations, and that he did not have access to recruitment forums due to the activities of security bodies; and (iv) all the allegations relating to the humiliating treatment of Ms Mail铆n Ricardo G贸ngora, Mr Lis谩n Zamora Ricardo and Mr Ulises Rafael Hern谩ndez L贸pez are false; they were not linked to ASIC, were not detained, and no measures were applied to them, despite their involvement in the events of 11 July.Regarding the allegations of repression of ASIC activists the day before, during and after the demonstration organized by civil society groups on 15 November 2021 (contained in the communication from ASIC on 24 November 2021), the Government: (i) states that these are crude fabrications that seek to discredit the actual situation in Cuba in terms of the promotion and protection of human rights, and to manipulate the ILO supervisory bodies for political purposes, and underscores that it is becoming increasingly difficult to reply to the Committee regarding events that have not even taken place, and states that the Committee should request the complainants to demonstrate the veracity of the information that they provide; (ii) reiterates that these individuals are not trade union leaders, do not have employment relationships and display reproachable social behaviour, and that some have received criminal convictions for committing common offences; (iii) indicates that, of the above-mentioned persons, police and court records show only that Mr Humberto Jos茅 Bello Lafita was arrested on 11 November 2021, with the charge of spreading an epidemic and failing to comply with penalties, and received a one-year prison sentence, which is to be served at the correctional facility No. 1580; and (iv) states that there is no evidence that the other individuals referred to above were the subject of any police action on the days prior to 15 November 2021, that it is untrue that police authorities visited the homes of the individuals on the indicated dates and that arbitrary detentions or arrests were carried out against these persons.Regarding the additional allegations of harassment to Mr Zamora, his home and family in November 2021 (contained in the complainant's communication of 20 December 2021), the Government asserts that these are false and indicates: (i) that Mr Zamora is not a union leader nor is he known to have any labour ties; (ii) that neither he, nor his son, nor his wife have been victims of threats, detentions, harassment, persecution or harassment; (iii) that this citizen is a repeat offender of false accusations against the Cuban authorities; and (iv)聽that it is increasingly difficult for the Government to be able to respond to the Committee on facts that have not even occurred, and the complainants should be asked to demonstrate the veracity of the information they transmit to the Committee.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141424, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee once again recalls that, within the terms of its mandate, it is empowered to examine the extent to which the exercise of trade union rights may be affected in cases of allegations of the infringement of public freedoms. The Committee also recalls that it is not competent to consider purely political allegations; it can, however, consider measures of a political character taken by governments in so far as these may affect the exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, the Committee considers that Organizations responsible for defending workers socio-economic and occupational interests should be able to use strike action to support their position in the search for solutions to problems posed by major social and economic policy trends which have a direct impact on their members and on workers in general, in particular as regards employment, social protection and standards of living. While purely political strikes do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association, trade unions should be able to have recourse to protest strikes, in particular where aimed at criticizing a government鈥檚 economic and social policies [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, paras 22, 24, 759 and 763].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141424, response status: 200"

The Committee also recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since this is the first step that workers鈥?or employers鈥?organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately; and a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation, paras 449, 463 and 666]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers, and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee secondly recalls that that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, para. 330]. The Committee reiterates that in its initial examination of this case, it noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its central objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members鈥?duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers鈥?claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC鈥檚 declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers鈥?organization. The Committee can only regret that there has been no progress since its last examination of this case and therefore once again refers to its previous conclusions and, once again, strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141424, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee has been requesting the Government to investigate these allegations. The Committee observes with concern that, in its further allegations, the complainants report new violations of civil liberties, including arbitrary arrests, assault, threats and harassment, as well as persecution and, in one case, a criminal conviction, by the public authorities, against the following trade union officials and members: Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene S谩nchez, Ms Consuelo Rodr铆guez Hern谩ndez and Ms Mail铆n Ricardo G贸ngora; and Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, Mr Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Mr Ram贸n Zamora Rodr铆guez, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Humberto Bello Lafita and Mr Ulises Rafael Hern谩ndez L贸pez. The Committee recalls that the rights of workers鈥?and employers鈥?organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee further recalls that the detention of trade unionists for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular [see Compilation, paras 84 and 123].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141424, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee must emphasize that the right to a fair and public hearing implies the right for the ruling or decision to be made public and that the publicizing of decisions is an important safeguard in the interest of the individual and of society at large. The Committee also hopes that the Government will understand that, given the contradictory information received from the parties, and the fact that it has been denied access to the relevant court rulings, it cannot abandon its examination of the allegations concerned. The Committee recalls in this regard, that, on numerous occasions where the complainants alleged that trade union officials or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments鈥?replies amounted to general denials of the allegation or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof, and the outcome of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations [see Compilation, paras 178 and 179].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141424, response status: 200"

The apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involves a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights [see Compilation, paras 132 and 128].

The Committee also notes that, in its most recent allegations, the complainant organization reports cyber sabotage carried out by the public authorities to prevent ASIC trade unionists from participating in international online events with other trade union organizations. The Committee observes in this regard that the Government also considers that these are false allegations and unfounded accusations, and that the restrictions on access to the Internet and information technology are due to the blockade imposed on the country. The Committee also notes that the complainant organization alleges that the reported restrictions cannot be considered as limitations on access that apply to all persons in the country, and emphasizes that such limitations were targeted at specific events and individuals, and that in other cases, there were no problems in accessing these Internet communication services.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141424, response status: 200"

The Government considers that these practices go against the spirit of dialogue and cooperation for the effective promotion of workers鈥?rights, undermine tripartism and do not help improve the situation of workers in the world. Furthermore, it considers that these negative practices are inconsistent with the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectiveness that should prevail in the handling of trade union freedoms.

The Committee recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since that is the first step that workers鈥?or employers鈥?organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation, paras 449 and 666]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee recalls that all workers, regardless of their status, should be guaranteed their freedom of association rights so as to avoid the possibility of having their precarious situation taken advantage of [see Compilation, para. 329]. The Committee recalls that in its initial examination of this case, it noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its central objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members鈥?duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers鈥?claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC鈥檚 declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers鈥?organization. The Committee therefore refers to its previous conclusions and, once again, strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081842, response status: 200"

The Government indicates that the recommendations made by the Committee in its previous examination of the case are a reflection of the persistence of selective practices and political manipulation in the ILO鈥檚 working methods and supervisory bodies against developing countries. The Government considers that these practices go against the spirit of dialogue and cooperation for the effective promotion of workers鈥?rights, undermine tripartism and do not help improve the situation of workers in the world. Furthermore, it considers that these negative practices are inconsistent with the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectiveness that should prevail in the handling of trade union freedoms.

In addition, he was twice prosecuted for illicit economic activities. With regard to action taken against him by the immigration authorities, this was because of his past record of antisocial and criminal behaviour. He has never been arrested, but simply interviewed, fully respecting the guarantees provided by law;(c)	Mr Jorge Anglada Mayeta was not beaten up by a police officer while trying to defend a self-employed worker. Mr Anglada pounced on and assaulted a police officer carrying out his duties without prior warning or legitimate cause, which constitutes an offence in criminal legislation throughout the world. On 16 February 2018, the Municipal People鈥檚 Court of La Habana Vieja, having respected all guarantees of due process, found him guilty of assault and sentenced him to two years鈥?imprisonment with a restriction of liberty order for an equal period of time;(d)	Mr V铆ctor Manuel Dom铆nguez Garc铆a, Mr Wilfredo 脕lvarez Garc铆a, Mr B谩rbaro de la Nuez Ram铆rez, Mr Alexis G贸mez Rodr铆guez, Mr聽Roberto Arsenio L贸pez Ramos and Mr Charles Enchris Rodr铆guez Ledezma were prosecuted following allegations relating to acts classified as offences under Cuban legislation (illicit economic activities, illegal gambling, possession of psychotropic substances, speculation and hoarding, possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, usurpation of public office, handling stolen goods, contempt, causing serious injury, damage, forgery of documents and public disorder). Given that domestic legislation allows for conduct of low risk to society to be subject to administrative proceedings, the authorities handled the above as minor offences;(e)	criminal proceedings were not instituted against Mr Eduardo Enrique Hern谩ndez Toledo because he was allegedly exercising his trade union rights, and neither did the authorities commit any acts of persecution or harassment against him. The aforementioned person is not a trade union leader and has never been subjected to harassment or pressure by the authorities. He was prosecuted by the People鈥檚 Municipal Court of Trinidad for contempt and sentenced to a one-year prison term with custodial hard labour, and is currently out on parole;(f)	Mr Yoanny Limonta Garc铆a, who is also not a union official and has no employment relationship, was subjected to police checks because of his repeated commission of acts classified as offences and other antisocial behaviour (in 2011 for speculation, in 2013 for possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, and in 2016 for usurpation of public office);(g)	Mr Mateo Moreno Ram贸n and Mr Leandro Vladimir Aguilera Pe帽a were not arrested; they simply received warnings from the relevant authorities, in strict compliance with the law, to prevent them from carrying out their criminal intentions;(h)	the restrictions on the right to free movement of Mr Osvaldo Rodr铆guez D铆az and Mr聽Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var were implemented in accordance with current migration legislation. Mr S谩nchez Zald铆var has had no employment relationship since 2013 and has a long history of violation of existing rules, regulations and laws, including allegations of illegal economic activities and disobedience. The allegations of threats and harassment against him and his wife are also untrue. Mr S谩nchez Zald铆var has participated in several trade union events and workshops abroad funded by a foreign power. In 2018, as part of his activities against Cuba, he travelled to Geneva in the context of the 107th International Labour Conference. During the current year, his freedom to travel has not been arbitrarily restricted and the authorities have acted only in accordance with migration law(i)	Ms Magela Garc茅s Ram铆rez wrote and disseminated an article in which she made serious and groundless accusations against a significant number of artists and art institutions and, given the seriousness of the allegations, her employer decided that she should work for a different art collection, which is why she decided to resign from her post; and(j)	Ms Sara Cuba Delgado was not subjected to surveillance and harassment by state officials.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

The fact that workers do not use this mechanism is not due to a legislative prohibition but to the fact that they have the option of resorting to other more effective means at their disposal, including a number of different forms of meaningful participation and the exercise of genuine decision-making power on matters that concern them. Furthermore, the protection of trade union officials against any acts of anti-union discrimination, including with respect to the exercise of the right to strike, is governed by section 16 of the 2013 Labour Code, which provides that trade union officials have all the guarantees necessary to carry out their functions and ensures their protection against transfers, disciplinary action, anti-union dismissals or other measures affecting their working conditions imposed on them because of their trade union work.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

In particular, it notes that the Government considers that the allegations put forward by the complainant are part of campaigns of political manipulation to discredit Cuba, financed externally and in contravention of the principles of sovereignty, self determination and non-interference in domestic affairs; and that the Committee鈥檚 conclusions in the previous examination of the case are a reflection of the persistence of selective practices and political manipulation in the ILO鈥檚 working methods and supervisory bodies against developing countries. In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall that, within the terms of its mandate, it is empowered to examine to what extent the exercise of trade union rights may be affected in cases of allegations of the infringement of civil liberties [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, para. 22]. The Committee also recalls that it is not competent to consider purely political allegations; it can, however, consider measures of a political character taken by governments in so far as these may affect the exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 24].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

While taking due note of the Government鈥檚 reply, the Committee observes, firstly, that for several decades it has been examining allegations of non-recognition and interference by the Government in the free operation of trade union organizations not affiliated to the CTC [see Case Nos 1198, 1628, 1805, 1961 and 2258 of the Committee on Freedom of Association]. The Committee recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since that is the first step that workers鈥?or employers鈥?organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation, op. cit., paras 449 and 666]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee recalls, secondly, that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 330]. In light of the foregoing, the Committee refers to its previous conclusions and urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

It also recalls that in many cases, it has asked the government concerned to communicate the texts of any judgments that have been delivered together with the grounds adduced therefor. [see Compilation, op. cit., paras聽178 and 179].

The Committee recalls that, while persons engaged in trade union activities or holding trade union office cannot claim immunity in respect of the ordinary criminal law, trade union activities should not in themselves be used by the public authorities as a pretext for the arbitrary arrest or detention of trade unionists. The apprehension and systematic or arbitrary interrogation by the police of trade union leaders and unionists involves a danger of abuse and could constitute a serious attack on trade union rights [see Compilation, op. cit., paras 132 and 128]. The Committee therefore urges the Government to ensure, in the light of the decisions mentioned in its conclusions, that an investigation is made into all the allegations of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms made in relation to the above-mentioned persons and to provide the Committee with detailed information on each of these matters and on the outcome (with copies of decisions or rulings) of any administrative or judicial proceedings instituted in relation to the aforementioned allegations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

It also emerges from the allegations communicated by the complainant that the public authorities had imposed restrictions on the right to free movement on members of ASIC and affiliated unions with a view to preventing their participation in trade union meetings or public demonstrations in the national territory.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that subsections (d), (e), (f) and聽(h) of article 25 of the Migration Act (Act No. 1312 of 1976, as amended by Decree Law No. 302 of 2012), which prohibit persons from leaving national territory 鈥?d)聽when national defence and security render it advisable; (e) [when] they have obligations with respect to the Cuban State or civil responsibilities, provided that these have been expressly stipulated by the relevant authorities; (f) [when] they do not have the required authorization, pursuant to the laws aimed at maintaining a qualified workforce for the country鈥檚 economic, social, technical and scientific development, and for the security and protection of official information, 鈥?(h) when for other reasons of public interest the competent authorities so decide鈥? grant a broad discretionary power to the public authorities to determine whether a person can travel outside the country, which could have an impact on the right of union officials of ASIC and other trade unions not affiliated to the CTC to organize and carry out their trade union activities freely. The Committee has highlighted that trade unionists, just like all persons, should enjoy freedom of movement. In particular, they should enjoy the right, subject to national legislation, which should not be such so as to violate freedom of association principles, to participate in trade union activities abroad [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 190]. The Committee recalls the special importance it attaches to the right of workers鈥?and employers鈥?representatives to attend and to participate in meetings of international workers鈥?and employers鈥?organizations and of the ILO [see聽Compilation, op. cit., para. 1069]. Regretting the Government鈥檚 indication that the presence of a trade union leader at the International Labour Conference in 2018 constitutes an act of this leader against the Cuban Government,, the Committee expects the Government to refrain from unduly restricting the right of ASIC officials and members to organize and carry out their union activities freely, including when these are held outside the country.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

While noting the diverging versions of events of the Government and complainant, the Committee is bound to recall that the restriction of a person鈥檚 movements to a limited area, accompanied by the prohibition of entry into the area in which his or her union operates and in which he or she normally carries on trade union functions, is inconsistent with the normal enjoyment of the right to association and with the exercise of the right to carry on trade union activities and functions [see Compilation, op., cit. para.聽200]. The Committee therefore firmly expects the Government to fully ensure that ASIC officials have the freedom of movement in the national territory required to carry out their trade union activities without Government interference.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017622, response status: 200"

The alleged aggression includes arrests of trade unionists, threats of prosecution, physical assaults, raids on private houses, trials and convictions of union leaders, dismissals, cases of short-term but systematic detention, travel bans, as well as the use of legal proceedings involving the constant threat of imprisonment, the confiscation of trade union property and the dismissal of workers for their union activities, including just for attendance at union training sessions. The specific allegations by ASIC can be summarized as follows:(a)	On 6 November 2015, Mr Kelvin Vega Rizo, the secretary of the Independent Mine Workers Union affiliated to the CTIC, was dismissed from his post at the former 鈥淩en茅 Ramos Latour鈥?nickel processing plant, where he had worked as a plumber for over 23聽years. According to Mr Vega Rizo, officials of the Department of State Security (DSE) ordered the company management to dismiss him following his attendance at a trade union training course at the University of Latin American Workers (UTAL) in Panama.(b)	On 9 December 2015, plain-clothes officers from the secret political police arrested Mr聽Osvaldo Arcis Hern谩ndez, an independent trade unionist belonging to the Escambray Independent Trade Union, in the municipality of Trinidad and took him into custody. Nine days later he was tried in summary judicial proceedings and sentenced to two years鈥?imprisonment further to the charge of being a danger to society. He was denied any choice of defence counsel and the authorities provided him with a court-appointed lawyer instead. Before his arrest, he had been physically assaulted and received written threats of imprisonment if he did not give up his independent trade union activities. He was granted conditional release on Friday, 19 August 2016 and was warned that he faced further imprisonment if he continued his independent trade union activities.(c)	On 6 January 2016, the joint authorities of the Ministry of the Interior and the DSE raided the residence of independent trade unionist Mr B谩rbaro Tejeda S谩nchez in Holgu铆n. The police conducted a thorough search of the property and confiscated a laptop, a mobile phone, a flash memory device and a camera, without issuing a certificate of confiscation. The Government has not responded to the complaint lodged by the trade union member.(d)	Repeated acts of repression were committed by DSE agents against Mr Pavel Herrera Hern谩ndez, an independent trade unionist, including constant surveillance of his movements and arbitrary detention for short periods (with threats of termination of employment if he did not give up his anti-establishment activities), culminating in dismissal from his post. On 8 April 2016, he was dismissed from his job as a dockworker which he had performed for over eight years, with the management alleging unjustified absences, specifically on 9 and 22 March 2016, even though both of these absences were the result of being arrested by DSE agents as he was leaving home to go to work (on 22 March, the final day of the visit of the President of the United States, he was held in police custody).(e)	During and prior to the visit of the President of the United States, several CTIC activists were arrested, threatened and beaten up: (i) on 12 March 2016, the general secretary of the Catering Workers鈥?Union, Mr Alexis G贸mez Rodr铆guez, was arrested by DSE officials and police officers as he was leaving his house for work and was taken into police custody. He was released after 8.30 p.m., having been warned to stay at home for the duration of the US President鈥檚 visit; (ii) on 17 March 2016, Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, the CTIC general secretary, was arrested in Col贸n by nearly a dozen police officers, who kicked him to the ground, damaged his clothes and shoes, and forcibly took him into police custody. They later issued a warning for an alleged disturbance of public order and released him on payment of a fine. The following day, they arrested him again and warned him that during the visit of the US President his freedom of movement was restricted; and (iii) other trade union activists, including Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi and Mr Ra煤l Zerguera Borrell, were issued official warnings and placed under temporary house arrest.(f)	On 31 July 2016, on his return to Cuba after a work-related trip, Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo (now ASIC general secretary) was arrested with force at the airport, taken into police custody and reportedly accused of the offence of contempt, before being released without charge the following day. Many of his belongings had been inspected, some damaged and others stolen, including a radio, 15 compact discs containing ILO Conventions and other ILO documents, as well as t-shirts and stickers considered by the regime to be 鈥渆nemy propaganda鈥? In the wake of this situation, a number of international bodies 鈥?including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) 鈥?publicly called for an end to these abuses.(g)	On 20 September 2016, several trade union activists from CONIC, the CUTC and the CTIC were arrested and others were kept under house arrest by the secret police to prevent them from holding a peaceful assembly aimed at establishing a broad independent trade union coalition. Those arrested included: (i) CUTC general secretary Mr Alejandro S谩nchez Zald铆var, who was arrested in the early hours on the same day as he was leaving his house, taken to a judicial office and questioned by DSE officials before being dropped off far from home; (ii) Ms Ariadna Mena Rubio (of the CTIC), who was held in police custody and released eight hours later, following intensive questioning; (iii) Ms Hilda Aylin L贸pez Salazar (CONIC), who was taken to Police Unit No. 3 of Havana and subjected to heavy interrogation; and (iv) trade unionists Ms聽Aim茅e de las Mercedes Cabrera 脕lvarez (CUTC), Mr Reinaldo Cosano Al茅n (CONIC) and Mr V铆ctor Manuel Dom铆nguez Garc铆a (National Trade Union Training Centre 鈥?CNCS) were prohibited from leaving their homes, having been informed that they would otherwise face arrest.(h)	On 22 September 2016, CTIC activist Mr Felipe Carrera Hern谩ndez was arrested at home by the national police and taken to a police station, where he was questioned for two hours by plain-clothes secret police officers about his work-related and trade union activities. He was released after being subjected to serious threats.(i)	On 7 November 2016, Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, an ASIC member, was arrested by DSE officials and the police as he was leaving home, and was then questioned and threatened because of his trade union training activities, before finally being released around midday.(j)	On 14 December 2016, police officers went to the homes of various ASIC members (Mr Pedro Scull, Ms Aim茅e Cabrera and Mr Alejandro S谩nchez) in Havana to warn them that they would not allow the ASIC meeting planned by the secretariat to go ahead, and that general secretary Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo (who lives in Col贸n, some 127 kilometres from Havana) would be imprisoned if he travelled to the capital. One of the police officers who went to the home of Mr Alejandro S谩nchez warned him that he had direct orders from President Ra煤l Castro not to allow further activities by the opposition.(k)	On 27 December 2016, two secret police officers stopped independent trade union member Mr Mateo Moreno Ram贸n in the street and proceeded to intimidate him and inquire into his trade union activities.(l)	On the night of 28 December 2016, ASIC general secretary Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo, on returning to his home in Col贸n from Havana with Ms Caridad Burunate G贸mez, a member of the Damas de Blanco (ladies in white) opposition movement, was subjected to an attempted violent robbery and brutal assault by four secret police officers, who reportedly identified themselves just afterwards. Both activists were subsequently detained, subjected to a thorough body search and inspection of their belongings, and later released without charge. In the afternoon of the same day, trade union activist Mr Felipe Carrera Hern谩ndez was arrested and released two hours later.(m)	On 30 December 2016, Mr Emilio Alberto Gottardi Gottardi, an ASIC provincial delegate in Havana, was visited at home by two plain-clothes secret police officers to warn him about his activities and restrict his movements during the New Year festivities.(n)	On 22 January 2017, the immigration authorities, alleging a breach of migration regulations, placed a travel ban on Mr Ra煤l Domingo Zerguera Borrell, a trade unionist who had been invited to UTAL for a seminar on the current situation and outlook for the organization of workers in the informal economy. The trade unionist was ordered in a threatening tone, allegedly by an officer of the secret police, to leave the area, and was arrested on his return to Havana and held for an hour at a police station in central Havana.(o)	On the morning of 30 January 2017, the home of independent trade unionist Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras was raided without warning in a joint operation by the Ministry of the Interior and the DES, which conducted a painstaking search, resulting in the confiscation of two laptops, a camera, a typewriter, a mobile phone and various written complaints to the State, as well as other documents of the organization. Ultimately, the independent trade union member was taken into custody and held for six hours at an office of the Ministry of the Interior in the town of Cruces. Here he was subjected to intense interrogation about his trade union activities and his free legal advisory service relating to labour issues, in which he advises citizens on the drafting of complaints in accordance with their constitutional rights. The authorities opened a judicial file against the trade unionist for alleged abuse of public office, an offence which he was told is punishable with imprisonment of one to three years. He was finally released and warned that his freedom of movement was restricted until the pre-trial hearing.(p)	On 5 February 2017, ASIC general secretary Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo was beaten up and then detained after attempting to take photos as state security personnel arrested his mother, Dama de Blanco member Ms Asunci贸n Carrillo Hern谩ndez. They handcuffed him and took him to Col贸n police station. He was released four hours later with a fine, reportedly having been accused of causing public disorder and issued with a warning.(q)	On 23 February 2017, independent trade unionists Mr L谩zaro Ricardo P茅rez (a member of the ASIC leadership) and Mr Hiosvani Pupo were prohibited from travelling to Havana, thereby preventing their attendance at ASIC meetings.(r)	On 28 March 2017, state security personnel and police officers raided the home of independent trade union journalist Mr Yoanny Limonta Garc铆a. Following a thorough search, he was arrested and taken to the municipal police station, where he was questioned and later released after being warned that he faced imprisonment if he continued his activities.(s)	On 29 March 2017, ASIC general secretary Mr Iv谩n Hern谩ndez Carrillo was arrested during his trip to Havana and placed in a small police cell with deplorable sanitary conditions, where he was held for ten hours without charge. The police report states that he was arrested for opposition activities. He was finally released but the police kept his identity documents in their possession.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950237, response status: 200"

The Government considers that, by not having an employment relationship or being part of any labour collective, these persons have not been elected by workers to represent them, and it considers this a prerequisite enshrined in Article 3 of Convention No. 135 for their recognition as representatives. The Government alleges that these persons work for the external entities financing them with the objective of subverting the legally established internal order, in line with foreign agendas for regime change. In this respect, the Government indicates that the supposed leaders are funded by the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba, which in turn receives funds from the National Endowment for Democracy in the United States. The Government also provides examples of the activities performed by several of the individuals referred to in the complaint, highlighting trips outside the country to receive funds and instructions, the perpetration of various types of common crimes, the submission of complaints regarding issues unrelated to labour, and the absence of employment relationships or of the application of disciplinary measures for repeated breaches of labour discipline or for declarations of unfitness for work.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950237, response status: 200"

In this regard, it indicates that the CTC and its 16 national sectoral unions represent the interests of a total of 3,249,988 members (96.4 per cent of the workers) and that they have all the guarantees necessary to carry out their trade union work, such as not being obliged to register in order to secure recognition. The Government also states that the scope of the exercise of trade union rights is in full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos 87, 98 and 135 and is much broader than in other countries. This is reflected in the recognition of the workers鈥?right to organize voluntarily and to establish trade unions, in conformity with fundamental unitary principles and their own constitutions and rules, in the privileged role occupied by the trade unions in the political life of the country (recalling that the CTC has recognized authority to initiate legislative proposals), and in the legal protection afforded to the trade unions, with heavy penalties for any parties which seek to impede the proper exercise of labour rights. The Government also emphasizes that employment relationships in the context of foreign investment are governed by existing national legislative provisions and that workers in this sector, like all other workers in Cuba, have the right to organize and to bargain collectively, and that they exercise those rights fully. Furthermore, the Government states that Decree Law No. 313 of 2013 concerning the ZEDM establishes that companies and users must respect the country鈥檚 labour and social security provisions, and trade unions have therefore existed in the ZEDM since its creation (and it recalls that none of the supposed trade union activists or leaders referred to in the complaint have an employment relationship in the zone in question and therefore do not represent its workers).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950237, response status: 200"

Moreover, the Committee observes that ASIC declares in its constitution that its key objectives include unifying the independent unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Its constitution also refers to the duty of ASIC members to defend workers鈥?claims and benefits. Consequently, even though the Committee observes, on the one hand, that the Government questions the actions and representativeness of ASIC (describing it as an organization for political opposition and not for the defence or representation of the workers), the Committee duly notes, on the other hand, the activities that ASIC claims that its activist leaders undertake to promote the principles of freedom of association (through examples and specific situations described in the allegations of aggression and discrimination on account of union activities in various places in the country) and, with regard to the ASIC founding and regulatory documents, observes that the aspects of the ASIC declaration of principles and constitution referred to above come within the sphere of action and the definition of a workers鈥?organization.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950237, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee, while observing the differences between the statements of the parties, is bound to recall the following: that both elected representatives and trade union representatives (namely, those appointed or elected by the unions or their members) may be considered representatives of the workers; that freedom of association is a right of all workers, and not just those who are in a specific employment relationship; and that workers and their organizations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, so that the absence or disappearance of an employment relationship should not necessarily affect the status and functions of representatives from workers鈥?organizations, unless the constitutions of the organizations specify differently; otherwise, the abovementioned right would be restricted, leaving such organizations without leadership should their representatives be dismissed.

Moreover, they stopped all people trying to enter the building, asking for their identification and the reason why they were coming to that place.

The WCL highlights that a number of trade union officials belonging to CUTC, among whom was Pedro Pablo Alvarez, Secretary-General of CUTC, were wrongly detained and sentenced to a number of years in prison. The sentences applied to Pedro Pablo Alvarez, Oscar Espinosa Chepe and Carmelo D铆az Fern谩ndez, were for 25, 20 and 15 years鈥?imprisonment, respectively. Added to this is the confiscation of trade union materials found in the CUTC library. Harassment against members of CUTC, according to the WCL, is not a recent event.

This demand was upheld by the appropriate court. Mr. Chepe is a self-styled member of the national executive committee of the non-existent CUTC. Through Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, he has similar links with the terrorist organizations of Cuban origin in Miami and with United States federal agencies, the intelligence services, among others. He is paid to fabricate false information against the Cuban political system and economy. He has actively worked to prevent foreign investment in Cuba.

He has a comprehensive history of anti-social behaviour and is involved in illegal activities such as the trafficking and sale of dollars and the illegal resale of products stolen from businesses in the country.

He lived on payments from terrorist groups of Cuban origin in Miami and from the United States Government for his subversive activities against Cuban constitutional order. He was warned on a number of occasions, in accordance with Cuban legislation, by the appropriate authorities, with regard to his participation and organization of illegal and damaging activities against constitutional order, including a number of activities against public order.

He swindled a number of people, to whom he offered 鈥済uarantees鈥?that their requests to emigrate to the United States would be accepted in exchange for which he would use their signatures to support counter-revolutionary plans to subvert Cuban constitutional order, accepted in a referendum by more than 97 per cent of the Cuban population.

He carried out a number of activities aimed at increasing the negative impact of the blockade. He maintained regular links with the United States Interests Section in Havana, from which he received materials and instructions for his subversive activities.

Ms. Gladys Linares Blanco, after blatantly and publicly stealing received money, had to be kept away from 鈥渢rade union business鈥? following instructions given by agents in Havana defending the interests of a foreign State.

Unemployed since 2000, when he voluntarily left the Provincial Directorate of Physical Planning of Pinar del R铆o, where he worked as a designer. He has close links with the terrorist organization, the Cuban American National Foundation. He is described as a 鈥渢hief鈥?by his fellow counter-revolutionaries because on repeated occasions he has stolen money sent from abroad for his own personal use. In September 2001, he was accused of abusing minors after beating his wife鈥檚 son on two occasions, causing after-effects, and threatening another child who was present at the time. On 14 February 2002, the chief of agents in Havana defending the interests of a foreign State visited him at his home and rewarded his criminal activities with additional funding and 40 radio receivers with their respective chargers, four batteries, a ground antenna and earphones. Naturally, she also informed him of new activities for consolidating the 鈥渧irtual trade unionism鈥?that this foreign State is trying to create.鈥?Mr. Sixto Rolando Calero Ramos. Unemployed for health reasons since 1997, when he presented a medical certificate. He was paid his salary in full for the next two years. In 1998, he began to receive 50 per cent of his usual salary and will continue to do so until November 2002, when he will have to submit a new medical expertise in accordance with labour legislation. He had previously been dismissed from the Ministry of Education, where he worked as a teacher, following criminal acts of a sexual nature against students from the school where he worked.

Accordingly, the law must not institutionalize a de facto monopoly. Even where at some point all workers have preferred to unify the trade union movement, they should still remain free to set up unions outside the established structure, should they so wish (see General Survey of 1994 on freedom of association and collective bargaining, paragraph 96).Article 3 of the Convention.

The Department of State Security (DSE) renewed its harassment of CUTC members, with a view to preventing a second preparatory meeting, due to be held on 8 August, from taking place.

Before it took place, early in the morning of 12 October, state security agents arrested Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, general secretary of the CUTC, as he was leaving home. He was later released in the evening of the same day. While he was under arrest, security agents attempted to coerce him into abandoning both the plans to hold a press conference on the following day, and the preparations for the congress. On the morning of 13 October, Mr. Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos and his colleagues travelled to the place where the press conference was due to be held at 11 a.m. (627 calle San Francisco, between 12 and 13 October, 10 de Octubre District, Havana Province), but found it completely surrounded by state security agents.

In the absence of a labour relations framework, it is impossible to describe the persons concerned as union representatives, given that they neither represent nor lead any body of workers in any of the recognized workplaces throughout the country. In Cuba, 98 per cent of the workforce are affiliated to central trade union organizations which group together 19 national sectoral unions. In response to the doubts cast by the WCL on the freedom of workers to establish trade unions of their own choosing, there are 19 national sectoral trade unions in Cuba, all freely established by the workers, which were neither imposed by law, nor introduced by force, pressure, repression or violence from the public authorities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904637, response status: 200"

It was subsequently endorsed by all trade union congresses. There is no climate of violence, pressure or intimidation in Cuba, as is demonstrated by the workers鈥?participation in the aforementioned trade union activities, and by the rate of union membership, which stands at 98 per cent.

In this regard, the Committee stresses that the CUTC is affiliated to CLAT and WCL, international trade union organizations, that over 400 signatures of Cuban workers are contained in the annexes to the membership application to the WCL (sent by the complainant), and that the annexes also include a communication sent by the CUTC in 1995 to the Register of Inscriptions of the Ministry of Justice, seeking ""to be entered in the corresponding register of inscriptions"" and subsequently mentioning four workplaces; the Committee also points out that the allegations by the WCL relate to events surrounding the organization of a national congress.

The Committee draws the Government鈥檚 attention to the fact that ""the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility of forming, in a climate of full security, organizations independent both of those which exist already and of any political party"" and that ""the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 1996, paras. 273 and 71].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904637, response status: 200"

Inside the aforementioned premises, the officer threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Ms. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, Officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"";- on 2 August 1994, on Avenida 19 of the Siboney district, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. L谩zaro Corp Yeras, General Secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men.

This is the case of Juan Guarino Mart铆nez Guill茅n (President), Jes煤s C谩rdenas L贸pez (Vice-President) and Ren茅 Jos茅 Montero Garay (Secretary responsible for International Relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration;- on 29 September 1994, at 1 p.m., Mr. Ren茅 Jos茅 Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones at the corner of Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that he himself and Mart铆nez Guill茅n and Jes煤s C谩rdenas would be sentenced to 12 and 15 years' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued defending the Cuban working class. Moreover, on 10 November 1994, at 2.40 p.m., Mr. Juan Guarino Mart铆nez Guill茅n, President of the CTDC, and Mr. Jes煤s C谩rdenas L贸pez, Vice-President of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation;- according to the complainant organization's sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was small in quantity and of very poor quality.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903310, response status: 200"

This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On 24 May, she was summoned to the 9th station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in the Capri district, and was given a warning for having carried provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August 1994;- as regards L谩zaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. L谩zaro Corp Yeras left the country in September 1994, when he went to live in the United States;- the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question;- there are 18 national sectoral trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around 98 per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903310, response status: 200"

There were no acts of violence, only a public scandal, disrupting neighbourly relations. The Government adds that the warning in question was issued in accordance with procedural law, at a meeting with police instructors at which the person is informed of the offence and warned not to repeat it. It is not true that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque was placed in a cell or subjected to a body search. She spent a short period of time in the police office, only in order to comply with the established procedures.

These measures were imposed in accordance with the labour legislation in force, and the worker submitted to them without availing himself of the remedies laid down in the legislation.

On the other hand, the Government denies that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque is a trade union official or member, that she was held in a cell and that she was subjected to a body search, and emphasizes that the reason for the warning was offensive statements (the Government does not indicate the content of these statements) which provoked a scandal among her neighbours. In view of the discrepancy between the complainant's and the Government's versions, the Committee points out the principle that ""measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th (revised) edition, 1996, para. 77).

The Government alleged that Mr. Gutierrez was still subject to a sentence resulting from his opposition to the Government; the real reason for the refusal was that for the last two years he had been trying to secure official recognition of the USTC, and had been imprisoned for that reason, but released following pressure brought to bear by the international trade union movement. The non-recognition of the USTC was examined by the Committee in its 287th Report (Case No. 1628), paras. 280-282).

The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU.

The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. The Government states that it is incorrect that Juan Jos茅 L贸pez Diaz and Wilmer Lazaro Mora Beltran were the victims of a violent demonstration or that they were at the residence of the said Enid Amelia Luque when a group of neighbours from the district reacted against the provocations of the above-mentioned citizen.

Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers.

The Committee must therefore take into account the fact that there exists only one officially recognized central trade union organization mentioned in the legislation and that on previous occasions, complaints have been made concerning the refusal to grant official recognition to trade union organizations outside the existing officially recognized trade union structure. In the same way, in its last report (1995), the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations requested the Government ""to guarantee in law and in practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article 2 of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom"" (see Report III (Part 4A), ILC, 82nd Session, 1995, p. 163).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903312, response status: 200"

In this respect, observing that the Government has not indicated the specific allegations made against Mr. Gutierrez in the criminal proceedings and bearing in mind that the Government has not denied the statement by the complainant organization that this person was imprisoned for trying to obtain official recognition of the Union of Workers of Cuba, the Committee concludes that the authorities refused Mr. Gutierrez permission to leave the country to attend ICFTU meetings because of proceedings related to the carrying out of legitimate trade union activities. The Committee therefore deplores that Mr. Gutierrez was not permitted to attend two meetings organized by the ICFTU and requests the Government in future to guarantee respect of the principle whereby ""since participation by unionists in international trade union meetings is a fundamental trade union right, governments should abstain from any measure ... that would prevent representatives of workers' organizations from exercising their mandate in full freedom and independence"".

The Committee wishes to emphasize that the complainant organization did not say that the injuries to Mr. Corp and his young son were caused by ""members of the Ministry of the Interior"", but by persons who had links ""with the Cuban security forces""; moreover, the complainant organization pointed out that this was the fifth act of aggression against Mr. Corp in less than three months. In this respect, the Committee believes that the terms in which the Government's reply is worded do not exclude the possibility that Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son were assaulted and injured because of the trade union status or activities of the former. The Committee therefore requests the Government in future to ensure that no trade union official or trade unionist should be assaulted because of his or her trade union status or activities, and of course neither should his or her family members. The Committee requests the Government to set up a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries inflicted on the trade union official Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son despite the fact that they no longer live in Cuba, and to keep it informed in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903312, response status: 200"

In a communication dated 16 December 1993, the Government had criticized the recommendations made by the Committee and indicated, in particular, that the case lacked legal objectivity because the request initially made by Mr. Rafael Gutierrez Santos to the Minister of Justice (request for registration of a so-called trade union organization) was abandoned by a letter of 1 April 1992, which had been transmitted to the Committee. At its meeting in March 1994, the Committee took note of the Government's observations and decided to transmit them to the complainant organization so that it might provide any comments or information that it considered to be useful in this respect, and in particular, any documents proving effectively the request for registration of the organization concerned.

Recognition of the USTC as a trade union organization has still not been granted. Nevertheless, the activities of the organization have not been paralysed and its members elected a new executive committee on 13 September 1994. Furthermore, the ICFTU states that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez Santos had not requested the withdrawal of his request for registration, but had simply informed the Government of the change in the organization's name. In its communication of 31 May 1996, the ICFTU indicated that the USTC has still not been recognized, although it is prospering and has affiliates in many provinces of the country. The USTC claims to have 3,000 members. The ICFTU adds that Mr. Pedro Rubio Balbun, president of the USTC, has been the victim of a search by the Policy Police at his home, which is also the headquarters of the organization, and of a seizure of all documentation and of the basic resources indispensable to the proper functioning of the trade union organization.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902357, response status: 200"

This so-called trade union organization is not present in any work centre in the country and its officers have not been elected by any workers' collective. This situation leads one to believe that the Committee should limit itself to the contents of Convention No. 87 on freedom of association and the right to organize which protects workers in the exercise of their trade union rights and not persons who invoke the Convention, without fulfilling the minimum requirements for exercising a true trade union activity, by using a false image of unionists towards other ends.

The Committee deplores the fact that, since 1992, the USTC has not been legally recognized by the authorities, a matter which has nothing to do with its degree of representativeness. It insists that this independent organization, outside of the existing recognized trade union structure, be registered and allowed to function fully without discrimination. The Committee observes with concern that another case concerning Cuba (No. 1805) examined in this report also concerns the denial of recognition of an independent trade union organization. The Committee refers to the conclusions formulated in this case and in particular to the comments of the Committee of Experts requesting the Government ""to guarantee in law and practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, to establish independent organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing recognized trade union structure if they so desire (Article 2 of Convention No. 87) and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (Article 3 of Convention No. 87).""

In the circumstances, while noting that according to the Government Mr. Guti茅rrez has been released from detention, the Committee recalls that ""the arrest - even if only briefly - of trade union leaders and trade unionists for exercising legitimate trade union activities constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, 3rd edition, 1985, para. 88).

In the Committee's opinion, it seems that the certificate of recognition was requested by Mr. Guti茅rrez with the express aim of being able subsequently to request legal registration for the new trade union, and he thus seemingly embarked on a procedure obviously with the aim of registering a new trade union body. The Committee observes, moreover, that from the documentation included by the Government it seems that, although Mr. Guti茅rrez in effect asked for the UGTC registration application to be discounted, this was merely due to the fact that he wished to change the name of the association to the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902352, response status: 200"

He was then taken away in a vehicle without number plates to the tenth police station in the 10 October District in La Havana, where he was held in solitary confinement. His relatives were not allowed to see him and were told that he would be detained for a long time.

The Committee also deplores the fact that the Government also failed to provide information on the allegations concerning the violent attack against Mr. Rafael Guti茅rrez, founder and president of the UGTC. In these circumstances, the Committee must point out that the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing implies, in particular, the effective possibility of forming, in a climate of full security, organisations independent both of those which exist already and of any political party (see 197th Report, Case No. 905 (USSR), para. 635 and 270th Report, Case No. 1500 (China), para. 324).

The Committee also points out that the recriminations and value judgements which the Government makes in a general way against the complainant are not admissible, neither may they be taken into account as part of the procedure of the Committee, which is only authorised to examine complaints against governments and not against workers' or employers' organisations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902353, response status: 200"

The Government wonders how, if it was fully proved that the initial complaint was false, is it possible to regard as valid the supposed link between the four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court and the trade unionists who were arrested, according to the complainant organisations for having intervened voluntarily. The Government points out that Cuban penal legislation grants all accused persons the full right of appeal against the decision of a competent court, and it would therefore be absurd and unnecessary for any third party to intervene voluntarily in order to secure a reversal of any sentence. Moreover, article 62 of the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states: ""Each citizen has the right to lodge complaints and petitions with the authorities and to receive the necessary attention and replies in adequate time and in accordance with the law.""

It states that no one in Cuba is under arrest for trade union or labour activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901010, response status: 200"

It must not be forgotten that the first law promulgated by the revolutionary State was the agrarian reform law, which gave the land of the large estate owners (latifundistas) to the peasants who had been dispossessed by them. Thus, the small farmer has reason to be grateful to the Revolution and is aware of the manner in which the distribution of agricultural produce is carried out in a planned economy. For this reason he is happy to supply part of his crop to the state storage centres, at adequate prices. However, he also has the right to retain part of the fruits of his labour for his own sustenance or to sell it on the free market at a price that the farmer himself may fix. It is therefore meaningless to talk of a protest movement or of alleged imprisonment in this connection.

Likewise, the Constitution guarantees the right of workers, as of the entire Cuban people, to assemble, to hold discussions and to express their opinions freely on all matters affecting them. The Constitution of the Republic not only clearly establishes right of assembly and the right to organise but, furthermore, proclaims that the Cuban State must provide the material means of actually putting these rights into daily practice. As can be seen in the international statistics that are known to the ILO, practically all Cuban workers belong to trade unions which are grouped in the Confederation of Cuban Workers. Furthermore, Cuban penal legislation - which, like the rest of the country's legislation, is scrupulously respected by the Government of the Republic and the law courts of the State - contains no provision whereby citizens could be penalised for activities of a trade union nature.

In the first of these communications the Government states that the complaint is calumnious since none of the supposed ""trade unionists"" ever had the intention of establishing any kind of trade union movement or of creating any type of organisation. The citizens referred to in the communication of the complainant organisation did not even have any labour links at the time of their arrest and trial. Only one of them was working on the family land as a small farmer, the other four being engaged in various illegal activities. The facts which led to their arrest and sentencing in case No. 88/1982 before the Provincial Court, in a trial that was carried out in accordance with the legal provisions in force in the country, are connected with various acts of sabotage, including setting fire to sugar-cane plantations and grazing land, a tobacconist's shop, hayricks, etc. At the time of their arrest they were planning to set fire to big shops and stores in the capital, collecting arms and other equipment to carry out activities of this kind and were beginning to devise plots to attack government leaders. Moreover, the persons in question, who are the subject of the complaint and whose guilt was proved at the trial, admitted to these activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901009, response status: 200"

The first one states that it concerns ""some 200 workers who were trying to organise a strike in the sugar sector and the death of some of them"". The second communication speaks of 50 workers belonging to the State Ministry for Construction, who were working in the ""Lenin Park"" recreation centre and who were trying to establish an independent trade union to defend their interests. These discrepancies, the Government states, merely demonstrate that an attempt is being made, pointlessly, to undermine the prestige of Cuba by inventing a ""case"" of infringement of freedom of association for obvious purposes of propaganda.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901009, response status: 200"

Four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court of Havana are said moreover to have been arrested merely for having interceded on behalf of the five workers referred to. Furthermore, the complainant has alleged that in the Republic of Cuba trade union membership and the payment of membership dues are compulsory, there being only one union per labour centre which, in turn, belongs to a single confederation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901009, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that the judgement describes 26 of the accused persons, including Ezequiel D铆az Rodr铆guez, Jos茅 Luis D铆az Romero, Carlos Garc铆a D铆az, Benito Garc铆a Olivera and Donato Mart铆nez Garc铆a, as ""counter-revolutionary, anti-communist and anti-social elements, who had been organised for some time and devoted themselves to various counter-revolutionary activities inspired by their own ideology and influenced by North American imperialist propaganda and by broadcasts from the United States of America; in 1978 they set up the organisation known as the 'Zapata Group', belonging to the ultra-reactionary terrorist organisation 'Alpha 66' based in Miami in the state of Florida, whose fundamental task is to destroy the economy of the country and create panic among the population so as to create an atmosphere of insecurity with the aim of overthrowing our socialist State by violent means."" The judgement then describes the facts with which the accused persons are charged: ""scattering hooks on roads, setting fire to sugar plantations, starting fires in restaurants, setting fire to or damaging vehicles, setting fire to grazing land, attempting to poison cattle so as to cause large-scale deaths, setting fire to a coffee plant nursery and the food store of the undertaking, setting fire to a tobacconist's shop, sabotage of telephone lines, attempting to set fire to the wooden poles of electric cables and to a high-voltage tower, distribution in public places of a large quantity of counter-revolutionary documents containing libellous and offensive comments against the Commander-in-Chief of the Revolution and signed by the ""Company for Sabotage against Communism"", incitement against the socialist order and the socialist State. The judgement adds that ""these offences of a revolutionary and terrorist nature carried out by the accused persons during the period in question amount to more than 160 acts of sabotage of various kinds, all of which involve the direct or group participation of the accused, Ezequiel D铆az Rodr铆guez, Benito Garc铆a Olivera, Angel Donato Mart铆nez Garcia, Jos茅 Luis D铆az Romero and Carlos Garc铆a D铆az, who played a direct part in almost all the different activities carried out.""","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901009, response status: 200"

As regards the allegation according to which four lawyers and a judge of the People's Court of Havana were arrested merely for interceding on behalf of the five workers who were initially sentenced to death, the Committee notes that the Government has furnished no precise information. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations thereon.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901009, response status: 200"

In this regard the Committee cannot fail to point out on this question that from the point of view of trade union legislation the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been objecting to section 3 of Legislative Decree No. 3 of 1977, designed to set up and maintain a single trade union system, and which expressly mentions the Confederation of Cuban Workers. The Committee of Experts has considered that this provision might constitute an obstacle to the creation of another confederation if the workers so wished and has expressed the hope that the Government will adopt the necessary measures to delete the reference in the legislation to a specific trade union organisation. In these circumstances the Committee endorses the comments made by the Committee of Experts.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901009, response status: 200"

In this regard the Committee notes the Government's statement of 28 September 1983 which describes the allegations of the complainant organisation as calumny and states that it is impossible to reply seriously to supposed events that have no connection with Case No. 1198 and exist only in the imagination of their inventors.

With regard to itself, the O.R.T states that it is composed of exiled Cuban workers from the transport sector and is affiliated with the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.). In its later communications the O.R.T cites specific acts and statements by the government authorities, which, it asserts, prove its allegations to be well founded.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898978, response status: 200"

The complainants also state that in Cuba a system of compulsory labour has been established, contravening, inter alia, the right to free collective bargaining. In Cuba, they add, the workers used to have a say in the negotiations for wage fixing, either directly or in collective agreements or through their representatives on the tripartite minimum wage boards. In 1960, however, the complainants allege, these committees were abolished by the Government, which in 1962 "" prohibited wage fixing by collective agreement, this power remaining from thereon in the hands of the State "". In 1963 and 1964 the Government is said to have established the Communist system of "" wage categories "". The complainants also state that the above-mentioned measures contravene International Labour Conventions on forced labour, minimum wages, etc.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898978, response status: 200"

The Government considers it necessary also to draw attention to "" the highly suspect representation made after so long by the complainant organisation or members thereof in favour of the development and protection of trade union rights and social gains achieved by the workers..."".

The Government considers it necessary to establish, firstly, "" the true character of the complainant organisation, the circumstances surrounding its championing of the matter and the motives of its promoters "". The Government states that the O.R.T is not a national, still less an international, industrial association enjoying consultative status. Nor, the Government states, is this a matter of activities carried on outside Cuban territory by an organisation which might once have existed in Cuba. According to the Government, the allegations emanate from a new entity whose members are neither de facto nor de jure Cuban transport workers which, in the Government's opinion, precludes them from referring to themselves as an industrial association "" for the purposes set forth in I.L.O.

According to the text of the judgment, this offence was committed when the accused, at a date not specified in the judgment, entered the dwelling of a third party, breaking the padlock, and stealing a shirt and some bedclothes. Mrs. Ada Gonz谩lez Gallo was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, for complicity, with eight other persons, in acts which, according to the Council of War, constituted offences against the state authorities and against the stability and unity of the nation, and arson, defined and made punishable by section 157 (paragraph 3), taken in conjunction with section 148, sections 465 (paragraph A) and 128 of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Acts No. 425 of 7 July 1959 and No. 923 of 4 January 1961. In the judgment it is stated to have been proved that Ada Gonz谩lez Gallo was among persons selected by the "" forces of regression "" for the destruction of workplaces, industrial plant, etc., belonging to the nation, and especially a particular department store in Havana, which was set fire to by a co-accused. Mr. Jorge Blanco Ferrando was sentenced, with others, to nine years' rigorous imprisonment, having been accused of belonging to an organisation, not identified in the judgment, dedicated to various counter-revolutionary activities such as the distribution of propaganda, the sale of bonds, carrying arms and explosives and hiding fugitives. The judgment states that some days before 17 April 1961, the date of an armed invasion of the Cuban territory, the accused were engaged in great activity to facilitate the invasion. The Council of War considered that these acts constituted an offence against the state authorities, defined by section 157 (paragraph 3) of the Code of Social Defence as amended by Act No. 425.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898904, response status: 200"

In all these cases the alleged facts on which the sentences were passed, as emerges from the information and the texts of the judgments submitted by the Government, do not appear to bear any relation to trade union activities. From the Government's observations it seems that these cases too were conducted in accordance with the exceptional procedure laid down in the 1896 Act governing trials in the Republic of Cuba under arms, owing to the fact that the offences of which these persons had been accused were regarded as "" counter-revolutionary "".","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898904, response status: 200"

The complainants add that in making these interventions the Ministry of Labour invoked Act No. 907 of 31 December 1961, which empowered the Minister to order the taking of such measures where in his opinion circumstances rendered it necessary for the maintenance in operation of the centres of production. This Act, which was in force for 16 months before being repealed by Act No. 1021 of 4 May 1962, was the pretext used to interfere with and finally dissolve all the employers' organisations.

Action is only taken (in accordance with the law and with due respect for human dignity) against counter-revolutionaries, murderers, arsonists, terrorists, saboteurs and mercenaries who invade our country at the order of the United States Government. Never have the workers enjoyed so much freedom to meet, to settle their own problems, to discuss them with members of the Government, to hold demonstrations and to take part in the management and organisation of production. Only a government with the widest support among the workers and the entire people would turn the barracks into schools, form a militia, give arms to the workers and peasants and call: the people together to discuss questions of all kinds in public. Only a government with the unqualified backing of the people could defeat in less than 72 hours a well-planned and powerful attack launched by the United States Central Intelligence Agency with 1,50 well-armed mercenaries who made a surprise landing in the Zapata Marshes.

The Committee followed this principle, for example, in Case No. 3 relating to the Dominican Republic"" and in Case No. 65 relating to Cuba-, when the previous Government was in power. Pursuing the same line of reasoning, the Committee, in Case No. 72 relating to Venezuela examined in May 1956, did not consider a complaint to be irreceivable because it relates to persons who no longer perform trade union duties as the result of a governmental measure dissolving the organisation to which they belonged and, in Case No. 143 relating to Spain 掳 examined in October 1957, did not consider a complaint irreceivable because former trade union leaders had set up a new organisation in a foreign country. The fact that their original organisation or a succeeding organisation has continued to exist in their own country, but under government control, has not been accepted by the Committee as a reason for refusing to entertain the complaint, although the question as to whether or not they were ousted from their old organisation by legitimate procedures is a factor which the Committee has had to consider when examining the complaint in substance.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898490, response status: 200"

These allegations may be summarised as follows. The regulations concerning trade union elections embodied in Decrees No. 65 of 20 January 1951 and No. 1559 of 19 June 1956 constituted an intervention by the State in a field in which the right of organisations to draw up necessary regulatory provisions is generally recognised ; these decrees, it was alleged, were contrary to the rights guaranteed to trade union organisations by Article 3 of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), namely the right to organise their activities and to elect their representatives in full freedom. Acts of violence were alleged to have been committed against trade unionists ; in particular, the complainants gave the names of several persons alleged to have been killed. It was alleged that the right of meeting was not respected and that a congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation took place under police supervision. Finally, allegations were formulated with respect to a wage freeze, the dismissal of workers and infringements of human rights.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its 137th Session (Geneva, October-November 1957). The Committee recommended the Governing Body to decide that the allegations relating to the wage freeze, dismissals and violation of human rights did not call for further examination. With respect to the allegations relating to the right of meeting, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to its view that police intervention on the occasion of a trade union congress is contrary to freedom of association and incompatible with Article 3 of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), which has been ratified by Cuba. With respect to the allegations relating to intervention by the State in trade union elections, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government of Cuba to its view that the electoral system introduced by Decrees No. 65 of 1951 and No. 1559 of 1956 is incompatible with the safeguards afforded to trade unions by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), which has been ratified by Cuba, and, in particular, with the provisions that "" workers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities "" and that "" the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof "", and to request the Government to take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with these provisions of the Convention. With respect to the allegations relating to wrongful acts committed against trade unionists, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government of Cuba, as a matter of urgency, to provide precise information on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the persons mentioned by name by the complainants, and, particularly, on the conclusions reached in the judicial investigations into these events, it being understood that the Committee would submit a further report on these allegations as soon as the information requested had been received.ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OBSERVATIONS","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

In the view of the Government nothing in the observations which it had presented on the allegations made by the complainants justified the conclusion that there had been any such admission on its part. Consequently, states the Government, this interpretation was erroneous and even malicious in the sense that it was calculated to distort the truth. The Government declares that in fact neither the police nor the security forces-even less so the army-entered the premises in which the trade union congress mentioned in the complaint of the Confederation of Workers of Latin America was being held, and surveillance was exercised only in the street for the exclusive purpose of preventing any possible disturbance.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

According to the Government, the decrees criticised in no way constitute instruments by which the trade unions are rendered subordinate. In support of this statement the Government declares that, moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has never regarded these texts as constituting an infringement of freedom of association. Finally, the Government states that these two decrees, which were promulgated in order to deal with a transitory situation, have since been repealed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

After inquiries had been opened by several examining magistrates on the ground of murder in the cases of Messrs. Alejo Tom谩s, H茅ctor Infante P茅rez, Isaac Hern谩ndez Oliver, Loynaz Hecheverria and Luis Sera Moreno, the courts before which these cases had been brought declared themselves to be incompetent and surrendered their jurisdiction to the military judicial authorities. With regard to the case of Mr. Armando Guzm谩n Guidi, the murder inquiry instituted by the competent examining tribunal was provisionally suspended pursuant to the second paragraph of section 641 of the Penal Code on the ground that it had not been possible to establish who were the authors of the crime, their accomplices or the persons who sheltered them. For the same reasons, proceedings were suspended in the cases of Messrs. Antonio Valencio Consuegro and Antonio Concepci贸n. Paradio. With regard to the case of Mr. Miguel Torres Su谩rez, whose death was verified through the files of the competent judicial authorities, an inquiry was opened by the said authorities and has not yet terminated. With regard, finally, to the cases of Messrs. Germ谩nico Mendoza, Ram贸n Concepci贸n Cue, Amaranto Fransua, Luis Frits, Miguel Mordago and Enrique Morgan, the Government declares that their names are not mentioned in the records of inquiries filed in December 1956.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

In reply to a specific allegation that such intervention had taken place the Government, without specifically admitting the intervention for which it was criticised in this particular instance, nevertheless did not deny this allegation but, on the contrary, admitted the principle of intervention by declaring that it regarded it as justifiable. The Government's observations in this connection were as follows : "" trade union activities, particularly in times of political disturbance, insurrection and terrorism, require the exercise of supervision by the police and the security forces."" In these circumstances the Committee took the view that the fact that the Government refrained from refuting the intervention for which it was criticised, added to the attitude which the Government adopted in favour of the principle of police supervision, was equivalent to an admission by the Government that such intervention had actually occurred.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

In support of this point of view, the Government declares that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has never regarded these texts as infringing freedom of association. It is true that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which has addressed to the Government of Cuba observations on certain points (trade union rights of officials and State, provincial and municipal employees, general prohibition of all political activities on the part of trade unions, presence of an official at trade union meetings), has not commented on the decrees in question. It is necessary, however, to point out that, if the Committee of Experts has not been able to make observations on the two decrees in question, this is to be explained by the fact that the decrees have never been mentioned by the Government in the reports which it has furnished, in accordance with article 22 of the Constitution of the I.L.O, on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98). Moreover, when the Committee of Experts, in 1956, specifically asked in one of its observations addressed to the Government of Cuba, whether there were "" provisions in the national legislation respecting the election of trade union leaders"", the Government, in its reply, made no reference to either of the texts criticised in the present case. Finally, when the draft monograph with respect to Cuba prepared in the course of the inquiry of the Committee on Freedom of Employers' and Workers' Organisations-a draft which also contained no reference to the two decrees in question-was communicated to the Government of Cuba for its observations and a request was made to the Government to indicate any texts which might be missing from the list of legislative texts annexed to the draft, the Government refrained from making any reference to the decrees in question. It is not possible, therefore, to interpret the absence of any observations on these texts by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations as having constituted even tacit approval of their contents.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

In fact, the Government states that the two decrees which were criticised have, since the 27th Report of the Committee was adopted, been repealed. In the concluding part of paragraph 380 (a) of the Committee's 27th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its 137th Session (October-November 1957), the Government was requested to take the necessary action to bring its legislation into harmony with the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87). In the repealing decree (Decree No. 3509), the text of which is annexed to the Government's communication dated 9 December 1957, and which, as the Government points out in its letter of 13 December 1957, was published in the Official Gazette of 10 December 1957, it is stated in one of the clauses of the preamble that one of the reasons justifying the repeal of the two decrees in question is to be found in the fact that they might be regarded as being at variance with the requirements of Convention No. 87. In these circumstances, the Committee notes with satisfaction the effect thus given by the Government of Cuba to one of its recommendations approved by the Governing Body.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898273, response status: 200"

Several trade union and democratic leaders, among whom were Mr. L谩zaro Pe帽a and the workers' leaders in the tobacco and transport industries, namely, Joaquin Ordoqui, Jorge Garcia Gallo, Gonzalo Collado, Carlos Fern谩ndez and Jos茅 Maria P茅rez, were thrown into prison. The premises of several trade unions and the residence of L谩zaro Pe帽a were ransacked by the police. The workers' daily newspaper Noticias de Hoy was banned. All Constitutional guarantees were suppressed on pretext of a plot which had no connection with the trade union or democratic movement. The real reason for these persecutions and repression is to be found in the intention of the Government to strike a blow against the unified struggle of the workers for their economic and social demands and for the maintenance of trade union and democratic freedom.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898110, response status: 200"
