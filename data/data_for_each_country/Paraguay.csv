The Government points out that most press workers are members of SITRAPREN, SPP and the Association of Graphic Reporters of Paraguay, which demonstrates that there is freedom of association and collective bargaining. The Government further emphasizes that collective bargaining and the content of a collective agreement on terms and conditions of employment are based on the wishes of the parties (employers and workers), in accordance with the provisions of Article聽4 of ILO Convention No. 98 and article 326 of the Labour Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4286000, response status: 200"

Noting that the allegation in question relates only to the alleged non-compliance with provisions adopted by the Executive to set minimum wages in a sector of activity and that it does not raise issues relating to freedom of association, the Committee will not proceed to examine these allegations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4286000, response status: 200"

Noting, moreover, that the Government refers to some examples of collective agreements on terms and conditions of employment between other trade union organizations and enterprises in the sector, and recalling that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements [see Compilation, paras 1313 and 1231], the Committee encourages the Government to do everything in its power to promote collective bargaining between the parties.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4286000, response status: 200"

In this respect, the Committee considers that a minimum of 20 members to form a union does not seem excessive in this case. The Committee also observes that, according to the supporting documentation supplied by the complainant organizations, the union maintained an ongoing correspondence with the competent authorities and rectified all the defects of form which had been pointed out. The Committee observes that in decision No. 257 the administrative authority rejected the union鈥檚 application for registration on the basis that the criterion for determining the number of union members at the company was not the number of members at the time of the constituent assembly but the number of members remaining in the union after the terminations of employment for various reasons. The Committee observes that over ten months elapsed between the date of establishment of the union (24 June 2015) and the date of the administrative authority鈥檚 decision concerning the definitive registration of the union (2聽May 2016). In this regard, the Committee recalls that a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 463].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950219, response status: 200"

The Committee recalls that especially at the initial stages of unionization in a workplace, dismissal of trade union representatives might fatally compromise incipient attempts at exercising the right to organize, as it not only deprives the workers of their representatives, but also has an intimidating effect on other workers who could have envisaged assuming trade union functions or simply joining the union [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 1131]. While noting with regret that neither the complainant organizations nor the Government have provided detailed information on the labour grievances submitted by the dismissed workers and the outcome thereof, the Committee recalls that where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 1159].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950219, response status: 200"

Lastly, in view of the seriousness of the allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination carried out in the days following the establishment of the union, the Committee recalls that in cases of the dismissal of trade unionists on the grounds of their trade union membership or activities, the Committee has requested the Government to take the necessary measures to enable trade union leaders and members who had been dismissed due to their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the enterprises concerned of the corresponding legal sanctions [see Compilation, op. cit., para.聽1167].

In this regard, the Committee notes the Government鈥檚 indications that: (i) with regard to labour matters, the binational entity is governed by the 鈥渓abour and social security protocol鈥?adopted in Paraguay through Act No. 606 of 19 November 1976 (the Committee has noted that, under section 4 of the protocol, the trade union rights of workers at the binational entity are determined by the laws of the country in which the workers are hired); and (ii) the issue of the adoption of the collective agreement on conditions of work was the subject of a labour court action brought by several employee unions at the binational entity, with the title Union of professional officials of the Yacyret谩 Binational Entity et al v Yacyret谩 Binational Entity re obligation to conclude collective agreement on conditions of work, and although in a ruling issued on 28聽October 2013, the First-Instance Civil and Labour Court (First Rota) of the Capital, Secretariat No. 1, accepted the complaint filed by the trade unions and ordered the enterprise to conclude and sign a collective agreement on conditions of work within 90 days, the Labour Appeals Court of the Capital (Second Chamber), in Judgment No. 83 of 26 August 2014, overturned the first-instance ruling.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3996580, response status: 200"

On that occasion, the Committee recalled that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers鈥?organizations and workers鈥?organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements, and it asked the Government to take the necessary steps to promote collective negotiation in good faith within the binational entity on conditions of work [see Case No. 3127, 386th Report, June 2018, paras 546鈥?51]. Furthermore, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, in 2014 the Appeals Court overturned a first-instance ruling which obliged the enterprise to conclude and sign a collective agreement on conditions of work within 90 days. The Committee notes that the Government has provided the text of the said rulings and observes that in its conclusions, the Appeals Court emphasized that at issue was not a collective agreement fully agreed by the parties and ready for signature, but rather a draft collective agreement which still needed to be examined and approved by the entity鈥檚 competent authorities. The Appeals Court also stressed that, as set out in the entity鈥檚 internal regulations, any decision that would create an obligation to the entity had to be taken by both directors and not only by one of them (in the present case only one of the two directors had been involved in the negotiation of the draft collective agreement). The Appeals Court concluded that the entity was therefore not obliged to sign the draft collective agreement and that the draft could only be binding to the entity after having been accepted and approved by it. The Committee takes due note of the said ruling and, recalling that it is following up this issue in Case No. 3127, invites the Government to examine, within the framework of the entity鈥檚 regulations, the conditions under which collective bargaining can be fully exercised.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3996580, response status: 200"

The Committee also observes that the complainants do not identify any particular worker who was supposedly dismissed as a result of the strike. Although the complainants attached a letter dated 2 March 2015 signed by the legal adviser of the binational entity indicating that the dismissal of Mr Alberto Andr茅s Bernal Ru铆z was due to policies implemented by the binational entity as part of a human resources optimization programme, there is no indication in this letter or in any other attached document of the date when the worker was dismissed or whether the dismissal was due to his trade union activities or his participation in the strike. Nor do the complainants indicate whether any judicial appeal was made against the dismissal.

On this point, the Committee recalls that in Case No. 3019, it examined specific allegations on the way in which section 292 of the Labour Code may undermine the rights of public sector workers鈥?organizations and noted that requiring 20 per cent of workers to be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to 500 employees could result in a requirement of up to 100聽workers to establish a trade union and that this could, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish organizations of their own choosing.

In that connection, the Committee recalls that the publication and distribution of news and information of general or special interest to trade unions and their members constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures designed to control publication and means of information may involve serious interference by administrative authorities with this activity. The Committee recalls that the 1970 International Labour Conference resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties places special emphasis on the civil liberties essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression and, in particular, the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media.

In its opinion, the binational entity used this instrument to launch a campaign of dismissals, thereby causing a serious labour dispute within the entity. The CUT adds that the union members expressed the wish to talk to the director of the entity on several occasions but the latter refused to see the workers. Furthermore, the CUT indicates that the new regulations do not recognize the Paraguayan Labour Code and do not safeguard seniority or trade union immunity.

The CUT indicates that the dismissals included those of 40 SEMEBY members. According to the complainant, the dismissals were unjustified and evidently stemmed from discrimination of a partisan and ideological nature. In its opinion, the measure is part of the downsizing of government structures by the current national executive, involving the dismissal of persons branded as 鈥渓eftists鈥?purely for having gained entry under the last national executive, in 2008. The CUT indicates that since this was a case of mass dismissals, authorization should have been sought from the labour administrative authority, but this did not happen. The complainant adds that Argentine law, which applies at the binational entity, prohibits mass dismissals except for reasons of force majeure.

The complainant organizations allege that: (i) under Executive Decree No. 19260/61, various labour jurisdictions were granted to the trade unions of LOMP; (ii) in the port of Caacupe-m铆, the San Francisco SA enterprise outsourced its dock work to evade the legal requirements, using subcontracting and to that end establishing the affiliated company Jerovi谩 Servicios聽SA; (iii)聽private port enterprises, and in particular San Francisco SA and its affiliated company Jerovi谩 Servicios SA, violate Act No. 1248/36 by hiring workers who are not members of the trade unions authorized for the respective jurisdiction; and (iv) the Prefecture-General for Shipping and the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping, at the instigation of the association of port managers, issue work permits to dockworkers who do not meet the requirements of Act No. 1248/36. In view of this situation, LOMP filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, requesting an inspection to determine whether the dockworkers who are hired comply with the legal requirements relating to authorization and whether they are members of the trade unions authorized to provide access to recruitment (LOMP indicates that the Human Rights Committee of the Senate requested a report from the Prefecture-General for Shipping in a note dated 17 December 2014). Accordingly, on 23 December an inspection report was published, which indicated that three attempts had been necessary before the inspection could be carried out and that it had found that the dockworkers concerned were not employed by either San Francisco SA or by the subcontractor Jerovi谩 Servicios SA and other employees of the latter enterprise were working there at the time. The complainants consider that the inspection report and the enterprise鈥檚 actions provide evidence that it has committed violations: the inspection report found, firstly, that the workers were not members of any of the trade unions authorized to supply the necessary staff, in violation of article 66 of Act No.聽1248/36 and, secondly, that in a tripartite meeting held on 27 November 2014 with representatives of LOMP, the representatives of San Francisco SA claimed the right to hire workers of their choosing. The complainants conclude that, by allowing the enterprise to choose its dockworkers and the fact that the Prefecture-General for Shipping authorizes this, the State is violating the legal provisions in force.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

The complainants report that, although in the past the public authorities, including the judiciary, had recognized the applicability of these collective agreements and the jurisdiction of the trade unions, in recent years there has been a failure to apply the provisions contained in the agreements concerning the role of the trade unions in the selection of workers. In particular, they allege that the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, through the Prefecture-General for Shipping, allow and even encourage non-compliance with the collective agreement between ASAMAR and SAPAC and that the Supreme Court of Justice revoked the aforementioned collective agreement by Ruling No. 1325 of 7 September 2006 (not allowing the participation of the trade unions in the judicial proceedings 鈥?a matter which was the subject of another allegation).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

The complainants indicate that eight to ten canoes took up positions on the Paraguay River as a symbolic act of protest, while a demonstration was being held on land opposite the Caacupe-m铆 port. The complainants indicate that these flimsy canoes did not constitute any obstacle for vessels of any size moving along the Paraguay River; in fact, when the launch from the Prefecture-General for Shipping passed by, the wash was strong enough to overturn one of the canoes. The complainants indicate that, in response to an action filed by the enterprise, the Criminal Judge of Guarantees No. 8 of the capital issued an emergency preventive measure, under a ruling of 15 December of 2014, ordering the workers to refrain from obstructing freedom of movement on the Paraguay River and from preventing the entry and exit of vehicles and persons to and from the port premises, whereupon the Prefecture-General for Shipping intervened to arrest the workers who were protesting. The complainants consider that, under this preventive measure, a decision was taken on the substance of the matter without requiring the claimant to pay the bond for costs, as provided for by law. The complainants add that, as a result of the complaint filed by the enterprise, an order was given for the detention of 11 workers 鈥?whose names are listed in the complaint by LOMP 鈥?who were placed in preventive detention on the basis of article 214 of the Criminal Code of Paraguay (concerning dangerous interference in shipping) and are facing a six-year prison sentence. The complainants add that, following an appeal against the preventive detention measure, the 11 workers were put under house arrest, which still prevents them from working or supporting their families. The complainants consider that the preventive measures violate freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

The complainants refer to three rulings in particular:(i) Ruling No. 1812 of 20 December 2004 concerning a claim for the payment of wages to SEMA members, brought against a shipping enterprise domiciled outside Paraguay that occasionally employed a national enterprise to manage unloading and other services. In this ruling, the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the 鈥渓aw does not authorize trade unions to represent their members vis-脿-vis the judicial authorities without an express mandate鈥?and that 鈥渢he ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, but it is currently the legal provision in force, whereby the law does not confer direct procedural competence on the trade unions to represent their members before the courts, requiring the maximum authority of the trade union 鈥?the assembly 鈥?to grant an express mandate to bring legal actions鈥?and that the trade union did not provide any kind of instrument conferring such authorization. The complainants allege, however, that the court had received the minutes of SEMA鈥檚 general assembly, which were incorporated into a valid public instrument (pp. 29鈥?3), and this shows that the assembly decided to file an appeal but that the Court had not seen the document. The complainants allege that, as a result of this ruling, the payment of money owed to the workers was prevented;(ii) Ruling No. 1325 of 7 November 2006, referred to above, declaring articles 9 and 29 of the collective agreement 鈥?which had previously recognized the trade unions鈥?right to nominate workers for recruitment 鈥?to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it could undermine possible pay increases for non-unionized workers. According to the complainant organizations, although the assembly鈥檚 minutes conferring an express mandate had been submitted under aforementioned Ruling No. 1812, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the trade union concerned (SAPAC) was not authorized to file a claim for the payment of wages (accrued prior to the declaration of unconstitutionality) and that each individual union member should file his own claim, which, according to the complainants, was impossible as a claim could only be filed for the total amount that was alleged to be unpaid; and(iii) Ruling No. 1449 of 15 October 2012 regarding the claim for reimbursement of US$126聽million to workers who had contributed to the defunct National Workers鈥?Bank. The Court, while again recognizing that the ensuing deregulation could be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, rejected the claim on the basis of the doctrine underlying aforementioned Ruling No. 1812, finding that the trade unions did not have an express mandate from their members to bring the legal action or the necessary legal capacity (in this regard, the complainant organizations claim that the trade unions had submitted the requisite powers of attorney to file the claim). The complainants add that, as a result of this decision, the money owed was never reimbursed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

On the other hand, the Committee observes that the enterprise in question alleges that it is the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) which is violating freedom of association by seeking to impose the selection of workers, exclude the possibility of hiring workers that are not members of its trade unions, and curtail the freedom of association of non-unionized workers. In that regard, the Committee wishes to recall that a distinction should be made between union security clauses allowed by law and those imposed by law, only the latter of which appear to result in a trade union monopoly system contrary to the principles of freedom of association; that problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country; and that both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where they are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, paras 363 and 365]. The Committee recalls that union security clauses should be agreed freely and observes that the complaints contain no elements to show that the enterprises concerned have agreed to a union security clause; on the contrary, the observations provided show their opposition to any such clause.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee observes that, although the complainant organizations refer to the subcontractor as the dockworkers鈥?employer, the enterprise that manages the port indicates that the legal relationship was based on service contracts between the subcontractor and the trade unions, which were the employers. The Committee observes that an inspection was conducted to monitor the enterprise鈥檚 compliance with the labour regulations and, in particular, to investigate the allegations of anti-union dismissals, but that the inspection did not find any violation and found that the workers that claimed a violation of their rights were members of the trade unions of maritime dockworkers and were not employed by the enterprise against which the complaint had been filed. Moreover, the Committee observes that the enterprise indicates that: (i) since the employment relationship was based on service contracts with the trade unions, there was no possibility of collective bargaining on account of the legal obstacle arising from the fact that the workers were employed by the trade union; (ii) no dismissals were carried out, but rather the service contracts with the trade unions were terminated on the grounds of serious non-compliance by the unions (the enterprise includes in this the blockade of the Paraguay River, which reportedly took place after the dismissals); (iii) the enterprise indicated that it was open to hiring the dockworkers who had lost their jobs; and (iv) the enterprise claims that it does not exclude workers who are trade union members from recruitment, but that it is opposed to the imposition of the recruitment of trade union members only. In these circumstances, the Committee does not have the necessary information to conclude that the issues raised involve acts of anti-union discrimination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

According to the complainant organizations, this action did not obstruct the passage of any vessel but resulted in the prosecution of 11 workers, who remain under house arrest. The Committee observes that the Government, for its part, alleges that: (i) the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, whereupon a judge ordered the end of the blockade at all points on the Paraguay River; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the order, whereupon they were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor鈥檚 Office, and article 214 of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides for imprisonment of up to six years for any person who creates an obstacle that threatens the safety of shipping.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

In that regard, the Committee wishes to refer to the following principles: that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests; that preventive detention should be limited to very short periods of time intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry; that workers should enjoy prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences; and that the authorities should not resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of or participation in a peaceful strike, since such measures entail serious risks of abuse and constitute a grave threat to freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., paras 133, 78, 109 and 671].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the complainants refer to three rulings by the Supreme Court of Justice, denying the unions the possibility of representation on the grounds that no express mandate had been given by the trade union鈥檚 assembly (the complainants claim, however, that in at least two of the three cases they had submitted the assembly minutes conferring an express mandate). The Committee also observes that, although the Government does not go into the substance of the issue and merely recognizes the existence of the rulings in question, the Supreme Court of Justice itself, while considering an express mandate to be legally necessary, found in two of the rulings that 鈥渢he ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union鈥? In this regard, the Committee considers that neither the legislation nor the application thereof should limit the right of employers鈥?and workers鈥?organizations to represent their members, including in cases of individual labour complaints. The Committee invites the Government to examine, in consultation with the social partners, the adequacy of the legislation and of the application thereof in order to ensure that employers鈥?and workers鈥?organizations are able to exercise the right to represent their members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282140, response status: 200"

The complainant organizations allege that: (i) under Executive Decree No. 19260/61, various labour jurisdictions were granted to the trade unions of LOMP; (ii) in the port of Caacupe-m铆, the San Francisco SA enterprise outsourced its dock work to evade the legal requirements, using subcontracting and to that end establishing the affiliated company Jerovi谩 Servicios聽SA; (iii)聽private port enterprises, and in particular San Francisco SA and its affiliated company Jerovi谩 Servicios SA, violate Act No. 1248/36 by hiring workers who are not members of the trade unions authorized for the respective jurisdiction; and (iv) the Prefecture-General for Shipping and the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping, at the instigation of the association of port managers, issue work permits to dockworkers who do not meet the requirements of Act No. 1248/36. In view of this situation, LOMP filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, requesting an inspection to determine whether the dockworkers who are hired comply with the legal requirements relating to authorization and whether they are members of the trade unions authorized to provide access to recruitment (LOMP indicates that the Human Rights Committee of the Senate requested a report from the Prefecture-General for Shipping in a note dated 17 December 2014). Accordingly, on 23 December an inspection report was published, which indicated that three attempts had been necessary before the inspection could be carried out and that it had found that the dockworkers concerned were not employed by either San Francisco SA or by the subcontractor Jerovi谩 Servicios SA and other employees of the latter enterprise were working there at the time. The complainants consider that the inspection report and the enterprise鈥檚 actions provide evidence that it has committed violations: the inspection report found, firstly, that the workers were not members of any of the trade unions authorized to supply the necessary staff, in violation of article 66 of Act No.聽1248/36 and, secondly, that in a tripartite meeting held on 27 November 2014 with representatives of LOMP, the representatives of San Francisco SA claimed the right to hire workers of their choosing. The complainants conclude that, by allowing the enterprise to choose its dockworkers and the fact that the Prefecture-General for Shipping authorizes this, the State is violating the legal provisions in force.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

The complainants report that, although in the past the public authorities, including the judiciary, had recognized the applicability of these collective agreements and the jurisdiction of the trade unions, in recent years there has been a failure to apply the provisions contained in the agreements concerning the role of the trade unions in the selection of workers. In particular, they allege that the Directorate-General for National Merchant Shipping and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, through the Prefecture-General for Shipping, allow and even encourage non-compliance with the collective agreement between ASAMAR and SAPAC and that the Supreme Court of Justice revoked the aforementioned collective agreement by Ruling No. 1325 of 7 September 2006 (not allowing the participation of the trade unions in the judicial proceedings 鈥?a matter which was the subject of another allegation).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

The complainants indicate that eight to ten canoes took up positions on the Paraguay River as a symbolic act of protest, while a demonstration was being held on land opposite the Caacupe-m铆 port. The complainants indicate that these flimsy canoes did not constitute any obstacle for vessels of any size moving along the Paraguay River; in fact, when the launch from the Prefecture-General for Shipping passed by, the wash was strong enough to overturn one of the canoes. The complainants indicate that, in response to an action filed by the enterprise, the Criminal Judge of Guarantees No. 8 of the capital issued an emergency preventive measure, under a ruling of 15 December of 2014, ordering the workers to refrain from obstructing freedom of movement on the Paraguay River and from preventing the entry and exit of vehicles and persons to and from the port premises, whereupon the Prefecture-General for Shipping intervened to arrest the workers who were protesting. The complainants consider that, under this preventive measure, a decision was taken on the substance of the matter without requiring the claimant to pay the bond for costs, as provided for by law.

In this ruling, the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that the 鈥渓aw does not authorize trade unions to represent their members vis-脿-vis the judicial authorities without an express mandate鈥?and that 鈥渢he ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, but it is currently the legal provision in force, whereby the law does not confer direct procedural competence on the trade unions to represent their members before the courts, requiring the maximum authority of the trade union 鈥?the assembly 鈥?to grant an express mandate to bring legal actions鈥?and that the trade union did not provide any kind of instrument conferring such authorization. The complainants allege, however, that the court had received the minutes of SEMA鈥檚 general assembly, which were incorporated into a valid public instrument (pp. 29鈥?3), and this shows that the assembly decided to file an appeal but that the Court had not seen the document. The complainants allege that, as a result of this ruling, the payment of money owed to the workers was prevented;(ii) Ruling No. 1325 of 7 November 2006, referred to above, declaring articles 9 and 29 of the collective agreement 鈥?which had previously recognized the trade unions鈥?right to nominate workers for recruitment 鈥?to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it could undermine possible pay increases for non-unionized workers. According to the complainant organizations, although the assembly鈥檚 minutes conferring an express mandate had been submitted under aforementioned Ruling No. 1812, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the trade union concerned (SAPAC) was not authorized to file a claim for the payment of wages (accrued prior to the declaration of unconstitutionality) and that each individual union member should file his own claim, which, according to the complainants, was impossible as a claim could only be filed for the total amount that was alleged to be unpaid; and(iii) Ruling No. 1449 of 15 October 2012 regarding the claim for reimbursement of US$126聽million to workers who had contributed to the defunct National Workers鈥?Bank. The Court, while again recognizing that the ensuing deregulation could be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, rejected the claim on the basis of the doctrine underlying aforementioned Ruling No. 1812, finding that the trade unions did not have an express mandate from their members to bring the legal action or the necessary legal capacity (in this regard, the complainant organizations claim that the trade unions had submitted the requisite powers of attorney to file the claim). The complainants add that, as a result of this decision, the money owed was never reimbursed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

When the enterprise representative failed to attend the second meeting, the workers鈥?representatives requested a general inspection, which resulted in an inspection order dated 6聽October 2014 to review the employment situation of the dockworkers concerned and the employer鈥檚 compliance with the regulations. At the first two attempts, the inspectors were unable to conduct the inspection owing to the refusal of the enterprise鈥檚 legal adviser, who claimed that the inspectors could only enter the premises to conduct the inspection if they had a court order. The inspection was carried out at the third attempt, on 10 October 2014. The Government indicates that the inspection found that the workers alleging the violation of their rights were members of the trade union organizations of maritime dockworkers but that they were not employees of the enterprise in question.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

Accordingly, the Government indicates that article 214 of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides that any person who creates an obstacle endangering the safety of air or rail transport or shipping shall be liable to imprisonment of up to six years.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

Case No 3110 (Paraguay),17-Dec-14,World Federation of Trade Unions (FSM) ,['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125'],"621.The Committee observes that one of the central issues raised in the complaints concerns the allegation that, under certain items of legislation and collective agreements, it is the prerogative of the trade unions authorized in each jurisdiction to nominate dockworkers to carry out work in the ports concerned (the complainant organizations report that both the enterprise and the public authorities have violated this trade union prerogative). On the other hand, the Committee observes that the enterprise in question alleges that it is the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) which is violating freedom of association by seeking to impose the selection of workers, exclude the possibility of hiring workers that are not members of its trade unions, and curtail the freedom of association of non-unionized workers. In that regard, the Committee wishes to recall that a distinction should be made between union security clauses allowed by law and those imposed by law, only the latter of which appear to result in a trade union monopoly system contrary to the principles of freedom of association; that problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country; and that both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where they are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, paras 363 and 365]. The Committee recalls that union security clauses should be agreed freely and observes that the complaints contain no elements to show that the enterprises concerned have agreed to a union security clause; on the contrary, the observations provided show their opposition to any such clause.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee observes that, although the complainant organizations refer to the subcontractor as the dockworkers鈥?employer, the enterprise that manages the port indicates that the legal relationship was based on service contracts between the subcontractor and the trade unions, which were the employers. The Committee observes that an inspection was conducted to monitor the enterprise鈥檚 compliance with the labour regulations and, in particular, to investigate the allegations of anti-union dismissals, but that the inspection did not find any violation and found that the workers that claimed a violation of their rights were members of the trade unions of maritime dockworkers and were not employed by the enterprise against which the complaint had been filed. Moreover, the Committee observes that the enterprise indicates that: (i) since the employment relationship was based on service contracts with the trade unions, there was no possibility of collective bargaining on account of the legal obstacle arising from the fact that the workers were employed by the trade union; (ii) no dismissals were carried out, but rather the service contracts with the trade unions were terminated on the grounds of serious non-compliance by the unions (the enterprise includes in this the blockade of the Paraguay River, which reportedly took place after the dismissals); (iii) the enterprise indicated that it was open to hiring the dockworkers who had lost their jobs; and (iv) the enterprise claims that it does not exclude workers who are trade union members from recruitment, but that it is opposed to the imposition of the recruitment of trade union members only. In these circumstances, the Committee does not have the necessary information to conclude that the issues raised involve acts of anti-union discrimination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

According to the complainant organizations, this action did not obstruct the passage of any vessel but resulted in the prosecution of 11 workers, who remain under house arrest. The Committee observes that the Government, for its part, alleges that: (i) the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, whereupon a judge ordered the end of the blockade at all points on the Paraguay River; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the order, whereupon they were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor鈥檚 Office, and article 214 of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides for imprisonment of up to six years for any person who creates an obstacle that threatens the safety of shipping.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

In that regard, the Committee wishes to refer to the following principles: that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests; that preventive detention should be limited to very short periods of time intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry; that workers should enjoy prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences; and that the authorities should not resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of or participation in a peaceful strike, since such measures entail serious risks of abuse and constitute a grave threat to freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., paras 133, 78, 109 and 671].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the complainants refer to three rulings by the Supreme Court of Justice, denying the unions the possibility of representation on the grounds that no express mandate had been given by the trade union鈥檚 assembly (the complainants claim, however, that in at least two of the three cases they had submitted the assembly minutes conferring an express mandate). The Committee also observes that, although the Government does not go into the substance of the issue and merely recognizes the existence of the rulings in question, the Supreme Court of Justice itself, while considering an express mandate to be legally necessary, found in two of the rulings that 鈥渢he ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union鈥? In this regard, the Committee considers that neither the legislation nor the application thereof should limit the right of employers鈥?and workers鈥?organizations to represent their members, including in cases of individual labour complaints. The Committee invites the Government to examine, in consultation with the social partners, the adequacy of the legislation and of the application thereof in order to ensure that employers鈥?and workers鈥?organizations are able to exercise the right to represent their members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3282125, response status: 200"

As more than a year had passed, the action was time-barred but the Labour Court ruled in favour of the application and declared the strike illegal. An appeal was lodged against this ruling, and in a ruling of 15 December 2015 the Labour Appeal Court of the City of Asunci贸n declared the invalidity of the proceedings. The application by the Attorney-General鈥檚 Office demonstrates the Government鈥檚 policy of anti-union intimidation and harassment. Furthermore, after the strike, deductions were made from the strikers鈥?wages, even though the UNE鈥揝N had offered at the tripartite round table to make up the days in return for the non-deduction of wages 鈥?a possibility that is provided for under section 373 of the Labour Code.(ii)	As a result of the strike, it was agreed that a tripartite round table would be set up with the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) to discuss the adoption of a collective agreement on working conditions in the sector. Although working sessions were held in October, November and December 2014 and in January 2015, since March 2015 all work has been suspended without any explanation, which demonstrates the reluctance on the part of the authorities to reach a collective agreement. Furthermore, the UNE鈥揝N alleges that, in 2015, no progress was made in respect of effective communication and joint work between the unions and the MEC. For instance, it points out that the Minister did not agree to hold any meetings with union officials in a year and that she issued decisions on matters affecting the education system and relating to competitive examinations without prior consultation.(iii)	In general, the UNE鈥揝N alleges anti-union harassment through repressive measures, which is demonstrated through accusations and sanctions against officials. In particular, it alleges that, at the end of 2015, many trade union officials from other organizations were dismissed, most of whom had more than 23 years of service, mentioning in particular Ms聽Blanca Avalos (general secretary of the Organization of Education Workers of Paraguay鈥揘ational Trade Union (OTEP-SN)); Mr Marcos Gonz谩lez (general secretary of the Federation of Educators of Paraguay (FEP)); Mr Atilano Fleitas (FEP vice-president); Mr Carlos Parodi (FEP official); and Mr Javier Ben铆tez (FEP official).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950189, response status: 200"

Regarding the granting of trade union leave, the Government indicates that: (i) trade union leave is recognized in the Teachers鈥?Statute, section 38 of which provides that in no case may trade union leave be granted to teachers who have been registered for less than five years; and (ii) Resolution No. 92726 of 13 June 2014, which is being challenged by the complainant organization and which governs the granting of trade union leave, was issued in accordance with the national legal framework.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950189, response status: 200"

While the Government states that in practice workers can belong to more than one trade union if these are from different institutions, the Committee recalls that the complaint concerned the non-deduction of trade union dues, through Decision No. 84 of 30聽March 2015 of the Legal Advisory Service of the Ministry of Education and Culture, due to the illegality of workers being members of multiple unions. The Committee also notes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has made the same observation in the context of the examination of the application by Paraguay of Convention No. 87. The Committee further notes that the restrictions on the granting of trade union leave alleged by the complainant organization, in particular the requirement that teachers must have been registered for five years, are also based on legislative provisions (section 38 of the Teachers鈥?Statute). The Committee wishes to recall in this regard, as it did in its previous examination of the case, that establishing that teachers must have been registered for five years in order to obtain trade union leave raises problems of conformity with the principles of freedom of association. With regard to the apparent restrictions on multiple membership established in section 293(c) of the Labour Code, which apparently had an impact on the retention of union dues, and the requirements for the granting of trade union leave, in particular the requirement that teachers must have been registered for five years, the Committee again requests the Government to initiate social dialogue with the most representative organizations affected with a view to finding, including by making any amendments to the aforementioned laws that may be necessary, satisfactory solutions in terms of trade union leave and the deduction of trade union dues, in the light of the abovementioned principles of freedom of association. The Committee refers this legislative aspect of the case to the CEACR.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950189, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee recalls that the education sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term, although minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strike of long duration [see Compilation, op. cit., paras 842 and 898]. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the appeal against the ruling by the Labour Appeal Court (which invalidated the proceedings concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike) and requests that, through social dialogue, it take the measures that are necessary to ensure full respect for the abovementioned principles of freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3950189, response status: 200"

Regarding the dismissals for participation in 2013 in a teachers鈥?strike that was declared illegal, the Committee refers to the abovementioned principles on strikes in the education sector and recalls that no one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out a legitimate strike [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 953]. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with these principles, including the compensation and reinstatement of the officials who were dismissed for participating in a teachers鈥?strike, and to keep it informed in this regard.

The Government emphasizes in this respect that the collective agreement is something that is wanted and being promoted by the MEC, and states that since 2014 it has been working with the unions, especially with the UNE鈥揝N, on projects aimed at entering into a collective agreement, and that the adoption of such an agreement will represent a milestone for labour relations in the country. The Government reports that the support of the ILO has been requested for these efforts. The Government also denies the allegations that there has been a lack of progress in effective communication and joint work, and the allegations of anti-union harassment. In this regard, the Government provides detailed information on the implementation of initiatives and activities that demonstrate the joint work that is being carried out by the MEC and the trade unions, including vocational and trade union training programmes organized jointly with the trade unions (and delivered to more than 30,000 teachers per month in 2015 and 2016), as well as the creation of institutional round tables with the different trade union organizations to discuss issues of common interest such as salary adjustment or the teaching and administrative career. To sum up, regarding the allegations of denial of social dialogue and collective bargaining, while noting that the complainant organization alleges that since March 2015 and for the rest of that year there was no progress in collective bargaining or in effective communication or joint work, the Committee notes that the Government emphasizes its commitment to enter into a collective agreement 鈥?indicating that the ILO has been asked for support in this respect 鈥?and describes in detail various joint initiatives and activities carried out with the trade unions in 2015 and 2016. The Committee encourages the authorities concerned to continue to promote social dialogue with the representative trade unions in the MEC, in particular with the complainant organization, and trusts that, in the very near future, a collective agreement on working conditions will be signed, and that any of the issues raised in this case that may still be pending can be addressed through this agreement.

The UNE鈥揝N considers that the Resolution undermines the principles of freedom of association and the possibility of performing trade union duties: (i) by granting leave only to teachers who have been registered for five years (Article 2), thus contradicting the provisions of the Labour Code which establish that the status of trade union officials is subject solely to the decisions made at trade union meetings and to trade union regulations; and (ii) by establishing that leave is granted 鈥渨ithout prejudice to the duties performed鈥?(Article 3), which, according to the UNE鈥揝N, allows the employer or higher authority full discretion to grant leave. The UNE鈥揝N also alleges that Circular No. 7/14 of the Ministry of Education and Culture required workers who were on trade union leave when Resolution No. 9726 was enacted to return to their posts at the corresponding educational institutions, and established that workers who did not comply with the orders would be subjected to administrative proceedings for dereliction of duty. Consequently, the majority of the UNE鈥揝N leaders who had been granted union leave returned to their workplaces and two officials (Mr Julio Rafael Ben铆tez Gonz谩lez and Mr Juan Carlos Vera S谩nchez) were subjected to administrative proceedings, which the UNE鈥揝N considers is proof of the persecution of trade union officials. As a result of Resolution No. 9726, the UNE鈥揝N believes that its organization does not have access to paid trade union leave, which is the only support for trade union organizations provided by the State. The UNE鈥揝N furthermore states that Resolution No. 9726 violated agreements on the granting of leave which had been adopted since 1993 between the Ministry and trade unions, in addition to various ministerial resolutions through which leave had been granted since that time. The UNE鈥揝N adds that, although the most recent leave granted was to expire on 31 December 2013, it had been agreed that this leave would remain in effect until a consensus had been reached, which did not happen as the Ministry adopted Resolution No. 9726 instead.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254269, response status: 200"

According to the enterprise, the workers whose employment was terminated established a trade union immediately after being relieved of their posts and the request for registration of the union was refused by the administrative labour authorities because it did not meet the minimum number of members required under section 292 of the Labour Code (20 members to establish an enterprise-level union).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3327359, response status: 200"

The Committee recalls that in this case it examined specific allegations on the way in which section 292 of the Labour Code undermines the rights of public sector workers鈥?organizations and noted that a requirement that 20 per cent of workers be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to 500 employees could result in a requirement of up to 100 workers to establish a trade union, and that this could, in effect, undermine public sector workers鈥?rights to establish organizations of their own choosing.

The Committee notes that the documents provided by the Government reveal that 20 members of the union gave up their membership of their own free will on 21 and 22 June 2011, which is to say a few days before the union requested its registration from the General Labour Directorate.

The Committee, while noting the enterprise鈥檚 observations, recalls that, taking account of the general nature of the allegations of anti-union discrimination raised, it had invited the complainants to provide additional information so that it may examine those and other allegations of anti-union dismissals and discrimination in greater detail, and to seek the relevant additional observations from the Government.

The Committee also notes that the Government underlines that an online system for registering and updating data has been established enabling the trade unions to follow up cases and manage documents, thereby minimizing red tape. Recalling that for many years the CEACR has been observing the need to strengthen the legal provisions against anti-union discrimination and that this Committee has in the past requested the Government 鈥渋n consultation with the social partners, to ensure effective national procedures for the prevention and sanctioning of anti-union discrimination鈥?[see Case No. 2648, 355th Report, para. 963], the Committee requests the Government to inform the CEACR, to which the legislative aspects of the case are referred, of the consultations held with the social partners to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3327359, response status: 200"

The Government emphasizes that, as shown in the complaints, police statement and arrest warrant of 24 April 2012, the arrests were ordered for the alleged commission of crimes against safe cohabitation of people and for disturbance of the public peace, which have no bearing on trade union affairs.

The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, one of its priorities is to modernize the labour inspectorate and increase the effectiveness of inspection procedures and that in 2015, 30 new labour inspectors were recruited who were trained in areas relating to the Conventions ratified by the country.

In this respect, the Committee has considered that the exercise of financial powers by the public authorities in a manner that prevents or limits compliance with collective agreements already entered into by public bodies is not consistent with the principle of free collective bargaining [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, para. 1034]. The Committee also recalls that, with regard to the requirement that draft collective agreements in the public sector must be accompanied by a preliminary opinion on their financial implications issued by the financial authorities, and not by the public body or enterprise concerned, the Committee noted that it was aware that collective bargaining in the public sector called for verification of the available resources in the various public bodies or undertakings, that such resources were dependent on state budgets and that the period of duration of collective agreements in the public sector did not always coincide with the duration of the State Budgetary Law 鈥?a situation which could give rise to difficulties. The body issuing the above opinion could also formulate recommendations in line with government economic policy or seek to ensure that the collective bargaining process did not give rise to any discrimination in the working conditions of the employees in different public institutions or undertakings. Provision should therefore be made for a mechanism which ensured that, in the collective bargaining process in the public sector, both trade union organizations and the employers and their associations were consulted and could express their points of view to the authority responsible or assessing the financial consequences of draft collective agreements. Nevertheless, notwithstanding any opinion submitted by the financial authorities, the parties to collective bargaining should be able to conclude an agreement freely [see Digest, op. cit., para. 1037]. The Committee invites the Government to examine this matter of collective agreements in the public sector with the social partners concerned in the light of the aforementioned principles.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3327359, response status: 200"

In the case of SITRAPAN, the owner of the enterprise submitted an objection to the provisional registration on the grounds that no employer鈥揺mployee relationship existed. The trade union was founded on 14 January 2011 but, as a result of a public tendering process, all of the workers were on fixed-term contracts, which had ended on 31 November 2010. The labour administration had notified the applicants of the objection but had not received any reply from them. Consequently, it decided not to approve the final registration of the trade union. In the case of SINFAPAVI, the enterprise objected that there had been irregularities in the establishment of the union. Having received no reply from the union, the labour administration considered that the legal requirements for the establishment of the union had not been fulfilled. In the case of SITRASALIM, the Government notes that the objections to its final registration were submitted not by the management, but by another trade union of the same institution, the Union of Workers of the District Hospital of Limpio (SITRALIMP), which alleged that documents had been submitted out of time and that some members were ineligible to join the union because they were civil servants who held positions of trust. Although the labour administration considered that SITRALIMP鈥檚 objections could not form the basis of a challenge, it rejected the final registration of the union on the grounds that SITRASALIM did not comply with the legal requirements because: the articles of incorporation did not state the names of the founding members; the required minimum 20 per cent founding members in a public sector union in institutions of up to 500 employees was not met (only 18 persons of a total of 417 civil servants were recorded as having attended); and the documents submitted were wholly unclear as to the name of the union and used various formulations and acronyms. In the case of SINTREMAE, the MAEHARA enterprise objected that the union did not have the minimum number of members required by article聽292 of the Labour Code (20 members for enterprise trade unions). The labour administration had notified the applicant trade union of the objection and, as it had not received a reply, it considered that final registration should not be granted. The union鈥檚 appeal was denied, as the administration鈥檚 decision was final.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254203, response status: 200"

The Government transmits the information provided by the competent administrative authorities in relation to the cases and indicates the meetings and mediation attempts that have taken place. It appears from the documentation provided that an agreement was reached on two individual complaints made against the MAEHARA enterprise, with the offer of payment of accrued wages and of welfare benefits for unfair dismissal sought by the workers concerned. In most of the other cases reviewed by the administrative authorities, the meetings did not result in the resolution of the complaints. The Government also transmits information provided by some of the enterprises concerned. The Grupo La Victoria enterprise states that the reduction in workers as a result of shortages of raw materials had been communicated to the regional labour directorate and that at no point were trade unionists dismissed, given that the four workers who were dismissed were not unionized at the time and only joined the union after the fact. As to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the SAS, the SAS states that the workers were not dismissed; instead, it had been decided that the contracts of a large number of workers would not be renewed and those affected received notice in accordance with the contract. The SAS also states that the majority of those workers were rehired, in particular the union leaders who enjoyed trade union immunity, and their status was applied. The SAS considers that the labour dispute was resolved as a result. With regard to the PROSEGUR enterprise, the Government states that the enterprise signed a collective agreement that was approved and registered by decision of 10 December 2012, and that the alleged dismissal was the subject of legal proceedings and is before the Committee under Case No. 3010.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254203, response status: 200"

The Government states that the police asked them to go with them to the police station, where they were informed of their detention order in compliance with all legal safeguards, including communication with their lawyers. They were subsequently transferred to another police station, where they continued to communicate freely and were under the responsibility of the Public Prosecutor鈥檚 Office.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254203, response status: 200"

The SAECA regional bank, which had a collective agreement that was approved and registered in 2006, negotiated a new collective agreement that was approved and registered by an administrative resolution of 5 January 2012. The ESSO enterprise indicates in a communication dated 26 September 2012 that it has always shown complete willing to engage in negotiations, that there has never been any obstacles to negotiating a collective agreement with the union and that consensus was reached on a preliminary collective agreement on 20 September 2012. The refrigeration enterprise IPFSA states that it has not reviewed the draft collective agreement submitted by the union because it has, for several years, had fewer than 20 employees (with only 11 at the present time) and consequently does not meet the conditions of article 334 of the Labour Code for a collective agreement to be mandatory. In addition, this enterprise states that not one labour law violation has been determined in any of the inspections carried out in the enterprise.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254203, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that, according to the Government, in the case of the SITRAPAN union, the denial resulted from an objection from the owner, who alleged that there was no employment relationship as the contract of all of the workers had ended two months prior to the preliminary registration, that they were fixed-term workers as a result of a public tendering process, and that they had not challenged the objection when they had the opportunity to do so. In the case of SITRASALIM, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the labour administration denied the union鈥檚 final registration owing to its non-compliance with the legal requirements concerning the inclusion of the names of the founding members, a lack of clarity as to the name of the trade union in the documents submitted, and non-compliance with the minimum number of members 鈥?established in section 292 of the Labour Code as 20 per cent for the public sector in institutions of up to 500聽employees. In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall the principle whereby 鈥渨hile a minimum membership requirement is not in itself incompatible with Convention No. 87, the number should be fixed in a reasonable manner so that the establishment of organizations is not hindered鈥?and 鈥渨hat constitutes a reasonable number may vary according to the particular conditions in which a restriction is imposed鈥?[see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, para. 287]. In the light of this principle, and taking into account the fact that section聽292 of the Labour Code, by requiring 20 per cent of workers to be affiliated in public sector institutions of up to 500聽employees, could result in a requirement of up to 100聽workers to establish a trade union, the Committee requests the Government to review this provision in consultation with the social partners concerned in order to not, in effect, undermine the right of public sector employees to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. In the case of SINTRAMAE, the Committee observes that its final registration was denied because it did not have the minimum of 20 members required by section 292 of the Labour Code for enterprise trade unions. In the case of SINFAPAVI, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that registration was denied as a result of an objection from the enterprise, which alleged that there had been irregularities in the establishment of the union, but that it has not provided further details. The Committee therefore urges the Government to provide detailed information on the alleged legal irregularities in the establishment of SINFAPAVI which led it to deny the union its final registration. In the light of the numerous allegations of interference by management relying on legal provisions to object to the final registration of trade unions, the Committee invites the Government to review on a tripartite basis without delay the use of employers鈥?powers to contest the registration of unions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254203, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the complainant provided a list of the trade unionists purportedly dismissed by the SAS, but did not provide names or other precise information concerning the other alleged dismissals in the other enterprises. Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government has provided information on various complaints made against some of those enterprises, and indicates that the administrative authorities are handling the complaints and holding meetings to mediate between the parties. In this connection, recalling that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for many years been observing the need to strengthen legal provisions against anti-union discrimination, and that this Committee has in the past requested 鈥渢he Government, in consultation with the social partners, to ensure effective national procedures for the prevention and sanctioning of anti-union discrimination鈥?[see Case No. 2648, 355th聽Report, para. 963], the Committee invites the Government to hold consultations with the social partners to establish mechanisms to guarantee effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including rapid and impartial procedures, with provision for appeals and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions.

With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the SAS, the Committee notes the explanations of the SAS that the situation was one of expiry and non-renewal of contracts and that the contracts of all union leaders enjoying trade union immunity were later renewed, as were the contracts of most of the workers affected by the non-renewal. With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the PROSEGUR enterprise, the Committee refers to its examination of the allegations in Case No. 3010 [see 375th Report, paras 438鈥?59]. With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals by the IPFSA and MAEHARA enterprises, the Committee observes that the Government refers to the dismissal cases of two employees of the MAEHARA enterprise, who reportedly reached an agreement including compensation, but it is not possible to determine whether those workers were trade union members. As to the IPFSA enterprise, it merely states that no labour law violations have been established in any of the inspections conducted at the request of the union. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government to provide further information on the allegations of anti-union dismissals made against the MAEHARA and IPFSA enterprises. In this regard, and taking into account the general nature of the allegations of anti-union discrimination it has received, the Committee invites the complainants to provide additional information so that it may examine those and other allegations of anti-union dismissals and discrimination in greater detail, and to seek the relevant additional observations from the Government.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254203, response status: 200"

On 26 September, the trade union was registered in accordance with Resolution No. 62/2011 of the Office of the Deputy Minister for Labour of Paraguay. The enterprise Prosegur Paraguay, SA was informed of this by telegram. The complainants allege that once the enterprise had been informed of the establishment of the trade union, it dismissed the following workers, who it identified as promoters and organizers within the trade union: Mr V铆ctor Fretes, Mr聽P铆o聽Antonio Hermoza, Mr Carlos Denis and Mr Esteban Gonz谩lez, the press and public relations secretary. The complainants state that it was not possible to bring a case before the courts requesting their reinstatement, as they did not possess reliable documentation to corroborate their status as union organizers.鈥?The complainants add that, on 23 December 2011, the trade union informed the employer of its intention to promote the negotiation of a collective agreement on working conditions and submitted a draft that had been approved by the assembly of the trade union. According to the complainants, the enterprise employed delaying tactics and the trade union turned to the administrative authority, requesting it to mediate. They state that, on 2 May 2012, representatives of the enterprise and the trade union signed an initial agreement establishing a period of two months at the end of which both parties would sign the collective agreement on working conditions, once the negotiations were complete. The complainant organizations allege that, once the period of two months had elapsed, the agreement was never signed owing to the enterprise鈥檚 unwillingness to continue with the negotiations.鈥?The complainants allege that, during the negotiating process, the following trade union members were dismissed: Mr Antonio Robledo, Mr Hermenegildo Areco, Mr V铆ctor Mart铆nez, Mr Heriberto Ortiz and Mr Alfredo Ram铆rez. The complainants state that, in this context, the workers who were members of SITEPROPASA, satisfying all the legal requirements, decided to hold an eight-day strike from 18 to 26 July 2012 (the strike was extended to 4 August 2012). The complainants allege that the enterprise carried out acts of persecution and intimidation against the workers from the beginning of the strike. In particular, they state that several trade union leaders and members received telephone calls at home from employees of the enterprise, who informed their families that any worker who participated in the strike would be dismissed and would no longer be able to support their family. Furthermore, they allege that law enforcement officers were present at the picket line and marches, in order to intimidate the strikers.鈥?The complainants add that the enterprise recruited new workers during the strike, which was confirmed by the administrative labour authority. They indicate that, during the strike, a tripartite meeting was held at the Ministry of Labour, which was attended by the Minister for Labour herself and at which the workers were requested and advised to end their protest action. According to the complainants, the highest authorities of the Ministry undertook to continue mediating between the parties and to guarantee that the workers would not suffer reprisals. However, the complainants allege that from that moment the authorities abandoned the workers who were members of the trade union to their fate. The complainants state that the workers decided to end the strike on 27 July 2012 and that, when they returned to work on 30 July, they were summoned individually by the enterprise and, in the absence of an adviser or legal representative, were informed of the enterprise鈥檚 intention to have the strike declared unlawful (the enterprise submitted a request to the Fourth Circuit Labour Court of First Instance of the city of Asunci贸n to that end), which would result in them being dismissed without pay. The complainants add that, in this context, the workers were pressured into signing an agreement that would terminate their employment contracts and which established the compensation to be paid, the notice period and other particulars, as if it were an unjustified dismissal or a justified withdrawal from service. The complainants allege that, in this way, the enterprise succeeded in dismissing 230 trade union members, and that those workers who had refused to sign the letters terminating their employment relationship were dismissed. The complainants state that it is worth noting that the enterprise subsequently withdrew on 20 August 2012 its request to have the strike declared unlawful. According to the complainants, a number of trade union leaders accepted compensation as 鈥渁n agreement to terminate their employment relationship by mutual consent鈥? which many only accepted after having been subjected to undue pressure. The complainants also allege that, when those dismissed workers seek employment in other enterprises in the sector, to their surprise, and despite meeting all the necessary criteria, they are informed that they cannot be hired because Prosegur Paraguay, SA has published a list containing the names of the striking workers.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3241126, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the complainants鈥?allegation is not concerned with the collective agreement signed with representatives of the workers but with the fact that the enterprise had been previously negotiating with SITEPROPASA. In a request from the enterprise dated 21 December 2012, relating to an administrative decision (No. 1362 of 10 December 2012), which is included in the documents sent by the Government, it is stated that 鈥溾€?the representatives of the workers were appointed by an official letter dated 26 October 2012, in accordance with sections 326 and 327 and related provisions of the Labour Code; moreover, other workers on other dates endorsed the actions of the representatives through documents that were attached to this file 鈥︹€? The Committee also observes that these (non-union) representatives were appointed after the end of the strike and the series of dismissals alleged by the complainants. The Committee wishes to recall that the Collective Agreements Recommendation, 1951 (No. 91), provides that: 鈥淔or the purpose of this Recommendation, the term 鈥渃ollective agreements鈥?means all agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers鈥?organisations, on the one hand, and one or more representatives workers鈥?organisations, or in the absence of such organisations, the representatives of the workers duly elected and authorised by them, in accordance with national laws and regulations, on the other.鈥?In this respect, the Committee has emphasized that the said Recommendation stresses the role of workers鈥?organizations as one of the parties in collective bargaining. Direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, by-passing representative organizations where these exist, might in certain cases be detrimental to the principle that negotiation between employers and organizations of workers should be encouraged and promoted.

According to the complainants, the highest authorities of the Ministry undertook to continue mediating between the parties and to guarantee that the workers would not suffer reprisals. However, the complainants allege that from that moment the authorities abandoned the workers who were members of the trade union to their fate. The complainants state that the workers decided to end the strike on 27 July 2012 and that, when they returned to work on 30 July, they were summoned individually by the enterprise and, in the absence of an adviser or legal representative, were informed of the enterprise鈥檚 intention to have the strike declared unlawful (the enterprise submitted a request to the Fourth Circuit Labour Court of First Instance of the city of Asunci贸n to that end), which would result in them being dismissed without pay. The complainants add that, in this context, the workers were pressured into signing an agreement that would terminate their employment contracts and which established the compensation to be paid, the notice period and other particulars, as if it were an unjustified dismissal or a justified withdrawal from service. The complainants allege that, in this way, the enterprise succeeded in dismissing 230 trade union members, and that those workers who had refused to sign the letters terminating their employment relationship were dismissed. The complainants state that it is worth noting that the enterprise subsequently withdrew on 20 August 2012 its request to have the strike declared unlawful. According to the complainants, a number of trade union leaders accepted compensation as 鈥渁n agreement to terminate their employment relationship by mutual consent鈥? which many only accepted after having been subjected to undue pressure.

In 2010, Itaip煤 Binacional 鈥?Lado Paraguayo concluded a new collective agreement on working conditions with the trade unions, STEIBI, STICCAP, SICHAP, SICAE and SISE, which would govern labour relations between the enterprise and its employees for the period 1聽May 2010 to 31 April 2011. The various labour benefits that the enterprise granted to its workers included a housing policy whereby it would provide its workers with housing that they would own. In that connection, Itaip煤 Binacional 鈥?Lado Paraguayo decided to invite the unions, of which its workers were members, to discuss and negotiate the transfer of homes to the employees who were living in them. Thus, it was agreed with various trade unions that the homes would be sold to the employees who were living in them at below the national market price and that, as compensation (for loss of the housing benefit), they would receive 30 per cent of the value of the home (Addendum No. 1 to the collective agreement for the period 2010鈥?1).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3237679, response status: 200"

Because the parties鈥?opinions on those matters are sharply divided (for example, on the question of the bipartite committee envisaged in the collective agreement), it invites the Government to institute an investigation through the labour inspectorate and to keep it informed of the outcome without delay.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3237679, response status: 200"

SINATT states that the transport enterprise La Santaniana SA is part of a holding company comprising 24 companies that belong to one employers鈥?group, in the majority of which there is no union precisely because of the group鈥檚 anti-union practices. SINATT maintains that, although the workers鈥?rights are inalienable, the founder members of the workers鈥?committee have been coerced into signing a document, the seventh clause of which states that they abide by Ministry of Justice and Labour Resolution No. 791 and expressly refrain from contesting its provisions.

During this period (almost five months), the employers managed to break up the workers鈥?committee through antiunion measures and without any reaction from the Ministry of Justice and Labour. The rejection of SINATT鈥檚 application for reconsideration was based on the argument that the principle of legality prevents the Ministry from examining such an appeal. When the employers lodged a similar appeal, however, the Ministry not only allowed it to proceed, but actually ruled in favour of the employers, something that is specifically prohibited by Paraguayan labour law and ILO Convention No. 87.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912561, response status: 200"

The argument put forward for this is that there is no provision in the Labour Code or in the by-laws of SINATT for such a works council, and none of the members of the works council belonged to the union. As regards the question whether the works council members at the company are SINATT members, the legal advisors of the General Directorate of Legal Advisory Services met with the Department of Collective Relations and Trade Union Registration, of the Subsecretariat of State for Labour and Social Security, subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and Labour, in order to determine whether the relevant workers are members of SINATT. The background documents of the union available to the Subsecretariat indicate that those listed as members of the workers鈥?committee at La Santaniana SA are not listed as SINATT members, and thus the requirements of section 304 of the Labour Code are not met; according to the provision in question, the union is required under subparagraph (b) each year to give the names of all persons who have joined or left [the committee]. 鈥淎rticle 107 of the SINATT by-laws stipulates that, in order to be elected as a delegate, a member must be at least 18 years of age, hold Paraguayan nationality (either from birth or by naturalization), have at least one year鈥檚 length of service in his or her job, and must have been a member of the union for the same period.

As regards allegations of police repression, the report states that the demonstrators, comprising mainly employees of the Association of Union Employees of ANDE, attempted to force their way into the National Congress via 14 May Street.

An appeal was lodged against this ruling in the Supreme Court, which ruled the appeal admissible, thereby suspending the measures taken against the strikers by the lower courts. Despite this, in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling, ANDE initiated 800 summary proceedings as a result of which 70 workers were dismissed, another 80 were suspended, 30 were transferred and hundreds of others were given warnings. SITRANDE again appealed against these measures before the Supreme Court, which issued interim rulings on 29 June and 3 and 26 July ordering the suspension of the dismissals, suspensions, transfers and warnings; there has to date been no response from ANDE. At the same time, the labour courts ordered the reinstatement in their former posts of nine trade union officers, but despite this, ANDE transferred them. The workers in question disregarded this decision and as a result, summary administrative proceedings were initiated and payment of their wages was stopped.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906061, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that, according to the information supplied by the complainants, the strikes of 27 January and 22 February were declared illegal under the anti-strike law adopted as part of the state reform programme; the first strike was declared illegal because of the failure by the organizers to meet the notification requirements, in that they notified ANDE and not the Ministry of Justice and Labour; the complainants do not indicate the reasons for which the second strike was declared illegal. The Committee notes that the Supreme Court, in decisions handed down on 29 June and on 3 and 26 July, temporarily suspended all the measures adopted previously by the lower courts against the strikers, and notes with concern that even after these rulings, ANDE initiated 80 summary proceedings resulting in the dismissal of 70 workers, the suspension of 80 workers, the transfer of 30 workers and hundreds of warnings being issued. At any event, the Committee recalls that arrests and dismissals of strikers on a large scale involve a serious risk of abuse, and place freedom of association in grave jeopardy. The competent authorities should be given appropriate instructions so as to obviate the dangers to freedom of association that such arrests and dismissals involve [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, 1996, para. 604].

In a communication of 24 April 2012, CESITEP reports that Mr Barreto Medina is still in prison five months later, which brings the time he has served up to two years and eight months, which should entitle him to parole and that Mr Alan Flores is still a refugee in Argentina. By a communication of 24聽May 2012, CESITEP states that the Government agreed to mediation by the Inter American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in order to look for common ground and explore possibilities for an amicable solution with the claimants, and that they have accordingly been invited to take part in a forum for dialogue, but that the Government seeks only to prolong the process. CESITEP adds that Mr Barreto Medina has already been imprisoned for seven months, that he has completed two-thirds of the four-year sentence, that the prison officers describe his conduct as exemplary, yet despite all this he has not been granted the parole that section 51 of the Penal Code entitles him to. In its communication of 25 October 2012, the CESITEP informs that, on 20 July, the trade union leader Barreto Medina was released on probation but that the Public Prosecutor has appealed the decision.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3087420, response status: 200"

In the ruling handed down in first instance, the then judge Hugo L贸pez had sentenced 23 persons to terms of imprisonment of ten, seven and four years for their part in the embezzlement of bank assets, those persons including the former bank president, who received the maximum sentence, along with the other former bank administrators. An appeal was lodged against the ruling before the Appeals Chamber. The trade unionists who were sentenced have sought to have the legal proceedings annulled on the grounds that they related to debt. For that purpose, they presented as alleged new facts the cases brought by the bankrupted BNT against the CESITEP, CUT and CPT, which had expired. After several months of investigation, the appeal was rejected by the court, and the defence again appealed against that decision. This was also unsuccessful on the grounds that the period allowed had elapsed, and the plaintiffs then appealed again in mid-2005. Faced with this situation, the Appeals Chamber referred the case to the Supreme Court of Justice, which means that examination of the original sentences has again been postponed until the appeal is decided. It is worth noting that, in December 2003, Alan Flores, Jer贸nimo L贸pez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina applied to the court to suspend the precautionary measures imposed on them (house arrest), basing their application on article 19 of the National Constitution and on sections 236, 250 and others of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The First Chamber of the Criminal Court of Appeal upheld the application and consequently suspended the measures imposed on the trade union officials, ordering them to report any change of address or travel outside the country in writing to the courts and to the police.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905819, response status: 200"

In the ruling handed down in first instance, the then judge Hugo L贸pez sentenced some 23 persons to terms of imprisonment of ten, seven and four years for their part in embezzling bank assets, those persons including the former bank president Edgar Cataldi, who received the maximum sentence, along with the other former bank administrators. The judge in his ruling concluded that losses incurred by the bank as a result of this amounted to 120 billion guaran铆es. An appeal was lodged against the ruling before the Appeals Chamber. The trade unionists who were sentenced have sought to have the legal proceedings annulled on the grounds that they related to debt. After several months of investigation, the appeal was rejected, and the defence again appealed against that decision. This was also unsuccessful on the grounds that the period allowed had elapsed, and the plaintiffs then appealed again in mid-2005. Faced with this situation, the Appeals Chamber referred the case to the Supreme Court of Justice, which means that examination of the original sentences has again been postponed until the appeal is decided. The Government adds that, in December 2003, Alan Flores, Jer贸nimo L贸pez and Reinaldo Barreto Medina applied to the court to suspend the precautionary measures imposed on them (house arrest), basing their application on article 19 of the National Constitution and sections 236, 250 and others of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The First Chamber of the Criminal Court of Appeal on 31 December 2003 upheld the application and consequently suspended the measures imposed on the trade union officials, leaving the workers concerned at liberty but ordering them to report any change of address or travel outside the country in writing to the courts and police.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905814, response status: 200"

On that occasion, the Committee formulated the following recommendations:The Committee notes the fact that the trade union leaders Alan Flores and Jer贸nimo L贸pez are currently under house arrest. However, taking into account its previous comments, the serious flaws in the legal proceedings concerning the two trade union leaders noted in the previous examination of the case, the time gone by since the sentence was handed down in the first instance (over one year) without the relevant appeal having been decided, and the fact that the accused have already served the minimum sentence imposed on them in the first instance, the Committee profoundly regrets that no measure has been taken to release Reinaldo Barreto Medina, Jer贸nimo L贸pez and Alan Flores. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take measures to this end and hopes that a decision will be handed down in the very near future on the judicial appeals filed and that they will take into account the provisions of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings that Florinda Insaurralde may bring against resolution No. 321/99 and Decree No. 7081/2000, which led to her dismissal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905807, response status: 200"

No. 1208 of 12 July 1999 by Health Centre Central Laboratory No. 8, in the XVIII Sanitary Region. This transfer took place as part of the reorganization of the Ministry, which, owing to a budgetary shortfall for that year, was forced to redistribute human resources in order to carry out changes in the new administration and to reorganize services. As Mr. Weiler was an experienced civil servant, particularly in the area of national resources, he was sent to Health Centre No. 8 to organize the area and thus implement such services and take inventory of the institution. Subsequently, Mr. Weiler turned up at Health Centre No. 8 only once to work and then did not appear in the workplace again. An administrative inquiry was initiated and copies of the institution's timesheets showed absence from work and therefore presumed abandonment of his post. Following the conclusions of the administrative inquiry, Mr. Weiler was dismissed from his post by Decree No. 7332 of 31 January 2000. The Government emphasizes that according to the report of the chief of the section on collective relations and union membership, to be found in the records of the case, Mr. Weiler did not have union protection.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905840, response status: 200"

Furthermore, the sanitary region of Itap煤a had asked for Ms. Marcia Rivas de G贸mez to be transferred to San Juan del Paran谩 as it was impossible to recruit people to conduct the national immunization day because of lack of funds for contracts and, due to this, a lack of human resources.

In this respect, the Committee notes that although the transfer in question occurred long before the conflict reported in this case, Mr. Weiler held two union positions and the Committee does not exclude the fact that the transfer in question might have affected his ability to carry out his activities as a leader. In these circumstances, the Committee emphasizes that ""one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.""

In these circumstances, although the transfer took place eight days after the call to strike, the Committee does not have sufficient information to confirm that the transfer in question occurred for anti-union reasons, particularly in light of the fact that according to the Government the union leader in question was transferred back to her original position in the city of Encarnaci贸n on 10 July 2000.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905840, response status: 200"

To date, the Ministry of Health refuses to respond to workers' requests to comply with it, even violating Decree No. 6109 regulating the Public Health Code (the Health Act), which governs administrative careers within the Ministry of Health; it also ignores the hierarchical structure, only promoting officials in one specialized area and discriminating against others, and not allowing the trade union, despite the fact that the collective agreement so provides, to participate in the preparation of salary scale reclassifications.

This change necessarily led to the redistribution of human resources in order to optimize them in accordance with the needs of the various services. For this reason, the Director-General of the Medical Emergencies Centre made Mr. William Ledesma and Ms. Magdalena Duarte available to the General Directorate of Human Resources on 8 July 1999.

In this regard, while taking due account of the budgetary problems that may have led the Ministry of Health to carry out transfers in order to fill vacant posts, the Committee cannot fail to observe that the workers in question held trade union positions and that their transfer may have affected the exercise of their trade union activities. The Committee, therefore, requests the Government to ensure that in future, when for budgetary or financial reasons it is necessary to carry out staff transfers in the public sector, due account is taken of the status of trade union officials, and that steps are taken to avoid any negative repercussions on the performance of their trade union activities and to avoid possible discrimination against them.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905329, response status: 200"

In this respect, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, para. 47). The Committee also emphasizes that the detention of leaders of workers' and employers' organizations for activities in connection with the exercise of their right to organize and to strike is contrary to the principles of freedom of association and that measures depriving trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights (see Digest, op. cit., paras. 69 and 77).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903766, response status: 200"

More specifically, the Committee would like to point out to the Government that the right to the inviolability of the premises of workers' and employers' organizations, which is an essential element of the rights recognized under Convention No. 87 has as ""an indispensable corollary (...) that the public authorities may not insist on entering premises without a judicial warrant authorizing them to do so"". (See Digest, 1985, para. 203; 230th Report, Case No. 1200 (Chile), para. 610; 238th Report, Case No. 1169 (Nicaragua), para. 227; and 241st Report, Case No. 1285 (Chile), para. 192.) In this connection, the Committee condemns the search of the headquarters of FEPRINCO and the confiscation of documents and materials, both of which violate the fundamental rights of employers' organizations, and requests the Government to return immediately the documents and materials to FEPRINCO, and to conduct an inquiry in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding these actions and, where appropriate, to punish those responsible.

Lastly, they stated that the accounts had nothing to do with the acts of violence, and that the representatives of the trade union organizations appeared before the parliamentary committee simply to give their version of the facts and that intervention, for no valid reason, in the internal affairs of the trade unions would set a dangerous precedent.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903089, response status: 200"

The purpose of this coordination centre was simply to ensure that the strike would pass without incident and without resulting in disputes and damage to the physical and material well-being of the workers, employers, police officers and any other persons. With this in mind the three trade union organizations were asked to appoint representatives to participate actively in the coordination process. Labour inspectors, fax equipment, telephones, transport and other means of communication were made available in an attempt to ensure that the strike, which according to statements made by its leaders, was based on social claims, did not become violent and thus undermine the exercise of this right, which in fact is unfortunately what happened.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903089, response status: 200"

However, as the hours passed and the morning approached the situation deteriorated and became more complicated with the blocking of a major road linking the capital with both the interior of the country and the commuter suburbs surrounding the capital, with the burning of tyres, and many other acts that the Government had hoped could be avoided through its appeals and the office it had set up. In addition, a group of trade unionists closed the road linking the whole of the western region, the Chaco, with the remainder of the country by way of sit-down protests, the staking of posts, logs and other materials, in open violation of the rights to free passage and to work by those who did not support the strike. Given this situation, which considerably exceeded the boundaries of the workers' right to strike, attempts were made to reason with them to end their unlawful conduct, but they refused to respect constitutional and legal rights, even despite one attempt at mediation by the chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, thereby showing little awareness of the aims, scope and procedure that should govern a strike. The Government states that no repressive measures whatsoever were taken that were not in response to the senseless attitude of certain trade unionists who, in an attempt to impose their ideas by violently intimidating those persons who did not wish to join the strike, set up roadblocks, held sit-down protests, burnt tyres, shattered the windscreens of public transport vehicles with stones and even guns, scattered nails to puncture tyres and put pressure on the drivers and passengers of public transport vehicles to return to their homes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903089, response status: 200"

Subsequently, having requested the demonstrators to leave the road, and given their steadfast refusal to see reason and comply with the law, an attempt was made to break up the demonstration using tear-gas. The demonstrators responded to this violently, throwing stones and other objects at the security forces, and it was then that the unfortunate incident occurred which resulted in Sebasti谩n Larrosa losing his life.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903089, response status: 200"

In this connection, since the Government did not expressly deny the possibility that an inquiry of this kind could occur in this or in other cases, and given that the parliamentary committee had initially decided to conduct an inquiry (although subsequently it did not go ahead), the Committee would like to recall the principle whereby ""searches of trade union premises should be made only following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority where that authority is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for supposing that evidence exists on the premises material to a prosecution for a penal offence and on condition that the search be restricted to the purpose in respect of which the warrant was issued"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 3rd edition, 1985, para. 205). Furthermore, in this specific case the Committee realizes the importance of conducting inquiries to shed light on the acts of violence, but does not consider the search of the trade union premises to be useful in this connection. Whatever the case may be, a search of this kind should only take place if a warrant has been issued by the judicial authority.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903089, response status: 200"

Finally, the complainant organization points out that the Supreme Court of Justice issued a precautionary measure which has temporarily suspended the implementation of the Decree.

More specifically, the IUF states that this Decree violates article 96 of the National Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of association, and section 283 of the Labour Code, which establishes that trade union organizations shall be entitled to draw up their own constitutions and administrative rules, to elect their bodies and representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and lawful activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902649, response status: 200"

One of the most precious principles of international law is the right of peoples to self-determination, and thus interference in the internal affairs of a country which has established all the institutions for the defence of human rights is not only unjustified but raises a preliminary issue, and therefore the ILO should refrain from considering any kind of action in this particular case.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902649, response status: 200"

It points out that the Labour Code in force empowers the labour administration authorities to supervise the application of the constitutions of trade unions and the legitimacy of persons claiming to represent them, as is categorically stated in the preamble of the Decree. At the same time, under the Constitution, the first standard which must be observed in determining the legality of legal texts is the National Constitution, which prescribes that all organizations, including trade unions, shall elect their leaders by direct, secret and universal vote of their members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902649, response status: 200"

Since the effectiveness of any standard requires the establishment of penalties to be applied in the event that it is not observed, the labour administration authority has been authorized to revoke the legal personality of associations which fail to comply with this provision. The reason for this provision is easy to understand since many persons, claiming to be opponents or to be in exile have made it their business to swindle and embezzle the people under the guise of promoting trade unionism. For an elementary reason of moral probity, the labour administration authority cannot be a party to such anomalies, and thus it has been clearly established in the Decree that the present trade union leaders may during the course of the reorganization of their unions carry out acts for the administration and preservation of their assets, but under no circumstances may they dispose of such assets, which would be tantamount to the embezzlement of legitimately elected trade union leaders.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902649, response status: 200"

However, the Committee notes that the regulations contained in the Decree go well beyond these objectives.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902649, response status: 200"

However, the Committee regrets that Decree No. 16.769 should have been adopted arbitrarily and that the text, in violation of the provisions of Article 3 of Convention No. 87 (which establishes that workers' organizations shall have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules and to elect their representatives in full freedom), regulates in no less than 50 sections, and in an extremely detailed and meticulous manner, every aspect of the election of trade union officials. In addition, the Decree implies the cancellation of the legal personality of trade union organizations that do not conform to the provisions of the Decree, which is a serious violation of Convention No. 87.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902649, response status: 200"

The Committee therefore invites the Government to take the necessary measures to review the text of the above-mentioned Decree, in consultation with workers' organizations, with a view to guaranteeing the independence of trade union organizations, and to repeal all provisions that imply an interference in the right of trade unions freely to elect their leaders, and in particular those provisions mentioned by the complainant organizations.

The Government adds that the strike in this enterprise was promoted and followed by only 38 of the 300 workers in the enterprise from 1 May 1992 and that the trade union leader, Mr. Pedro Saledo, removed the negotiation process from its normal framework, i.e. within the Ministry of Justice and Labour, and took it to the parliamentary level.

However, in no case does this minimum level entitle workers to an additional bonus. According to the manager, the workers were hindered in carrying out their work by Messrs.

On 15 June 1992 the Board notified the workers on strike that they had 24 hours to return to their workplaces, and this decision was appealed by the trade union to the Board.

The Committee notes that, according to the documentation sent by the Government, the dispute was submitted in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Labour Procedure to the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration, which notified the workers on strike that if they did not return to their workplaces they would be subject to dismissal. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the substitution by legislation of arbitration for the right to strike as a means of resolving labour disputes can only be justified in respect of essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 3rd edition, paras. 387 and 420). The services provided by a refrigeration enterprise are not essential services in this sense of the term. The Committee would also recall that for a number of years the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been making, in the same spirit, critical observations on sections 284 (submission of collective disputes to compulsory arbitration) and 291 of the Code of Labour Procedure (dismissal of workers who do not resume work when required to do so by the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902456, response status: 200"

The Committee emphasises that no one should be subject to dismissal or prejudicial measures as a result of exercising legitimate trade union activities, such as the establishment of a trade union, and that under Article 2 of Convention No. 98, workers should be given adequate protection against any act of discrimination which would restrict freedom of association in relation to their employment.

The Committee deeply deplores the lack of cooperation by the Government in the Committee's procedures, and in particular the fact that it has sent no information on the allegations made. Because of the time which has elapsed since the presentation of these complaints, the Committee is thus obliged to examine this case without being able to take into account the Government's observations on the allegations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902453, response status: 200"

The Committee thus regrets that the Government has not yet taken measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees public officials and employees the right to organise, despite the numerous recommendations made by the Committee in other cases (see 259th Report, Case No. 1341, paras. 511 and 512) and the repeated requests by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this effect. The Committee once again asks the Government as a matter of urgency to take the necessary measures to establish in its national legislation the right to organise of public officials and employees and expresses the hope that the Supreme Court of Justice, in its verdict on the trade union status of the APAV, will take full account of the obligations of Paraguay resulting from the ratification of Convention No. 87.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902041, response status: 200"

Antonio Garc铆a, Ralf Gehre, Ren茅 Salom贸n and Francisco Montanaro (leaders of the Paraguay Flight Attendants' Association) violate Article 1 of Convention No. 98, and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that L铆neas A茅reas Paraguayas will immediately reinstate these four trade union leaders, and to keep the Committee informed in this connection.(d)The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to guarantee that flight attendants' organisations enjoy the right to bargain collectively by means of collective agreements.(e)As regards Case No. 1510, the Committee reiterates the recommendations which it formulated at its May 1990 meeting, which are as follows:- As regards the allegation that 519 workers in different branches of activity and enterprises, identified by name, have been dismissed for having sought to organise or join a trade union, the Committee emphasises the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to set up and join trade unions, and that workers should benefit from adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation, and to keep it informed in this connection.- As regards the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Clandelino Benitez, a leader of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salceco, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.- As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of a strike at the Ita茂pu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on 12 December 1989, the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also requests to be kept informed of the results of any such inquiry.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902040, response status: 200"

(Paraguay Cotton Company, CAPSA) (one of which, according to the complainant, was set up and is influenced and directed by the enterprise, and has been recognised by the Labour Directorate); the dismissal of several trade union leaders, including Pedro Salcedo; police interference in several meetings called by Mr. Salcedo and the declaration that a strike called by the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo was illegal. According to the Government, the Labour Directorate was awaiting a court decision regarding the legitimacy of one of the two executive committees, for the purpose of registering it. Nevertheless, the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dated back to 1987 and, according to the complainant, it was in that year that the Labour Directorate recognised the other executive committee. The Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour ordered the negotiation of a new collective agreement and specified that the other executive committee was to represent workers in the negotiations. More specifically, as concerns the strike that began during the harvest on 30 August 1989 and was followed by 95 per cent of workers in the CAPSA enterprise, the complainant reports that the strike was suspended at the request of the enterprise on 4 September when the Conciliation and Arbitration Board declared the strike illegal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

It recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that it has stated on numerous occasions that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply information and its observations on the application concerning the banning of the strike by workers in the CAPSA company, together with any information on developments in the labour dispute within this company.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

It also requests the Government to inform the Committee of the reasons which led to the dismissal of trade unionists Antonia Jara Paredes and Canuta Ozuna de Ledesma.(d) The Committee deeply regrets the detention, psychological pressures and threats against trade unionist Cira Novara and her subsequent dismissal and requests the Government to inform it of the specific events and acts on which the charges are based, to state whether a judicial hearing has been instituted, and if so, to specify its outcome.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

In response, the Ministry of Education and Culture threatened to dismiss and disqualify teachers participating in such a strike, in violation of Convention No. 87. The text of the communication by the Ministry of Education and Culture was as follows:The Ministry of Education and Culture informs all teachers, heads of households and the population at large that, in response to the concerns expressed by the country's teachers, and in particular to their wish for an overall improvement in their conditions of life, as well as the progress of education in the country, it is working to reach such objectives through the appropriate legal channels.However, at the same time, it reminds the petitioners of the provisions contained in article 55 of the national Constitution, which states that: ""All Paraguyan citizens have the right to hold public office and employment with no conditions other than fitness for the position in question. Public officials and employees are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes, as well as from collectively leaving their posts."" Furthermore, article 123 states that: ""All residents are required to comply with and obey this Constitution and the laws, decrees, resolutions and other provisions which the public authorities may issue in accordance with their mandate.""Likewise, the Ministry recalls the provisions of Act No. 200 on the status of public officials, and in particular the following sections: ""Section 36: Public officials may not adopt collective resolutions against provisions issued by the competent authorities."" ""Section 37: Public officials are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes. For the purposes of this Act, a work stoppage is considered as a collective suspension of services, and a strike as a collective absence from work. Strikes shall also include the collective refusal of public officials, or individual refusals which take place within an interval of ten days by more than five officials in the same unit."" ""Section 38: Public officials who infringe the provisions of the foregoing section will be disqualified from holding public employment for a period of two to five years. Public officials who are found guilty of threatening work stoppages or strikes will be subject to dismissal."" ""Section 39: Public officials are prohibited from using the premises or property of the administration for any purpose other than the performance of their specific tasks.""Thus, given the rule of law, the Ministry warns those concerned that the above-mentioned sanctions and legal provisions will be applied in the event of any transgressions of said provisions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

The secretary of the Organisation, Hilda Montiel de R铆os, has been suspended from the Francisco Solano L贸pez School for having defended the OTEP before the school's students and teachers against accusations made by the school's director. In spite of the fact that these explanations were well received by the students and teachers, on 20 August 1990 the school's director relieved this teacher of her functions accusing her of insubordination and rebellion, and requested the Ministry of Education and Culture to fill the vacancy. According to the allegations, this dismissal is unacceptable, inasmuch as the school's director has neither the authority nor the competence to act in this manner, since such procedures fall to the competence of the Ministry. According to the complainant, this case must be viewed against the background of administrative corruption, warnings and the suspensions of certain members of the OTEP. On 23 August 1990 a delegation composed of teachers from the region, students, heads of households and the attorney for the Organisation's regional branch presented a formal complaint before the Ministry of Education. They were assured that a solution would be found to the problem of the teacher, Mrs. Hilda Montiel de R铆os.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

On 12 November some 150 members of the army fired on a group of 40 peasants in Tava-I and Almeida, Guauauvi district, Department of San Pedro, and imprisoned most of them in the Curuguaty post. These are armed assaults on groups of peasants who have peacefully occupied uncultivated land in order to draw the Government's attention to the growing problems of over 250,000 peasants who still have no land, in spite of the Government's creation of the Rural Development Co-ordinating Committee.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

The Committee must recall the considerations presented in its First Report (para. 31, approved by the Governing Body in March 1952), which it has had to repeat on several occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, as the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be brought against them.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

The Committee urges the Government in the future to send detailed replies to allegations without delay.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

Bearing in mind that the authorities' refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dates back to 1987, the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring that legislation will facilitate the expeditious disposition of proceedings involving labour-related matters. Moreover, since the Government has provided no information concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike which, according to the complainants, was followed by 95 per cent of the workers of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. enterprise, the Committee again emphasises that the right to strike constitutes an essential means for workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests, and that limitations on, or the prohibition of strikes may only apply in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (those where an interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). It considers that this definition does not cover this present case.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

Consequently, given the Government's failure to reply, the Committee draws its attention to Article 1 of Convention No. 98, which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"", and emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

In general, on the question of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation on the trade union rights of teachers who are also public officials, the Committee emphasises that workers in the education sector should enjoy the right to establish trade union organisations, to bargain collectively and to resort to strikes (see 226th Report, Case No. 1166 (Honduras), paras. 343 and 344; see also the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 3rd edition, 1985, paras. 394, 404 and 601).

The Committee deplores the Government's lack of co-operation and urges it in the future to submit detailed replies without delay.(b) As regards the proceedings for the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company), and the reinstatement of trade union leaders dismissed since 1987, the Committee again emphasises that the absence of a court ruling over such a long period of time constitutes a denial of justice, and therefore a denial of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the legislation will facilitate labour-related judicial proceedings.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that workers in cotton companies do not provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term, and consequently that their right to strike should not be subject to serious restrictions or prohibitions, either in law or in practice.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees to workers in the education sector the right to establish trade unions, to bargain collectively and to strike.(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to Article 1 of Convention No. 98, which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take measures for the reinstatement of the teacher trade unionist, Mrs. Montiel de R铆os.(f) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the trade unionists of the National Peasants' Union, Messrs. Flores, Melgarejo and Pereira have been released, and requests all parties involved to seek to resolve peacefully problems which may arise from agrarian reform and rural development.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901951, response status: 200"

Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation and to keep it informed in this connection.- As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Claudelino Ben铆tez, a leader of the ""Munich"" Brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salcedo, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.- As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of the strike at the Ita茂pu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on 12 December 1989, the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also asks to be kept informed of the results of any such inquiry.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901891, response status: 200"

Thus, the Committee points out to the Government that the dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organisation or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association; it reiterates that workers must be provided with adequate protection against anti-union discrimination. The Committee also recalls that it is the responsibility of the competent authorities, and particularly the Government, to ensure that these principles are applied.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901891, response status: 200"

The Committee has also noted the slowness of judicial proceedings in other cases relating to anti-union dismissals (see, for example, 251st Report, Case No. 1275, para. 88, where judicial proceedings lasted four years). Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that workers who have been dismissed for trade union activities are reinstated in their jobs, and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901891, response status: 200"

Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation, and to keep it informed in this connection.- As regards the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Clandelino Benitez, a leader of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salceco, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.- As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of a strike at the Ita茂pu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on 12 December 1989, the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions. It also requests to be kept informed of the results of any such inquiry.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901893, response status: 200"

The Committee has always considered that workers should enjoy the right to strike and the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests.

Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures which may be necessary to remedy the situation, and to keep it informed in this connection.(c) As regards the allegation that an enterprise refused to negotiate a collective agreement with its workers, the Committee recalls that in ratifying Convention No. 98, the Government undertook to adopt appropriate measures to promote collective bargaining. It emphasises that employers should, within the framework of collective bargaining, recognise the representative organisations of the workers they employ.(d) As regards the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders for legitimate trade union activities, the Committee recalls that preventive detention implies the risk of a serious interference in the activities of trade unions, and that it must be accompanied by appropriate judicial guarantees implemented within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply detailed information on the current legal status of the following trade union leaders: Efigenio Lisboa, a peasant trade union leader, Clandelino Benitez, a leader of the ""Munich"" brewery trade union, Carlos Filizzola and Silvio Ferreira, CUT trade union leaders, and Pedro Salceco, a leader of the CAPSA, who are alleged to have been arrested or restricted in their freedom of movement.(e) As regards the allegations of the army's violent repression of a strike at the Ita茂pu hydroelectric scheme, which resulted in two deaths and a dozen injuries on 12 December 1989, the Committee urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry so as to clarify the facts, identify and punish the guilty parties, and prevent a repetition of such actions.

The compulsory reinstatement of the dismissed union leader is a matter for the judicial authorities, in accordance with section 3 of Act No. 1172/85.

In this connection, the Committee wishes to inform the Government that the existence of basic legislative provisions prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination is not sufficient unless these provisions are accompanied by effective procedures ensuring their application in practice. Thus, for example, it may often be difficult - if not impossible - for a worker to furnish proof of an act of anti-union discrimination of which he has been the victim. This shows the full importance of Article 3 of Convention No. 98, which provides that machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established, where necessary, to ensure respect for the right to organise. This means that besides preventive machinery to forestall anti-union dismissals (such as, for example, the obtaining of prior authorisation from the labour inspectorate before carrying out the dismissal of a trade union leader), a further means of ensuring effective protection could be to make it compulsory for employers to prove that the motive for their decision to dismiss a worker has no connection with the latter's trade union activities.

According to the Government, the Labour Directorate was awaiting a court decision regarding the legitimacy of one of the two executive committees, for the purpose of registering it. Nevertheless, the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dated back to 1987 and, according to the complainant, it was in that year that the Labour Directorate recognised the other executive committee. The Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour ordered the negotiation of a new collective agreement and specified that the other executive committee was to represent workers in the negotiations. More specifically, as concerns the strike that began during the harvest on 30 August 1989 and was followed by 95 per cent of workers in the CAPSA enterprise, the complainant reports that the strike was suspended at the request of the enterprise on 4 September when the Conciliation and Arbitration Board declared the strike illegal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901712, response status: 200"

It recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that it has stated on numerous occasions that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests.

In response, the Ministry of Education and Culture threatened to dismiss and disqualify teachers participating in such a strike, in violation of Convention No. 87. The text of the communication by the Ministry of Education and Culture was as follows:The Ministry of Education and Culture informs all teachers, heads of households and the population at large that, in response to the concerns expressed by the country's teachers, and in particular to their wish for an overall improvement in their conditions of life, as well as the progress of education in the country, it is working to reach such objectives through the appropriate legal channels.However, at the same time, it reminds the petitioners of the provisions contained in article 55 of the national Constitution, which states that: ""All Paraguyan citizens have the right to hold public office and employment with no conditions other than fitness for the position in question. Public officials and employees are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes, as well as from collectively leaving their posts."" Furthermore, article 123 states that: ""All residents are required to comply with and obey this Constitution and the laws, decrees, resolutions and other provisions which the public authorities may issue in accordance with their mandate.""Likewise, the Ministry recalls the provisions of Act No. 200 on the status of public officials, and in particular the following sections: ""Section 36: Public officials may not adopt collective resolutions against provisions issued by the competent authorities."" ""Section 37: Public officials are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes. For the purposes of this Act, a work stoppage is considered as a collective suspension of services, and a strike as a collective absence from work. Strikes shall also include the collective refusal of public officials, or individual refusals which take place within an interval of ten days by more than five officials in the same unit."" ""Section 38: Public officials who infringe the provisions of the foregoing section will be disqualified from holding public employment for a period of two to five years. Public officials who are found guilty of threatening work stoppages or strikes will be subject to dismissal."" ""Section 39: Public officials are prohibited from using the premises or property of the administration for any purpose other than the performance of their specific tasks.""Thus, given the rule of law, the Ministry warns those concerned that the above-mentioned sanctions and legal provisions will be applied in the event of any transgressions of said provisions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901712, response status: 200"

The secretary of the Organisation, Hilda Montiel de R铆os, has been suspended from the Francisco Solano L贸pez School for having defended the OTEP before the school's students and teachers against accusations made by the school's director. In spite of the fact that these explanations were well received by the students and teachers, on 20 August 1990 the school's director relieved this teacher of her functions accusing her of insubordination and rebellion, and requested the Ministry of Education and Culture to fill the vacancy. According to the allegations, this dismissal is unacceptable, inasmuch as the school's director has neither the authority nor the competence to act in this manner, since such procedures fall to the competence of the Ministry. According to the complainant, this case must be viewed against the background of administrative corruption, warnings and the suspensions of certain members of the OTEP. On 23 August 1990 a delegation composed of teachers from the region, students, heads of households and the attorney for the Organisation's regional branch presented a formal complaint before the Ministry of Education.

Bearing in mind that the authorities' refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dates back to 1987, the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring that legislation will facilitate the expeditious disposition of proceedings involving labour-related matters. Moreover, since the Government has provided no information concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike which, according to the complainants, was followed by 95 per cent of the workers of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. enterprise, the Committee again emphasises that the right to strike constitutes an essential means for workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests, and that limitations on, or the prohibition of strikes may only apply in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (those where an interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). It considers that this definition does not cover this present case.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901712, response status: 200"

Consequently, given the Government's failure to reply, the Committee draws its attention to Article 1 of Convention No. 98, which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"", and emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901712, response status: 200"

In general, on the question of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation on the trade union rights of teachers who are also public officials, the Committee emphasises that workers in the education sector should enjoy the right to establish trade union organisations, to bargain collectively and to resort to strikes (see 226th Report, Case No. 1166 (Honduras), paras. 343 and 344; see also the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 3rd edition, 1985, paras. 394, 404 and 601).

The Committee deplores the Government's lack of co-operation and urges it in the future to submit detailed replies without delay.(b) As regards the proceedings for the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company), and the reinstatement of trade union leaders dismissed since 1987, the Committee again emphasises that the absence of a court ruling over such a long period of time constitutes a denial of justice, and therefore a denial of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the legislation will facilitate labour-related judicial proceedings.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that workers in cotton companies do not provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term, and consequently that their right to strike should not be subject to serious restrictions or prohibitions, either in law or in practice.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees to workers in the education sector the right to establish trade unions, to bargain collectively and to strike.(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to Article 1 of Convention No. 98, which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take measures for the reinstatement of the teacher trade unionist, Mrs. Montiel de R铆os.(f) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the trade unionists of the National Peasants' Union, Messrs.

This transfer was ordered by means of resolution No. 168 of 7 March 1988, which also reclassified Mr. Esp铆nola as an alternate teacher, although he had been a regular teacher for five years. The WCOTP attaches several documents which evidence the prominent trade union activities of this teacher, who participated actively in the National Minimum Wage Campaign launched by the OTEP in 1987. Mr. Esp铆nola appealed the ministerial resolution on 11 March 1988 before the Ministry of Education and Culture, arguing that these measures were unjustified.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901711, response status: 200"

Mrs. Novara was led to the ""Buen Pastor"" penitentiary and charged with subversive activities, under Act No. 208 on the protection of law and order and the freedom of individuals. The WCOTP states that, according to information it has received, Mrs. Novara was subjected to psychological pressure and received threats of sexual abuse during her detention. Mrs. Novara was released on 17 October 1988, but was dismissed from her teaching post.

Moreover, trade unionists should enjoy adequate protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination not only in respect of their hiring and dismissal, but also in respect of any discriminatory measure taken during their employment, and in particular against transfers, delays in promotion and other prejudicial action (in this connection, see 236th Report, Case No. 1290 (Uruguay), para. 389 and 211th Report, Case No. 1020 (Mali), para. 250).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901711, response status: 200"

According to the Government, the Labour Directorate was awaiting a court decision regarding the legitimacy of one of the two executive committees, for the purpose of registering it. Nevertheless, the refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dated back to 1987 and, according to the complainant, it was in that year that the Labour Directorate recognised the other executive committee. The Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour ordered the negotiation of a new collective agreement and specified that the other executive committee was to represent workers in the negotiations. More specifically, as concerns the strike that began during the harvest on 30 August 1989 and was followed by 95 per cent of workers in the CAPSA enterprise, the complainant reports that the strike was suspended at the request of the enterprise on 4 September when the Conciliation and Arbitration Board declared the strike illegal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901679, response status: 200"

In response, the Ministry of Education and Culture threatened to dismiss and disqualify teachers participating in such a strike, in violation of Convention No. 87. The text of the communication by the Ministry of Education and Culture was as follows:The Ministry of Education and Culture informs all teachers, heads of households and the population at large that, in response to the concerns expressed by the country's teachers, and in particular to their wish for an overall improvement in their conditions of life, as well as the progress of education in the country, it is working to reach such objectives through the appropriate legal channels.However, at the same time, it reminds the petitioners of the provisions contained in article 55 of the national Constitution, which states that: ""All Paraguyan citizens have the right to hold public office and employment with no conditions other than fitness for the position in question. Public officials and employees are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes, as well as from collectively leaving their posts."" Furthermore, article 123 states that: ""All residents are required to comply with and obey this Constitution and the laws, decrees, resolutions and other provisions which the public authorities may issue in accordance with their mandate.""Likewise, the Ministry recalls the provisions of Act No. 200 on the status of public officials, and in particular the following sections: ""Section 36: Public officials may not adopt collective resolutions against provisions issued by the competent authorities."" ""Section 37: Public officials are prohibited from engaging in work stoppages and strikes. For the purposes of this Act, a work stoppage is considered as a collective suspension of services, and a strike as a collective absence from work. Strikes shall also include the collective refusal of public officials, or individual refusals which take place within an interval of ten days by more than five officials in the same unit."" ""Section 38: Public officials who infringe the provisions of the foregoing section will be disqualified from holding public employment for a period of two to five years. Public officials who are found guilty of threatening work stoppages or strikes will be subject to dismissal."" ""Section 39: Public officials are prohibited from using the premises or property of the administration for any purpose other than the performance of their specific tasks.""Thus, given the rule of law, the Ministry warns those concerned that the above-mentioned sanctions and legal provisions will be applied in the event of any transgressions of said provisions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901679, response status: 200"

The secretary of the Organisation, Hilda Montiel de R铆os, has been suspended from the Francisco Solano L贸pez School for having defended the OTEP before the school's students and teachers against accusations made by the school's director. In spite of the fact that these explanations were well received by the students and teachers, on 20 August 1990 the school's director relieved this teacher of her functions accusing her of insubordination and rebellion, and requested the Ministry of Education and Culture to fill the vacancy. According to the allegations, this dismissal is unacceptable, inasmuch as the school's director has neither the authority nor the competence to act in this manner, since such procedures fall to the competence of the Ministry. According to the complainant, this case must be viewed against the background of administrative corruption, warnings and the suspensions of certain members of the OTEP. On 23 August 1990 a delegation composed of teachers from the region, students, heads of households and the attorney for the Organisation's regional branch presented a formal complaint before the Ministry of Education.

Bearing in mind that the authorities' refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dates back to 1987, the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring that legislation will facilitate the expeditious disposition of proceedings involving labour-related matters. Moreover, since the Government has provided no information concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike which, according to the complainants, was followed by 95 per cent of the workers of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. enterprise, the Committee again emphasises that the right to strike constitutes an essential means for workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests, and that limitations on, or the prohibition of strikes may only apply in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (those where an interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). It considers that this definition does not cover this present case.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901679, response status: 200"

Consequently, given the Government's failure to reply, the Committee draws its attention to Article 1 of Convention No. 98, which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"", and emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901679, response status: 200"

In general, on the question of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation on the trade union rights of teachers who are also public officials, the Committee emphasises that workers in the education sector should enjoy the right to establish trade union organisations, to bargain collectively and to resort to strikes (see 226th Report, Case No. 1166 (Honduras), paras. 343 and 344; see also the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 3rd edition, 1985, paras. 394, 404 and 601).

The Committee deplores the Government's lack of co-operation and urges it in the future to submit detailed replies without delay.(b) As regards the proceedings for the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company), and the reinstatement of trade union leaders dismissed since 1987, the Committee again emphasises that the absence of a court ruling over such a long period of time constitutes a denial of justice, and therefore a denial of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the legislation will facilitate labour-related judicial proceedings.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that workers in cotton companies do not provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term, and consequently that their right to strike should not be subject to serious restrictions or prohibitions, either in law or in practice.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees to workers in the education sector the right to establish trade unions, to bargain collectively and to strike.(e) The Committee draws the Government's attention to Article 1 of Convention No. 98, which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"". It emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination and requests the Government to take measures for the reinstatement of the teacher trade unionist, Mrs. Montiel de R铆os.(f) Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the trade unionists of the National Peasants' Union, Messrs.

The claims made by the union headed by Pedro Salcedo included a demand that the employers negotiate on the dismissals and suspensions that the company wanted to make and that the latter hold discussions with the union, as well as a demand that the company reinstate the dismissed trade union leaders and refund the trade union contributions that had been deducted by it since February 1987. The strike (which was supported by 95 per cent of the workers of CAPSA) was suspended following an injunction (""recurso de amparo"") applied for by the company and a telegram from the Ministry of Labour requesting that the strike be called off so that a tripartite meeting - Ministry-union-company - could be held within 24 hours. The meeting took place on 1 September 1989 before the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of the Ministry of Labour. At the meeting the company representatives stated that although the problem of recognising one or other executive committee was before the courts, they recommended resolving the issue by the merger of the two committees. According to the complainant, the real executive committee confined itself to presenting the claims which justified the strike, while the representative of the Ministry granted the employers a specified period of time in which to reply. On 4 September, at a further meeting, the company rejected the union's claims. Subsequently the Conciliation and Arbitration Board decided: to declare the strike illegal and to put an end to individual contracts of employment and negotiate a new collective agreement; in these negotiations the workers were represented by the other executive, which is considered by the workers - who gave massive support to the strike - as being set up, influenced and manipulated by the company.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901678, response status: 200"

In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the General Directorate of Labour, in deciding in favour of the group headed by Mr. Ram茅rez and Mr. Melgarejo, has engaged in anti-union interference in violation of Article 3 of Convention No. 87 which stipulates that the public authorities must refrain from any interference that would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.

It observes that the Government cites the specific case of trade union leader Marcelino Coraz贸n Medina, who is active as a leader of workers and peasants, and a member of the Workers' Party.

The Committee wishes to point out that in the event of assaults on a person's physical or moral integrity, it considers that the government concerned should undertake an independent judicial investigation as soon as possible, since this represents an especially appropriate means for clarifying the facts, determining responsibility, punishing the guilty and preventing the repetition of such acts.

The Committee has already had theoccasion to state that the right to strike may indeed be restricted or evenprohibited in the public service (public employees being those who act asagents of the public authorities) or in essential services in the strict senseof the term (i.e. services whose interruption would endanger the life,personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).

In this particular case, the restriction of theright to strike of doctors and nurses in the Clinicas Hospital should beoffset by appropriate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitrationprocedures in which the persons concerned can take part at every stage and inwhich the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented, as theCommittee had the occasion to state in a previous case.

The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October 1983), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901431, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since 1979 for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901431, response status: 200"

While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting 27 workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Am茅rica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901431, response status: 200"

Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).

The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on 21 October) for the same purpose.

These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Coraz贸n Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asunci贸n, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated 15 October 1985, the ICFTU states that Mr. Coraz贸n Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital.

The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October 1983), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since 1979 for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting 27 workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Am茅rica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

The Committee also observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the Director-General and stated the following: (1) they had intended to set up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant; (2) on 18 August 1984, as they were preparing for an assembly which they had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were detained by members of the armed forces; and (3) they had not been brought to trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

Moreover, according to the ministry authorities, the assembly which had been called was unauthorised and therefore could not be held. The organisers of the assembly had consequently been detained by the armed forces. They were later released without having been brought to trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477). Furthermore, in view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days, and that none of the trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee would emphasise the principle that any person who is detained should immediately be brought before the competent court.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that, according to the authorities, the persons concerned do not appear to be actually working in the construction industry.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire on 18 October 1985. Thus, the faction led by Milciades Gim茅nez D铆az called an assembly on 13 October 1984, while the faction led by Lino G贸mez called another for 14 October 1984, although the latter was postponed by the police and was held on 21 October 1984.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

However, when it was informed of the executive committee elected on 21 October 1984 at the assembly led by Lino G贸mez, the competent authority of the Ministry of Justice and Labour notified Lino G贸mez on 21 November 1984 of the text of a decision of the legal consultant's office stating that recognition could not be granted since ""by Resolution No. 1717 dated 17 October of the current year the Labour Directorate registered the National Union of Construction Workers, whose executive committee is currently in office, and its term of office is due to expire in 1987 according to its statutes"". A subsequent decision issued by the legal consultant's office, notified by the Director of Labour on 15 February 1985, stated that an appeal could be lodged through the administrative disputes procedure.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations, told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC. According to the ministry authorities, once Lino G贸mez had been informed of the decision to recognise the executive committee elected on 13 October 1984, he could have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on 21 October) for the same purpose. The Committee would like to point out that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

The Committee requests the Government to alter what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if considered objectively, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901394, response status: 200"

The Committee adjourns its examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced, and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.Case No. 1301(a) The Committee regrets the detention of five trade union leaders and trade unionists of the National Union of Construction Workers.(b) The Committee reiterates the principle that the detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) In view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days and that none of the five trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee stresses the principle that any person who is detained must be brought without delay before the competent court.Case No. 1328(a) The Committee considers that the decision of 17 October 1984 of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee of SINATRAC, elected by the assembly held on 13 October 1984, taken in full awareness that another regularly convened assembly was to be held for the same purpose a few days later on 21 October, constitutes an arbitrary and too speedy decision.(b) The Committee draws attention to the fact that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation, they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.Case No. 1341(a) The Committee requests the Government to change what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if objectively considered, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.(b) The Committee notes that Mr. Marcelino Coraz贸n Medina has been released.

The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October 1983), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since 1979 for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting 27 workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Am茅rica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

The Committee also observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the Director-General and stated the following: (1) they had intended to set up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant; (2) on 18 August 1984, as they were preparing for an assembly which they had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were detained by members of the armed forces; and (3) they had not been brought to trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

Moreover, according to the ministry authorities, the assembly which had been called was unauthorised and therefore could not be held. The organisers of the assembly had consequently been detained by the armed forces. They were later released without having been brought to trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477). Furthermore, in view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days, and that none of the trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee would emphasise the principle that any person who is detained should immediately be brought before the competent court.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that, according to the authorities, the persons concerned do not appear to be actually working in the construction industry.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire on 18 October 1985. Thus, the faction led by Milciades Gim茅nez D铆az called an assembly on 13 October 1984, while the faction led by Lino G贸mez called another for 14 October 1984, although the latter was postponed by the police and was held on 21 October 1984.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

However, when it was informed of the executive committee elected on 21 October 1984 at the assembly led by Lino G贸mez, the competent authority of the Ministry of Justice and Labour notified Lino G贸mez on 21 November 1984 of the text of a decision of the legal consultant's office stating that recognition could not be granted since ""by Resolution No. 1717 dated 17 October of the current year the Labour Directorate registered the National Union of Construction Workers, whose executive committee is currently in office, and its term of office is due to expire in 1987 according to its statutes"". A subsequent decision issued by the legal consultant's office, notified by the Director of Labour on 15 February 1985, stated that an appeal could be lodged through the administrative disputes procedure.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations, told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC. According to the ministry authorities, once Lino G贸mez had been informed of the decision to recognise the executive committee elected on 13 October 1984, he could have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on 21 October) for the same purpose. The Committee would like to point out that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901323, response status: 200"

These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Coraz贸n Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asunci贸n, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated 15 October 1985, the ICFTU states that Mr. Coraz贸n Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about 30 days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebasti谩n Rodr铆guez (Secretary General of the Drivers' Trade Union of ""Asunci贸n-Fernando de la Mora"" Line 21) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues.

The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos. 1204 and 1341.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October 1983), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since 1979 for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting 27 workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Am茅rica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

The Committee also observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the Director-General and stated the following: (1) they had intended to set up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant; (2) on 18 August 1984, as they were preparing for an assembly which they had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were detained by members of the armed forces; and (3) they had not been brought to trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

They were later released without having been brought to trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).

Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire on 18 October 1985. Thus, the faction led by Milciades Gim茅nez D铆az called an assembly on 13 October 1984, while the faction led by Lino G贸mez called another for 14 October 1984, although the latter was postponed by the police and was held on 21 October 1984.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations, told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC. According to the ministry authorities, once Lino G贸mez had been informed of the decision to recognise the executive committee elected on 13 October 1984, he could have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901247, response status: 200"

The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on 21 October) for the same purpose.

The Committee adjourns its examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced, and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.Case No. 1301(a) The Committee regrets the detention of five trade union leaders and trade unionists of the National Union of Construction Workers.(b) The Committee reiterates the principle that the detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) In view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days and that none of the five trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee stresses the principle that any person who is detained must be brought without delay before the competent court.Case No. 1328(a) The Committee considers that the decision of 17 October 1984 of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee of SINATRAC, elected by the assembly held on 13 October 1984, taken in full awareness that another regularly convened assembly was to be held for the same purpose a few days later on 21 October, constitutes an arbitrary and too speedy decision.(b) The Committee draws attention to the fact that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation, they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.Case No. 1341(a) The Committee requests the Government to change what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if objectively considered, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.(b) The Committee notes that Mr. Marcelino Coraz贸n Medina has been released.

The Committee notes that the points of contention were first submitted to the Standing Conciliation and Arbitration Board and then to the Labour Court, which will rule in favour of one of the parties. In this respect, noting that the complainant stated that the authorities in the Bank of Brazil refused to talk with the trade union and used delaying tactics, on which the Government made no comment, the Committee can only express the hope that the Labour Court will shortly decide the points of contention concerning the collective agreement in question. It draws attention to the obligation on both employers and trade unions to bargain in good faith to come to an agreement and stresses that satisfactory labour relations depend primarily on the attitudes of the parties towards each other and on their mutual confidence [see, for example, 139th Report, Case No. 725 (Japan) para. 279].

These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Coraz贸n Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asunci贸n, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights.

The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos. 1204 and 1341.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October 1983), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since 1979 for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting 27 workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Am茅rica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

The Committee also observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the Director-General and stated the following: (1) they had intended to set up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant; (2) on 18 August 1984, as they were preparing for an assembly which they had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were detained by members of the armed forces; and (3) they had not been brought to trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477). Furthermore, in view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days, and that none of the trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee would emphasise the principle that any person who is detained should immediately be brought before the competent court.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that, according to the authorities, the persons concerned do not appear to be actually working in the construction industry.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire on 18 October 1985. Thus, the faction led by Milciades Gim茅nez D铆az called an assembly on 13 October 1984, while the faction led by Lino G贸mez called another for 14 October 1984, although the latter was postponed by the police and was held on 21 October 1984.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

However, when it was informed of the executive committee elected on 21 October 1984 at the assembly led by Lino G贸mez, the competent authority of the Ministry of Justice and Labour notified Lino G贸mez on 21 November 1984 of the text of a decision of the legal consultant's office stating that recognition could not be granted since ""by Resolution No. 1717 dated 17 October of the current year the Labour Directorate registered the National Union of Construction Workers, whose executive committee is currently in office, and its term of office is due to expire in 1987 according to its statutes"". A subsequent decision issued by the legal consultant's office, notified by the Director of Labour on 15 February 1985, stated that an appeal could be lodged through the administrative disputes procedure.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations, told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC. According to the ministry authorities, once Lino G贸mez had been informed of the decision to recognise the executive committee elected on 13 October 1984, he could have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

The Ministry was fully aware that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on 21 October) for the same purpose. The Committee would like to point out that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901022, response status: 200"

The Committee adjourns its examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced, and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.Case No. 1301(a) The Committee regrets the detention of five trade union leaders and trade unionists of the National Union of Construction Workers.(b) The Committee reiterates the principle that the detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) In view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days and that none of the five trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee stresses the principle that any person who is detained must be brought without delay before the competent court.Case No. 1328(a) The Committee considers that the decision of 17 October 1984 of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee of SINATRAC, elected by the assembly held on 13 October 1984, taken in full awareness that another regularly convened assembly was to be held for the same purpose a few days later on 21 October, constitutes an arbitrary and too speedy decision.(b) The Committee draws attention to the fact that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation, they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.Case No. 1341(a) The Committee requests the Government to change what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if objectively considered, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.(b) The Committee notes that Mr. Marcelino Coraz贸n Medina has been released.

The fact remains, however, that Jos茅 Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez at least, after their arrest at the beginning of May 1976, were imprisoned for many months without it being apparent from available information that they had been tried. Moreover, the Government has not indicated the specific acts for which they were imprisoned. Admittedly, the mere fact of carrying on a trade union activity or holding responsibilities in a trade union does not imply any immunity from ordinary penal legislation. However, unless it is duly established in a court of law that they have contravened this legislation, the prolonged detention of trade unionists is liable to appear as a hindrance to the normal operation of a union organisation and as a means of intimidating its militants and even its rank-and-file members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899971, response status: 200"

It mentioned in particular the names of the following leaders, who, it claimed, had been arrested and tortured at the beginning of may 1976:- Emigdio Colman Nu帽ez, General Secretary of the CNTU, arrested with his 12-year old son;- Oscar Vicente Rodas, leader of the urban sector, joiner, arrested with his 16-year old daughter and his 16-year old son;- Julian Flor, Jos茅 Ojeda, Jos茅 Parra, Fretez and other leaders of the peasants' movement.The complainant also mentioned the closing down of the John XXIII People's Institute, founded by the Christian Central of workers - now the CNTU - for the benefit of the country's youth.276.The CLAT also described incidents which had occurred during the same period in the town of Pedro Juan caballero, involving trade union leaders: Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Rol贸n had been arrested and taken to the offices of the government delegation, where they were held for 15 days; Severo Delgado, an active peasants' trade unionist, was wanted by the police, who raided his house; he managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons.

The complainants had reason to believe that he was alive and in custody at a National Guard barracks, and had been subjected to torture. He had never been charged with any offence, nor brought to trial, nor convicted. The WCL's communication of 5 August 1977 referred to the same facts.

The right to associate was recognised in the National Constitution, but its exercise had to be regulated by administrative rules to ensure that no harm was done to the national community. The Government went on to state that the unions cited by the complainants were totally unknown to the Ministry, with which the lawfully recognised organisations were registered. The latter would be justified in complaining to international bodies if it could be proved that their rights were being violated. Statements by illegal organisations of the kind involved in the present case - which had never been recognised, and had moreover never applied for recognition - were pure inventions submitted solely for the purpose of giving a false impression of the real situation in the country, for the furtherance of contemptible interests contrary to the general interests of the nation. At no time, added the Government, had there been any infringement of freedom of association; no genuine trade union leader, now or in the past, had ever been hindered in the performance of his functions. As for the others, the Government stated that it had no knowledge of their whereabouts and refuted the allegations made, claiming that those with a full knowledge of the facts who were active in the labour field, within the framework of the Constitution and the national law, had never mentioned having any difficulties of any kind whatsoever inside or outside their unions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899973, response status: 200"

Jos茅 Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos茅 Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, they were still in Emboscada Prison, awaiting trial in the ordinary courts on charges of contravening Act No. 209 respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom.

In the present instance, the fact that the national organisations of workers cited have not been officially recognised is no justification for the rejection of the allegations - which have moreover been presented by the CLAT and by the WCL - since it is clear from the complaints that these organisations have at least a de facto existence.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899973, response status: 200"

In view of this serious situation, the Directorate of Labour asked the Trade Union of the San Antonio Cold Store for information. The union replied that the previous three strikes had not been authorised by it and that they had been carried out by a decision of the workers and without the knowledge of the union officers. This clear and categorical statement led to the conclusion that the union, having had no part in these serious events, had lost authority over its members, and that it was therefore necessary to take over the union with a view to restoring normal conditions and bringing labour-management relations back to the right channels.

It should also be pointed out that, in accordance with section 356, whenever a strike is declared by a number of workers less than that indicated above, the competent authority shall declare that a state of strike does not exist, and order any workers who have left their employment to report back for work within the next 24 hours, under pain of termination of their contract of employment.

In the present case, the complainants have presented allegations which, in the opinion of the Committee, are sufficiently substantiated to warrant further inquiry. Such detailed allegations against a government should be met by detailed observations by the government concerned, in order to enable the Committee to reach definitive conclusions thereon. The Committee can only regret that, despite repeated requests, no reply on the allegations remaining outstanding has yet been received from the Government, thereby preventing the Committee from reaching conclusions in this case.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898922, response status: 200"

A situation in which prior permission was required for the holding of a trade union meeting, the presence of the police at such meetings and the requirement to furnish copies of the minutes of such meetings would clearly be incompatible with this principle.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898922, response status: 200"

The question would seem to depend in part on how certain of the legal provisions referred to above operate-especially section 9 (f) of Legislative Decree No. 3080 which provides for control or supervision of trade unions by the Department of Labour and for the approval of their Constitutions and rules by the Department in agreement with the Executive Power; in the enactment forwarded there is no indication as to the criteria which have to be applied, for instance, in approving or disapproving the rules of a trade union, which would appear to indicate that approval is a matter within the discretion of the administrative authorities. In this connection the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that the right of organisations to draw up their Constitutions and rules in freedom would appear to be considerably restricted in the case, for example, of countries in which Constitutions and rules must be submitted for previous approval by the authorities, whose power of decision does not appear to be limited by any specific rules.""

The Committee presented an interim report on the remaining allegations-those relating to a police attack on an assembly of workers, to the detention of Mr. Insfr谩n, General Secretary of the Grau Union, and to denial of trade union rights-in respect of which it decided to request the Government to furnish further information.
