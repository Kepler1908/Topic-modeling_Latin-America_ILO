In contrast, the Committee notes that, according to the CTSP, the union in question has engaged in union activities for more than 25 years. In this regard, the Committee wishes to recall that, although the founders of a trade union should comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to impair the free establishment of organizations [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, para. 424]. Lastly, the Committee takes note of the allegations of the CTSP that the union was dissolved after having existed for many years while the conditions of its dissolution have not been stated clearly.

In the absence of other indications from the Government, the Committee considers that sanctions such as these could seriously undermine the exercise of trade union rights. It draws the attention of the Government to the provisions of the Workers鈥?Representatives Recommendation, 1971 (No. 143) in which it is expressly established that workers鈥?representatives should enjoy effective protection against any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their status or activities as workers鈥?representatives or on union membership, or participation in union activities in so far as they act in conformity with existing laws or collective agreements or other jointly agreed arrangements. The Committee also notes the communication of the Office of the Ombudsperson, addressed to the Directorate-General of the Post Office in December 2015, which refers to promises to 鈥渞egularize鈥?the workers concerned and recommends that the Directorate-General should respect its commitments with regard to those concerned. Lastly, the Committee notes that according to article 140 of the Decree of 17 May 2005 amending the general civil service regulations, staff may be automatically laid off as a disciplinary measure for a period not exceeding three months. Under these circumstances, the Committee calls on the Government to expedite an independent inquiry into the allegations concerning the automatic laying off of the union representatives concerned, namely Messrs Daniel Dantes, Fely Desire, Jean Estima Fils, Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Ronald Joseph, Harold Colson Lazarre, Amos Musac and Guito Phadael, and to provide information on their present situation. If it is found that acts of anti-union discrimination have been committed by the Directorate-General of the Post Office, the Committee calls on the Government to take the necessary measures of redress, including ensuring that the workers concerned are reinstated without loss of pay.

In this regard, the Committee recalls that the entry by police or military forces into trade union premises without a judicial warrant constitutes a serious and unjustifiable interference in trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, 1996, para. 176]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that, in the future, searches carried out on trade union premises do not take place without the provision of an appropriate judicial warrant, and that they are restricted to the purposes which are the reason for the provision of the warrant.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2908475, response status: 200"

In regard to this, the Committee is compelled to recall that measures that deprive trade union leaders and members of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., para. 74]. While noting that all of the trade unionists involved in this complaint have now been freed, the Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that, in future, no trade unionists are arrested or detained without benefiting from normal judicial proceedings and having the right to due process, and in particular, the right to be informed of the charges brought against them, to communicate freely with counsel of their own choosing, and to a prompt trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2908475, response status: 200"

The Committee is compelled to recall in this respect that, as regards allegations of the physical ill-treatment of trade unionists, governments should give the necessary instructions so as to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and apply effective sanctions where cases of such treatment are found. It has also emphasized the importance that should be attached to the principle laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights according to which all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect of the inherent dignity of the human person [see Digest, op. cit., para. 59].

This draft agreement included, specifically, a wage adjustment of 82 per cent, and the establishment of a vocational training plan, an insurance plan for teachers and a commission for trade union matters. According to the complainant organization, the Government paid only 50 per cent of the wage adjustment and did not respect any of the other points of the agreement. Faced with a government refusal to enter into negotiations again, the CNEH threatened to carry out periodic strikes. Following a general strike in January 1999, an agreement was signed on 4 February 1999 by the Minister of National Education and the CNEH specifying full implementation of the draft agreement of February 1997.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905682, response status: 200"

Finally, the CNEH and the Ministry of National Education came to an agreement in May 1999. However, once again, the complainant organization states that when school started again in September 1999 the Government had still not fulfilled the terms of the agreement. Therefore, on 23 September 1999 the CNEH gave notice of strike action in a letter to the Government for 4 October 1999 onwards unless the Government fulfilled its commitments as laid down in the agreements. The strike began on the date specified.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905682, response status: 200"

However, on 23 October 1999, the Prime Minister stated on the radio that disciplinary measures would be carried out against those teachers on strike. He made no mention of the mediation. Subsequently, on 28 October 1999, 11 teachers, including three regional and national trade union officials of CNEH, were suspended without pay for serious reasons. The CNEH adds that on 16 October a representative of the Ministry had invited the teachers, during a public meeting, to return to work unconditionally. Roussan Coffy, Herv茅 Alix and Andr茅anne Roy, the three members of CNEH who were disciplined, requested the representative to negotiate with the trade unions and not with the teachers. The complainant organization claims that a number of attempts were made by the Ministry of National Education to negotiate directly with the teachers in order to sideline the trade unions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905682, response status: 200"

Furthermore, it maintains that other types of reprisals were carried out by the Government, in particular hiring, under contract, non-teachers to fill the positions of the teaching staff on strike.

The complainant organization also indicates that, following negotiations with the Ministry of National Education in January 2000, Messrs. Coffy and Alix were reinstated in their respective posts.

Regarding the allegations of disciplinary measures taken against teachers following the strike that took place in October 1999, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, 11 teachers, three of whom were trade union officials of CNEH, were suspended without pay for serious reasons one month following the start of the strike. The Committee notes the CNEH declaration that, since January 2000, only one of the trade union officials has been reinstated in his post while a second has been unjustly transferred and the third, Ms. Roy, has still not been reinstated. No information has been received regarding the outcome of the situation for the eight other teachers. In this regard, the Committee recalls that it has always recognized the right to strike by workers and their organizations as a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interests. Furthermore, no one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out a legitimate strike [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, 1996, paras. 474 and 590]. In this particular case and according to the information available in the file, there is nothing to indicate that the strike organized by the teachers after long and fruitless negotiations with the Government was illegal, since Haitian legislation grants teachers the right to strike and prior notice of the strike had been lodged. The Committee emphasizes that respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that workers should not be dismissed or refused re-employment on account of their having participated in a strike or other industrial action. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to ensure the immediate reinstatement in their respective posts of all the teachers, including the trade union officials of CNEH, who were disciplined following their participation in the October 1999 strike. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905682, response status: 200"

In these circumstances, this measure cannot be considered as disciplinary action in response to the strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905682, response status: 200"

As the teaching sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term, the Committee requests the Government to refrain from hiring non-teachers to replace teachers on strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905682, response status: 200"

The Committee once again emphasizes the importance it attaches to the respect of the Resolution concerning the Independence of the Trade Union Movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 35th Session (1952). Recalling that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the formal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party [see Digest, op. cit., para. 451], the Committee urges the Government to refrain from interfering in the creation of a trade union, or from showing favouritism towards, or discrimination against, any given trade union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905682, response status: 200"

Thus it recalls that the rights of workers鈥?organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of those organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, 1996, para. 47]. The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary measures to ensure that this principle is respected in future, in particular by instigating independent judicial inquiries with a view to establishing the facts, punishing those responsible and preventing recurrences.

From 1987-88 onwards, the existing trade union had undertaken a ""clean-up"" campaign against waste, non-payment of invoices by well-to-do individuals close to the Government and by some companies, and various other practices generally referred to as ""non-technical losses"", and had also sought improvements in working conditions. Throughout those years, the union faced constant difficulties in its activities; several of its members suffered harassment or arbitrary imprisonment, others were murdered, particularly during the coup d'茅tat in September 1991. Several members of the union were forced into exile to save their own lives. The return of President Aristide in 1994 coincided with the launch of a neo-liberal economic policy of privatizing state-owned enterprises, and the EDH was at the top of the list of companies to be privatized. FESTRED'H opposed this policy from the beginning and put forward alternatives. The situation deteriorated, as the existence of an active mobilizing trade union became intolerable for the company and for the political authorities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905531, response status: 200"

The management also launched a defamation campaign against a number of trade union leaders and made a number of accusations against the union, none of which were proven. An altercation in October 1996 between two EDH employees led to the dismissal in November 1996 of 30 trade union leaders and more than 400 union members, on the pretext of administrative requirements and allegations of sabotage; however, no formal accusations were made against anyone. Faced with the impossibility of establishing any dialogue with the management, FESTRED'H went through all the avenues of appeal available at national level (Labour Directorate; Ministry of Social Affairs; Tripartite Consultation and Arbitration Committee; Ministry of Public Works; Ministry of Transport and Communications), but to no avail. On 18 October 1996, armed individuals closed the union's offices and all gatherings of union members were prohibited within the enterprise. In December 1996, a representative of the F茅d茅ration des travailleurs du Qu茅bec, who had been asked by the ICFTU to act as an ""honest broker"", held a number of meetings with various representatives of the authorities in order to resolve the dispute, still to no avail, although a representative of the authorities acknowledged that the situation had to be remedied and said that appropriate measures would be taken.

The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary measures to ensure that this principle is respected in future, in particular by instigating independent judicial inquiries with a view to establishing the facts, punishing those responsible and preventing recurrences.

The Committee cannot but point out here that the persons concerned were dismissed immediately after the establishment of the union had been announced to the employer. In the Committee's opinion, there is consequently a strong presumption that the dismissals in question took place on account of activities connected with the setting up of a trade union. Under these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an independent inquiry is immediately carried out on this matter. Should the outcome of this inquiry confirm the anti-union nature of the dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures for the two leaders to be reinstated in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. As regards the other acts of intimidation to which several workers of the company are said to have been subjected, the Committee asks the Government to investigate the matter and reminds it that it is responsible for preventing any acts of anti-union discrimination, and that the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed [see Digest, op. cit., para. 739].

According to the ICFTU, hundreds of people, including many trade unionists, were murdered or disappeared following the coup d'茅tat. Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed. The few trade union offices which stayed open were only able to do so because they remained extremely discreet. All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902700, response status: 200"

These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On 20 October 1991, Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation's premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on 30 September 1991 and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November 1991, army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin's remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr茅 Fran莽ois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation's headquarters have been closed.- On 5 November 1991 soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On 2 January 1992, Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on 6 January 1992 as a consequence of this torture.- On 20 March 1992, Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On 13 March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On 20 May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On 25 May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women's branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of 27 May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July 1992 in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists' union, AJH. The union was dismantled through acts of harassment and intimidation committed against its leaders, and the new pro-military leaders condemned the legitimate leaders in speeches made on the radio.- The Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH) was particularly singled out by the army. Its members were harassed, threatened and dismissed. One of its members was murdered. Jean Delince Josma, a member of the FESTREDH, was reportedly murdered by the army in October. Shortly after the coup d'茅tat of September, the army broke into buildings of the National Electric Company, threatening and harassing members of the FESTREDH. The director of the company, who had just been named, refused to follow the army's orders to dismiss the trade union leaders, and was dismissed himself. Subsequently, 23 members of the FESTREDH were dismissed in mid-December 1991. On 14 December 1991, two trade union leaders of the FESTREDH, Abel Pointdujour and Evans Saintune, were arrested when they tried to negotiate compensation for the company's workers who had been dismissed after the coup d'茅tat. They were only released three days later, after having been interrogated about their supposed political links and been advised that they should, in the interest of their own safety, leave the country. During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum. The General Secretary went into hiding after having discovered that his name was on a list of trade union leaders and leaders of grass-roots organizations sought by the army. A jeep belonging to the trade union and used by trade union leaders to maintain contact with their members in the countryside was destroyed by the army.- In January, two other leaders of the FESTREDH were arrested and harassed by the army. Delamain Ambroise and Raynald Garnier were abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention. They were subsequently released and dismissed from their jobs. On 1 April 1992, several members of the executive and two trade union representatives, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were severely beaten by the army. From the month of September on, all the members of the executive and the FESTREDH were dismissed because of their trade union activities.- Farmers' trade unions have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment from the military. On 5 May 1992, Jacques Joseph, the President of the CLAM, a farmers' trade union affiliated with the OGITH, and his wife were arrested and severely beaten. They were accused of leading a demonstration calling for the return of President Aristide. They were later released.- At the beginning of May, Daniel Pierre, the President of the UDTL, a trade union of farmers in Boukan Michel which is affiliated with the OGITH, was detained by the section chief, Yvon Verdieu. Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On 5 May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to hold trade union meetings. The trade union leaders did not meet any more, as they feared for their safety.- The harassment of trade unions spread to a number of enterprises under the protection of the army in the private sector. On 11 and 12 May, 15 trade union leaders were dismissed from ""Home of Champions"", a US enterprise which produces baseballs and which is located in Cit茅 Soleil. One month later, four other trade union leaders were also dismissed by the enterprise. When the director of the enterprise called the trade union leaders into his office to inform them of their dismissal, he stated that ""this is not the right time to be a trade unionist"".- The trade union leaders employed by three other US enterprises were also dismissed. They too reported anti-trade union statements made by management. Nine trade unionists were dismissed from the ""Michico"" enterprise which produces textile products, and eight from the ""Chancerelles Manufacturing"" enterprise which produces women's lingerie.- The management of the US ""Automatic Accusonic"" enterprise had a different but just as effective approach to destroying the enterprise's trade union. The factory was temporarily closed, and when it reopened it was declared a ""union-free"" company. None of the trade union leaders or trade unionists were re-employed. When the President of the trade union asked for them to be reinstated, he was severely beaten and his arm was broken.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902700, response status: 200"

Its occupational organizations, and particularly the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA), the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, the National Federation of Industrial Workers and Subcontractors (FENATIS), and the Association of Newspaper Workers (ATPGA), are regularly hindered from exercising their trade union activities. Many of their members have been arrested or tortured, or have disappeared. Namely, there have been the following cases:- On 23 October 1992, Pierre Andr茅 Mertyl was tortured. There has still been no response to the complaint filed by the lawyers of the CTH (Confederation of Haitian Workers).- On 20 December 1992, Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm in J茅r茅mie, was tortured for no reason by Joseph Jean-Fran莽ois, a corporal in the army, and by Kesnel Guerrier.- On 6 January 1993, Baselet Derival, a member of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, was arrested, imprisoned and tortured. He was held at the Faustin Soulouque barracks in Petit-Goave.- Pierre Trechelet, the brother of a member of the Executive Committee of the CTH, has been reported missing.- On 18 January 1993, Raynold Belizaire, a member of the FENATIS, was shot twice while he was in his private home.- On 22 January 1993, Estimable Jean-Emile, a correspondent of Radio Cacique and a member of the Democratic Youth Movement (affiliated with the Young Farmers' Association of P茅lagie-AJPL, which is an association under the FENATAPA) was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Mr. G茅l猫s, the head of the third section of Marchand Dessalines.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902700, response status: 200"

Indeed, on 24 January 1993, the head of the fifth communal section of St. Marc (Tibordet - Antibonite region), prohibited a FENATAPA meeting which was to be chaired by Ars猫ne Lebrun, the General Secretary of the Organization.

This national trade union organization also reiterates the information according to which these dismissals followed the dismissal of 22 members of the SOETRATEC singled out by name, including the members of the trade unions' executive, as early as 13 November 1991, under the pretext that the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CANEP) did not have any more money to pay them. The complainant organization explains that under President Aristide, the SOETRATEC held regular trade union meetings to deal with workers' problems and union affairs, and the members of this union had taken trade union training courses. The complainant organization points out that on 31 March 1993 the SOETRATEC sent a letter to the director of the labour service of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but that nothing was done in response to this letter.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902700, response status: 200"

Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed.

These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On 20 October 1991, Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation's premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on 30 September 1991 and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November 1991, army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin's remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr茅 Fran莽ois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation's headquarters have been closed.- On 5 November 1991 soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On 2 January 1992, Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on 6 January 1992 as a consequence of this torture.- On 20 March 1992, Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On 13 March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On 20 May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On 25 May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women's branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of 27 May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July 1992 in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists' union, AJH. The union was dismantled through acts of harassment and intimidation committed against its leaders, and the new pro-military leaders condemned the legitimate leaders in speeches made on the radio.- The Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH) was particularly singled out by the army. Its members were harassed, threatened and dismissed. One of its members was murdered. Jean Delince Josma, a member of the FESTREDH, was reportedly murdered by the army in October. Shortly after the coup d'茅tat of September, the army broke into buildings of the National Electric Company, threatening and harassing members of the FESTREDH. The director of the company, who had just been named, refused to follow the army's orders to dismiss the trade union leaders, and was dismissed himself. Subsequently, 23 members of the FESTREDH were dismissed in mid-December 1991. On 14 December 1991, two trade union leaders of the FESTREDH, Abel Pointdujour and Evans Saintune, were arrested when they tried to negotiate compensation for the company's workers who had been dismissed after the coup d'茅tat. They were only released three days later, after having been interrogated about their supposed political links and been advised that they should, in the interest of their own safety, leave the country. During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum. The General Secretary went into hiding after having discovered that his name was on a list of trade union leaders and leaders of grass-roots organizations sought by the army. A jeep belonging to the trade union and used by trade union leaders to maintain contact with their members in the countryside was destroyed by the army.- In January, two other leaders of the FESTREDH were arrested and harassed by the army. Delamain Ambroise and Raynald Garnier were abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention. They were subsequently released and dismissed from their jobs. On 1 April 1992, several members of the executive and two trade union representatives, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were severely beaten by the army. From the month of September on, all the members of the executive and the FESTREDH were dismissed because of their trade union activities.- Farmers' trade unions have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment from the military. On 5 May 1992, Jacques Joseph, the President of the CLAM, a farmers' trade union affiliated with the OGITH, and his wife were arrested and severely beaten. They were accused of leading a demonstration calling for the return of President Aristide. They were later released.- At the beginning of May, Daniel Pierre, the President of the UDTL, a trade union of farmers in Boukan Michel which is affiliated with the OGITH, was detained by the section chief, Yvon Verdieu. Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On 5 May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to hold trade union meetings. The trade union leaders did not meet any more, as they feared for their safety.- The harassment of trade unions spread to a number of enterprises under the protection of the army in the private sector. On 11 and 12 May, 15 trade union leaders were dismissed from ""Home of Champions"", a US enterprise which produces baseballs and which is located in Cit茅 Soleil. One month later, four other trade union leaders were also dismissed by the enterprise. When the director of the enterprise called the trade union leaders into his office to inform them of their dismissal, he stated that ""this is not the right time to be a trade unionist"".- The trade union leaders employed by three other US enterprises were also dismissed. They too reported anti-trade union statements made by management. Nine trade unionists were dismissed from the ""Michico"" enterprise which produces textile products, and eight from the ""Chancerelles Manufacturing"" enterprise which produces women's lingerie.- The management of the US ""Automatic Accusonic"" enterprise had a different but just as effective approach to destroying the enterprise's trade union. The factory was temporarily closed, and when it reopened it was declared a ""union-free"" company. None of the trade union leaders or trade unionists were re-employed. When the President of the trade union asked for them to be reinstated, he was severely beaten and his arm was broken.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

On 15 November 1991 the members of the executive of this trade union had already been dismissed. Finally, on 17 March 1993, Joseph Michelet, a member of the trade union of workers of Larco Fr猫res SA, a union affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested, subjected to intensive interrogation on the Haitian crisis, and then released.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

Its occupational organizations, and particularly the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA), the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, the National Federation of Industrial Workers and Subcontractors (FENATIS), and the Association of Newspaper Workers (ATPGA), are regularly hindered from exercising their trade union activities. Many of their members have been arrested or tortured, or have disappeared. Namely, there have been the following cases:- On 23 October 1992, Pierre Andr茅 Mertyl was tortured. There has still been no response to the complaint filed by the lawyers of the CTH (Confederation of Haitian Workers).- On 20 December 1992, Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm in J茅r茅mie, was tortured for no reason by Joseph Jean-Fran莽ois, a corporal in the army, and by Kesnel Guerrier.- On 6 January 1993, Baselet Derival, a member of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, was arrested, imprisoned and tortured. He was held at the Faustin Soulouque barracks in Petit-Goave.- Pierre Trechelet, the brother of a member of the Executive Committee of the CTH, has been reported missing.- On 18 January 1993, Raynold Belizaire, a member of the FENATIS, was shot twice while he was in his private home.- On 22 January 1993, Estimable Jean-Emile, a correspondent of Radio Cacique and a member of the Democratic Youth Movement (affiliated with the Young Farmers' Association of P茅lagie-AJPL, which is an association under the FENATAPA) was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Mr. G茅l猫s, the head of the third section of Marchand Dessalines.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

Indeed, on 24 January 1993, the head of the fifth communal section of St. Marc (Tibordet - Antibonite region), prohibited a FENATAPA meeting which was to be chaired by Ars猫ne Lebrun, the General Secretary of the Organization. The request for authorization was rejected by the authorities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

On 26 January 1993, Jean Elder Almeus, a member of the ATPGA (Newspaper Workers' Association of Grand'Anse), was arrested while he participated in the ""Truth on the Drum"" programme broadcast by Radio Vision.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

This national trade union organization also reiterates the information according to which these dismissals followed the dismissal of 22 members of the SOETRATEC singled out by name, including the members of the trade unions' executive, as early as 13 November 1991, under the pretext that the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CANEP) did not have any more money to pay them. The complainant organization explains that under President Aristide, the SOETRATEC held regular trade union meetings to deal with workers' problems and union affairs, and the members of this union had taken trade union training courses. The complainant organization points out that on 31 March 1993 the SOETRATEC sent a letter to the director of the labour service of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but that nothing was done in response to this letter.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

This attack reportedly led to the death of his two children and seriously injured a third child. CLAT adds that this union leader and six of his collaborators were reportedly arrested while organizing a seminar in J茅r茅mie. Furthermore, the Deputy Secretary-General of the CTH, Louis Octave Dorvilier, was reportedly held by four armed individuals; he was abducted into a van blindfolded, kicked, tortured and then abandoned. The General-Secretary himself, Jean-Claude Lebrun, was reportedly threatened. Finally, three members of an organization in Marceline (Cap Perin South), Gerthin Augustin, Gabriel Louine and Romain Castra were abducted into a van, license number 8513, on a road in P茅tion Villi; their whereabouts are as yet unknown.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

Even in the absence of a reply on the substance of the case from the present democratic Government, which cannot be held responsible for these acts, the Committee has to determine which principles of freedom of association are at stake in these affairs so as to make it possible for the Government which has been restored to its prerogatives and functions in Haiti to redress these violations. Considering the scope of the issues involved, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902669, response status: 200"

Indeed, instructions should be given so that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and effective sanctions should be applied where cases of ill-treatment are found. (See Digest, op. cit., paras. 80 and 84.)

These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On 20 October 1991, Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation's premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on 30 September 1991 and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November 1991, army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin's remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr茅 Fran莽ois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation's headquarters have been closed.- On 5 November 1991 soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On 2 January 1992, Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on 6 January 1992 as a consequence of this torture.- On 20 March 1992, Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On 13 March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On 20 May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On 25 May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women's branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of 27 May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July 1992 in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists' union, AJH. The union was dismantled through acts of harassment and intimidation committed against its leaders, and the new pro-military leaders condemned the legitimate leaders in speeches made on the radio.- The Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH) was particularly singled out by the army. Its members were harassed, threatened and dismissed. One of its members was murdered. Jean Delince Josma, a member of the FESTREDH, was reportedly murdered by the army in October. Shortly after the coup d'茅tat of September, the army broke into buildings of the National Electric Company, threatening and harassing members of the FESTREDH. The director of the company, who had just been named, refused to follow the army's orders to dismiss the trade union leaders, and was dismissed himself. Subsequently, 23 members of the FESTREDH were dismissed in mid-December 1991. On 14 December 1991, two trade union leaders of the FESTREDH, Abel Pointdujour and Evans Saintune, were arrested when they tried to negotiate compensation for the company's workers who had been dismissed after the coup d'茅tat. They were only released three days later, after having been interrogated about their supposed political links and been advised that they should, in the interest of their own safety, leave the country. During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum. The General Secretary went into hiding after having discovered that his name was on a list of trade union leaders and leaders of grass-roots organizations sought by the army. A jeep belonging to the trade union and used by trade union leaders to maintain contact with their members in the countryside was destroyed by the army.- In January, two other leaders of the FESTREDH were arrested and harassed by the army. Delamain Ambroise and Raynald Garnier were abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention. They were subsequently released and dismissed from their jobs. On 1 April 1992, several members of the executive and two trade union representatives, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were severely beaten by the army. From the month of September on, all the members of the executive and the FESTREDH were dismissed because of their trade union activities.- Farmers' trade unions have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment from the military. On 5 May 1992, Jacques Joseph, the President of the CLAM, a farmers' trade union affiliated with the OGITH, and his wife were arrested and severely beaten. They were accused of leading a demonstration calling for the return of President Aristide. They were later released.- At the beginning of May, Daniel Pierre, the President of the UDTL, a trade union of farmers in Boukan Michel which is affiliated with the OGITH, was detained by the section chief, Yvon Verdieu. Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On 5 May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to hold trade union meetings. The trade union leaders did not meet any more, as they feared for their safety.- The harassment of trade unions spread to a number of enterprises under the protection of the army in the private sector. On 11 and 12 May, 15 trade union leaders were dismissed from ""Home of Champions"", a US enterprise which produces baseballs and which is located in Cit茅 Soleil. One month later, four other trade union leaders were also dismissed by the enterprise. When the director of the enterprise called the trade union leaders into his office to inform them of their dismissal, he stated that ""this is not the right time to be a trade unionist"".- The trade union leaders employed by three other US enterprises were also dismissed. They too reported anti-trade union statements made by management. Nine trade unionists were dismissed from the ""Michico"" enterprise which produces textile products, and eight from the ""Chancerelles Manufacturing"" enterprise which produces women's lingerie.- The management of the US ""Automatic Accusonic"" enterprise had a different but just as effective approach to destroying the enterprise's trade union. The factory was temporarily closed, and when it reopened it was declared a ""union-free"" company. None of the trade union leaders or trade unionists were re-employed. When the President of the trade union asked for them to be reinstated, he was severely beaten and his arm was broken.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902515, response status: 200"

On 15 November 1991 the members of the executive of this trade union had already been dismissed. Finally, on 17 March 1993, Joseph Michelet, a member of the trade union of workers of Larco Fr猫res SA, a union affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested, subjected to intensive interrogation on the Haitian crisis, and then released.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902515, response status: 200"

Its occupational organizations, and particularly the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA), the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, the National Federation of Industrial Workers and Subcontractors (FENATIS), and the Association of Newspaper Workers (ATPGA), are regularly hindered from exercising their trade union activities. Many of their members have been arrested or tortured, or have disappeared. Namely, there have been the following cases:- On 23 October 1992, Pierre Andr茅 Mertyl was tortured. There has still been no response to the complaint filed by the lawyers of the CTH (Confederation of Haitian Workers).- On 20 December 1992, Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm in J茅r茅mie, was tortured for no reason by Joseph Jean-Fran莽ois, a corporal in the army, and by Kesnel Guerrier.- On 6 January 1993, Baselet Derival, a member of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, was arrested, imprisoned and tortured. He was held at the Faustin Soulouque barracks in Petit-Goave.- Pierre Trechelet, the brother of a member of the Executive Committee of the CTH, has been reported missing.- On 18 January 1993, Raynold Belizaire, a member of the FENATIS, was shot twice while he was in his private home.- On 22 January 1993, Estimable Jean-Emile, a correspondent of Radio Cacique and a member of the Democratic Youth Movement (affiliated with the Young Farmers' Association of P茅lagie-AJPL, which is an association under the FENATAPA) was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Mr. G茅l猫s, the head of the third section of Marchand Dessalines.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902515, response status: 200"

Indeed, on 24 January 1993, the head of the fifth communal section of St. Marc (Tibordet - Antibonite region), prohibited a FENATAPA meeting which was to be chaired by Ars猫ne Lebrun, the General Secretary of the Organization. The request for authorization was rejected by the authorities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902515, response status: 200"

On 26 January 1993, Jean Elder Almeus, a member of the ATPGA (Newspaper Workers' Association of Grand'Anse), was arrested while he participated in the ""Truth on the Drum"" programme broadcast by Radio Vision.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902515, response status: 200"

This national trade union organization also reiterates the information according to which these dismissals followed the dismissal of 22 members of the SOETRATEC singled out by name, including the members of the trade unions' executive, as early as 13 November 1991, under the pretext that the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CANEP) did not have any more money to pay them. The complainant organization explains that under President Aristide, the SOETRATEC held regular trade union meetings to deal with workers' problems and union affairs, and the members of this union had taken trade union training courses. The complainant organization points out that on 31 March 1993 the SOETRATEC sent a letter to the director of the labour service of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but that nothing was done in response to this letter.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902515, response status: 200"

This attack reportedly led to the death of his two children and seriously injured a third child. CLAT adds that this union leader and six of his collaborators were reportedly arrested while organizing a seminar in J茅r茅mie. Furthermore, the Deputy Secretary-General of the CTH, Louis Octave Dorvilier, was reportedly held by four armed individuals; he was abducted into a van blindfolded, kicked, tortured and then abandoned. The General-Secretary himself, Jean-Claude Lebrun, was reportedly threatened.

Even in the absence of a reply on the substance of the case from the present democratic Government, which cannot be held responsible for these acts, the Committee has to determine which principles of freedom of association are at stake in these affairs so as to make it possible for the Government which has been restored to its prerogatives and functions in Haiti to redress these violations.

The CLAT alleges that the Ministry of Labour has still not approved legal recognition of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers of Haiti (FENATAPA), which has been pending since the previous year and which was promised by the Minister in November 1986. The complainant organisation also refers to the dismissal of nearly all of its staff, and, in particular, of trade union officials and members by the ""Jebsa"" and ""Performance Footwear"" undertakings. In the case of the ""Jebsa"" enterprise, according to the CLAT, glaring injustices have taken place, and the workers demand that the lock-out be lifted in the enterprise and that the conditions of work and remuneration established by Haitian law be observed. The ""Performance Footwear"" enterprise, for its part, announced the closure of the premises it occupies, changed its name and took up activities in other premises under the name of another representative. In the CLAT's view, this measure not only runs counter to the legislation, but is aimed at destroying the trade union, which represents 80 per cent of the staff. The enterprise refused to take part in any dialogue, and the Ministry of Labour failed to take appropriate measures to seek solutions. According to the CLAT, these two situations are merely an example of what has become a habitual practice of Haitian employers, in glaring contradiction to the efforts being made to build and consolidate a genuinely democratic regime.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901562, response status: 200"

It also recalls that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions (See 211th Report, Case No. 1033 (Jamaica), para. 303 and Case No. 1063 (Costa Rica), para. 616.).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901562, response status: 200"

Indeed, it is stated in the resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 54th Session (1970), that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901562, response status: 200"

The Committee therefore urges the Government to take the measures necessary so that the authorities concerned receive instructions to ensure respect for the law in this regard and to ensure that the union money allegedly taken away during the army attack be returned to the CATH.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901562, response status: 200"

It asks it in particular to endeavour to bring about the reinstatement of the many workers dismissed for having wanted to conduct legitimate trade union activities, and to indicate whether judicial inquiries have been instigated into the ill-treatment inflicted on the imprisoned trade unionists, the occupation of the CATH premises and the confiscations carried out on the premises in question.

The Government adds that the activities held against the few persons who had formed the Confederation in question, without legal status, were subversive activities and that those persons threatened the internal security of the State. Consequently, the action taken against Mr. Yves Richard, allegedly Secretary-General of the CATH, could not have been taken because of his trade union activities or in violation of the legal provisions governing the operation of trade union organisations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900490, response status: 200"

An employment contract may be terminated on grounds of participation in an illegal strike without entailing any liability for the employer and without prejudice to the penalties that may be taken by the public authorities against the strikers. The dismissals in the other two enterprises, of 3 and 6 workers respectively, were due to fluctuations in production and administrative reasons warranting application of the provisions of the Code. Most of the dismissed workers in this case freely accepted the severance pay owing to them. The Government concludes that those who chose instead to bring a lawsuit for unfair termination of their contracts subsequently waived the action initiated and accepted the legal benefits owing to them.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900490, response status: 200"

In the case in question, the Committee considers that the fact that a workers' organisation has not registered its by-laws, as may be required by national law, is not sufficient reason to make its Complaint irreceivable since the principles of freedom of association demand precisely that workers shall be enabled, without previous authorisation, to establish organisations of their own choosing.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900490, response status: 200"

Under this legislation, labour disputes may be settled by compulsory arbitration by the Higher Arbitration Board. The Committee has always regarded the right to strike as one of the essential means for protecting the economic interests of workers. The Committee has nevertheless acknowledged that this right may be restricted, and even prohibited, in certain essential services when a strike in those sectors might have highly prejudicial effects for the national community. However, it has held that this principle might well become meaningless if it were so interpreted as to permit prohibition of a strike in an undertaken not providing an essential service in the strict sense of the term, i.e. a service whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population.

The Committee would recall that, in the past, it has expressed its view with regard to the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, might, nevertheless, affect the exercise of such rights. In the present case, it is important to point out that measures of preventive detention may involve a serious interference with trade union activities which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious situation or emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period; especially where there are allegations of ill-treatment of detainees, the Committee has stressed the importance of carrying out an inquiry into the facts in order to establish responsibilities and of taking appropriate action, in particular, to give precise instructions and apply effective sanctions so as to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900491, response status: 200"

Nevertheless it considers it important to recall that the occupation of trade union premises and the freeze of union bank accounts may constitute a serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities, as it has stated in the past, and consequently may run counter to the principle that trade unions have the right to organise their activities and to the legal exercise thereof without hindrance by the public authorities. Furthermore, the International Labour conference, in its 1970 Resolution concerning Trade Union Rights and their Relation to Civil Liberties, placed special emphasis on the right to protection of trade union property. The Committee would appreciate receiving any observations that the Government might wish to make in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900491, response status: 200"

Inquiries undertaken to clarify the situation have proved fruitless. R茅my Alexis worked at Port-au-Prince.

In a later communication dated 2 December 1959, the complainants, while maintaining reservations as to the restrictions stated to be imposed on trade unions in Haiti, declare that they have had news of the liberation of Mr. Leblanc and indicate that, as the facts complained of no longer subsist, their complaint has now become purposeless.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898399, response status: 200"

In Case No. 66 relating to Greece, the Committee expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not, however, in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. The Committee considered in that case, having regard to conclusions adopted earlier by the Governing Body, that it is free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence. The Committee observed that cases might exist in which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it would be a result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898399, response status: 200"

However, in cases in which it has had before it complaints of alleged infringements of freedom of association under a state of siege or emergency or by virtue of national security legislation, the Committee, while indicating that it is not called upon to comment on the necessity for or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political consideration, has always taken the view that it must consider what repercussions the legislation might have on trade union rights.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"

But, observed the Committee, it appeared from the other information in its possession that Mr. Michel was in prison at the time of such dismissal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"

The Government replied by a communication dated 23 June 1960.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"

If so requested by the employee, the director of the prison shall issue the necessary certificates in evidence of the facts mentioned in this article.The Government declares that Mr. Michel, contrary to this section of the Act, did not inform his chief of his imprisonment, which is why the General Directorate of National Education applied the disciplinary measure prescribed by section 21 of the Act of 19 September 1952.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"

However this may be, it would not seem to be established that the measures complained against resulted from his trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"

Only if these were ordered by reason of the trade union activities properly so called of the arrested persons had a violation of freedom of association occurred.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"

The Committee considers that, although the question of proof must be judged in each case according to the particular circumstances, a complaint which is based solely on statements by the person directly concerned is, especially in particular equivocal circumstances such as those subsisting in the present case, necessarily somewhat suspect and could not be regarded as substantiated by adequate evidence.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"

The Committee, therefore, recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the observations made above, that the case does not call for further examination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898333, response status: 200"
