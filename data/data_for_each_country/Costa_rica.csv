Where JAPDEVA does not possess the necessary equipment and must use equipment belonging to companies outside the institution, that equipment must be operated by JAPDEVA staff, unless, owing to its nature, there is insufficient supply of the required equipment on the market and/or the owner requires that its own staff remain responsible for the equipment owing to the need for it to be operated by specialists, in which case SINTRAJAP states explicitly that said staff shall be able to operate the equipment continuously and without hindrance, in accordance with the provisions of this article.It is understood that JAPDEVA shall take all the necessary steps to acquire the appropriate resources to carry out its functions and to provide adequate training to the staff required owing to the modernization of port equipment.Should the port and development operations be wholly or partially handed over to another State or private entity, the workers covered by this agreement shall continue to enjoy all the rights set out herein, in accordance with the provisions of article 37 of the Labour Code.

The complainants state that SINTRAJAP lodged a judicial complaint in this regard. According to the documents submitted by the complainants, on 10 August 2018, as part of file No. 18-000657-0679-LA, the Labour Court of the First Judicial Circuit of the Atlantic Zone granted the injunctive relief requested by the trade union and ordered the immediate suspension of all dismissals while the proceedings were ongoing.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141442, response status: 200"

The enterprise states that (i) in 2007, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic authorized the contracting of an international consultant to draw up a master plan for the Lim贸n-Mo铆n port complex and an evaluation of the dredging of channels in the north and the dredging equipment necessary for the maintenance of the navigation channels; (ii) in 2008 the consultant submitted the final report on the master plan which recommended several measures, such as an increase to infrastructure capacity and preparations for the concession and construction of a new container port terminal and the transfer of container loading and unloading port services to a private concession-holder; and (iii) in 2009 an international public tender notice was published, and on 1 March 2011, based on the General Act on the Concession of Public Works with Public Services, the executive authority, comprising the President of the Republic, the Minister of Public Works and Transport and the Minister of Finance, awarded the concession to fund, design, construct, operate and maintain a new container terminal at Mo铆n for a period of 33 years (agreement No. 018 MOPT-H).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141442, response status: 200"

The Government states that there was an understanding between the parties that the process would be undertaken in a climate of industrial peace and openness in order to reach an agreement that benefited the enterprise鈥檚 workers and notes that those negotiations began in 2008. There was therefore no unilateral decision-making on the part of the Government; on the contrary, the sectors involved participated actively throughout the process.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141442, response status: 200"

The enterprise states that over the last 12 years, it has undertaken four studies and proposals to amend its organizational structure. It notes that the latest reorganization programme was presented in March 2019, prior to the financial crisis that it is currently facing. The enterprise states that work on that reorganization proposal was undertaken with representatives of its different departments using inputs from previous studies. It adds that the reorganization proposal was shared with SINTRAJAP through official communication No. PE-184-2019 of 10 July 2019. It also states that the enterprise鈥檚 directors met with SINTRAJAP on various occasions to discuss the transformation process, and that the enterprise received observations from the trade union representatives, which were addressed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141442, response status: 200"

The enterprise highlights that meetings were held with the trade union representatives, who continually submitted queries on the legislation to the management, and that meetings were held between SINTRAJAP, the management of the enterprise and representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security so that their questions on points of interpretation or differences of opinion between the parties could be addressed. It also highlights the high value of inter-agency coordination during this stage, and that, additionally, several informative guides were distributed that detailed the different steps that would be taken in the enterprise鈥檚 transformation process.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141442, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that the Government and the enterprise state that (i) in 2007, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic authorized the contracting of a consultancy to draw up a master plan for the port complex; (ii) in 2008 an international consultant recommended that the enterprise adopt measures including the construction of a new container terminal and the transfer of container loading and unloading port services to a private concession-holder; (iii) in 2009 a public tender notice was published, and in 2011 the executive authority awarded the concession to design, fund, construct, operate and maintain the Mo铆n container terminal to the transnational company for 33 years; (iv) in 2019 Act No. 9764 on the transformation of the enterprise and the protection of its workers was adopted and, prior to the presentation of the bill, the Government held negotiations with SINTRAJAP and reached agreements that benefited both the enterprise and the workers, and there was an understanding to undertake the process in a climate of industrial peace (the Government states that those negotiations began in 2008); and (v) during the transformation process, meetings were held between the enterprise, Government authorities and workers鈥?representatives, including SINTRAJAP, to which the reorganization programme was communicated in advance.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141442, response status: 200"

The Committee understands, according to publicly available information, that the construction of the container terminal began in 2015 and that the terminal has been operational since February 2019. The Committee observes that the complainants allege that the enterprise failed to observe the collective agreement because it did not inform, or consult with, SINTRAJAP with regard to the fate of the jobs that would be affected by the operationalization of the terminal. The Committee understands that the operationalization of the terminal and the transfer of the entirety of the container loading and unloading services to the transnational company would lead to the transformation and restructuring of the enterprise.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4141442, response status: 200"

While recalling that agreements should be binding on the parties and that mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, paras 1334 and 1336], the Committee observes that the documentation provided appears to indicate that there were instances of dialogue with SINTRAJAP with regard to the fate of the jobs and the restructuring of the enterprise: (i) a bulletin that SINTRAJAP shared with its members dated 24 August 2018 (No. 11-2018) states that on 18 July that year the trade union had its first meeting with the enterprise to begin analysis of the issues relating to the restructuring; (ii) in another bulletin dated 28 August 2018 (No. 12-2018) SINTRAJAP informs its members that it has met with the Minister of Labour and that round tables have been established to capture the interests of the workers who wish to transfer to other public institutions voluntarily; (iii) through official communication No. PE-184-2019 of 10 July 2019, the enterprise shared with SINTRAJAP a document entitled 鈥淚nstitutional Reorganization Programme鈥?

Although the court of first instance ordered the enterprise to revoke the dismissal of the worker, an application for judicial review was filed and, in the labour inspector鈥檚 report dated 20 May 2019, it was concluded that there had been no discriminatory dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy given that all staff at the work site had been dismissed due to the enterprise鈥檚 financial situation (the Government indicates that on 8 November 2019, the file was ordered to be definitively closed); and (iii) a letter submitted on 9 April 2019 to the Inspection Department of the Lim贸n office, in which the enterprise notified the dismissals carried out on 27 March, which included persons protected by special immunity.

The Government also indicates that the parties agreed that the union would inform the former workers of the agreement in order to ensure social peace; that the union undertook to withdraw the court proceedings; and that the union and the MTSS undertook to maintain channels of communication and dialogue open on employment-related matters in the Lim贸n area, and to set up a dialogue table for the private sector in order to promote employability initiatives.

The complainant organization states that the CLA was valid for three years and that, on 1 April 2016, both unions denounced it with a view to negotiating the second CLA. The complainant organization states that the negotiation process for the second CLA was undertaken by a union coalition comprising the two aforementioned unions, as well as the APSE and the National Association of Teachers (ANDE). The complainant organization alleges that, when the negotiations for the second CLA were completed and that all that remained was for the agreement to be signed, the Minister for Education unilaterally and arbitrarily excluded the APSE and concluded the CLA with the other three unions. The complainant organization claims that not only had the APSE actively participated in the process of negotiating the CLA, but that it is also the most representative union of the MEP as it is the one to which the majority of unionized workers from the different categories of public employees who provide their services in the Ministry belong.

The complainant organization states that the Board is a joint body established under the agreement, composed of representatives of the MEP and representatives of the unions that signed the CLA, and it has broad negotiating powers.

According to the complainant organization, the refusal to provide this information is part of the institutional, systematic, discriminatory and anti-union targeting of the APSE, which, as a whole, causes it serious and irreversible damage that threatens its normal functioning, substantially restricting the performance of the union role and threatening the very existence of the union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081848, response status: 200"

This CLA was approved on 17 May 2013 and entered into force a day later, with a period of validity of three years, that is to say until 18聽May 2016.

The Government states that, although the negotiations for the second CLA took place quickly and in a positive way, the discussion within the Legislative Branch of a bill (Act No. 19506 on arrangements for additional remuneration beyond the base salary of the public sector) had divided the activities of the unions that were in the process of negotiating the second CLA: while the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE stayed at the negotiating table for the CLA, the APSE left the coalition and unilaterally abandoned the negotiation process, calling a general strike to be held on 29聽June 2016 in protest against the bill. The Government states that the actions of the APSE forced the MEP to continue the process of dialogue towards the second CLA only with the organizations that decided to remain at the negotiating table. The Government denies the allegation that the MEP excluded the APSE from the negotiations in an act of anti-union reprisal and maintains that the APSE, in disagreement with the rest of the coalition of teachers鈥?unions with regard to strategy for mounting a campaign, withdrew itself from the negotiating table.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081848, response status: 200"

It was approved on 10 June 2016, entered into force the day after its approval (11 June 2016) and was valid for one year from that date, that is to say until 11 June 2017. The Government states that, on 5 May 2017, as the expiry date of the second CLA approached, the APSE requested the MEP to begin the process of negotiating the third CLA, for which it submitted a draft for negotiation. The Government states that the APSE had informed the MEP of several attempts to ensure that the third CLA could be negotiated and signed jointly with the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE, but that its direct efforts had not met with success, so it requested the Minister of Labour to convene all union organizations so that they could reach an understanding and jointly negotiate the next CLA. The Government has sent a copy of a letter that the APSE sent to the Minister for Public Education on 5 May 2017, in which the APSE acknowledges the efforts made by the Minister for Labour in having invited all the union organizations to a meeting to be held on 4 May 2017, so that they could reach an understanding and jointly negotiate the draft version of the next collective agreement. In this letter, the APSE confirms that the SEC, SITRACOME and the ANDE did not attend that meeting and that, when the Minister for Labour insisted on holding another meeting on 5 May 2017, the organizations stated that they could not attend that one either, thereby demonstrating a lack of interest in the joint negotiation process. The Government states that the MEP has always been in favour of the participation of the APSE in the negotiations for the third CLA and stresses that, although it made efforts to help the unions overcome their differences and participate in collective bargaining as a united group, it did not achieve its goal of reconciling them.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081848, response status: 200"

According to the Government, the MEP informed the APSE that: (i) it could not engage in negotiations with the APSE, which until then had not demonstrated through the appropriate mechanisms that it was more entitled than the group in question to represent the collective labour interests of the workers of the MEP; and (ii) it was prevented, as an employer, from intervening in the internal affairs of the unions and was prohibited from taking unilateral decisions with respect to the union representation of the workers. The Government further states that the membership that the APSE claims to have from among the public employees of the MEP is not correct because the number it cites includes retirees who are no longer actively working in the education sector.

The University indicates that SINDEU did not accept its proposal and that, in the absence of an agreement, the matter was brought to the attention of the University Council, which is a high-level deliberative body of the University that nonetheless has no legal competence in matters of staff administration or salary-setting, but rather has historically acted as a mediation body.

The University states that that proposal was unacceptable, not only because it sought to maintain a policy of salary increases well in excess of inflation, which is not covered by article 6 of the collective labour agreement and would jeopardize the economic stability of the institution, but also because article 6 does not in any case provide that cost-of-living increases should include other items.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

SINDEU claims that the adjustments should be made on the basis of the increase designated in the State budget for higher education, through the Special Fund for Higher Education. However, article 6 of the agreement does not indicate in any of its clauses that the parameter or criterion for setting salary increases should be the Special Fund increase. Moreover, with regard to setting the salary increase for 2017, the University notes that, although three meetings were held, SINDEU had already filed a lawsuit against the University.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

First of all, the University indicates that the annuity payment constitutes an increase in annual salary, which in the case of the University (unlike most other entities of the public administration) is calculated on the basis of the total salary of the previous year and not only on the base salary. That increase is added to the cost-of-living increase, as provided in article 6 of the collective labour agreement, and is also added on top of other bonuses, such as overtime pay, the exclusive employment benefit and other supplementary bonuses. The annuity payment is distinguished from the base salary payment, in the sense that the latter is a payment that is made on the basis of the category and functions of the worker, whereas the percentage of the annuity payment is a fixed and automatic percentage for all workers employed by the University, which is theoretically linked to performance evaluations but in practice has resulted in an automatic salary increase.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

That outcome was based on a judicial interpretation of the scope of the so-called Medical Science Professionals Incentives Act, which is a law of general scope for all medical science workers. The University indicates that, in order not to disadvantage other employees, the University Council decided to grant the 5.5 per cent annuity to all employees. That was put into effect by increasing the 3 per cent annuity paid under the collective labour agreement to 5.5 per cent. The University indicates, however, that, a few years later, the jurisprudence of the Second Chamber changed, giving the University the discretion, as an employer, to set the percentage of the annuity incentive payment for employees in the field of medical sciences.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

The University asserts that it has respected the acquired rights of employees, in the sense of respecting all the annuities that they had already accumulated, with the percentages prevalent while those rights were in force. On the other hand, the University considers that it was neither prudent nor appropriate for the matter to be referred to the Labour Relations Board for the following reasons: (i) the issue had already been dealt with directly between the Rector and SINDEU and, considering that the Labour Relations Board represented the same parties, it was unproductive to merely continue to discuss the same issue in a different venue; and (ii)聽the decisions of the Labour Relations Board, under article聽26 of the collective labour agreement, are not binding. Moreover, the University indicates that, in any case, article 79 of the agreement adopted in 1996 refers to provisions, contracts and customs prior to the negotiation of that agreement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

The University indicates that the three individuals were employees who were performing a job under an agreement that the University had with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund and that, when the agreement between those two entities expired, the University found itself in the situation of lacking the funds to be able to maintain employment, which is provided for in article 192 of the Political Constitution. Moreover, a dismissal in such circumstances is also not prohibited by the collective labour agreement in article 67, since it is neither a dismissal for disciplinary reasons nor does it lack a valid legal cause. The University indicates that it had made a commitment to SINDEU to continue to employ the dismissed workers if they met the University鈥檚 entry requirements and participated in several competitions, without being favoured for not having achieved the necessary score.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

The Committee is not aware whether or not SINDEU appealed the above-mentioned judgment.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

In that regard, the Committee recalls that it has emphasized the importance of resolving conflicts of interpretation of a collective agreement through the mechanisms provided for that purpose by the agreement itself or, in any event, by an impartial mechanism that should be accessible to the parties to the agreement, such as an independent judicial body (see Report 382, Case No. 3162, paragraph 296, and Report 391, Case No. 3243, paragraph 189; both cases concern Costa Rica). Recalling also that mutual respect for the commitments undertaken in collective labour agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, para. 1336], the Committee is confident that, in the event of further conflicts of interpretation in relation to the collective labour agreement, these will be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that: (i)聽article 9 provides for a detailed calculation mechanism for the salary adjustment to be granted in January and July of each year; that article does not indicate that the salary adjustment should be agreed between SINDEU and the University; (ii) article 14 provides that the University shall pay University staff an annuity of 3.75 per cent; and (iii) article 32 provides that it is for the Labour Relations Board to take up the claims brought by workers concerning the rights stipulated in the collective agreement and other related labour rights. The Committee notes that the Labour Relations Board, composed of members appointed by the University and SINDEU, has functional autonomy, the duty of impartiality in the exercise of its functions, is budgetarily attached to the Office of Human Resources and must produce a recommendation within one month of receipt of an application.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

In that regard, the Committee notes that, according to the University, it had made a commitment to SINDEU that, if they met the entry requirements, it would keep the dismissed workers, who, after participating in several competitions, did not achieve the necessary score. The Committee understands that participation in the competitions was made on equal terms for all participants, including trade unionists.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059202, response status: 200"

In this regard, the security firm states that the Labour Relations Board is currently comprised of two trade union representatives from SITEPP and two employer representatives, and that it does not oppose members of the other trade unions participating in the Labour Relations Board, but that this must be agreed upon by the trade unions and not imposed by the firm. The security firm also indicates that an agreement is still in force that was concluded in 2013 with SITEPP, a trade union that is more strongly represented in the firm. The agreement was concluded before the conciliation tribunal established by the Labour Court and was in force until 22 November 2017. The private security firm adds that, in a decision of 14 July 2014, the Labour Court urged SINTRAGFOUR to negotiate before the Ministry of Labour and Social Security the possibility of SITEPP sharing its participation in the Labour Relations Board. The firm also indicates that it repeatedly attended hearings convened by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, as recorded in the minutes provided by the complainant, with the aim of reaching an agreement with the trade unions, but the unions were not able to reach an agreement, and SINTRAGFOUR took this opportunity to accuse the firm of anti-union dismissals. Lastly, the firm states that, based on the foregoing, any accusation of anti-union harassment made against it must be disregarded, and that it remains open to dialogue and finding solutions that allow the firm and the trade unions to coexist harmoniously.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3996601, response status: 200"

Moreover, this Act allows for, by means of a summary procedure known as a labour safeguard, the issuance of a pre-sentence decision, which suspends the effects of the proceedings and orders the interim reinstatement of the worker concerned in his or her post. Lastly, this Act will allow, in cases in which the employment relationship is terminated, the worker to obtain a settlement of the sums owed more quickly than is currently possible, through the arbitration and conflict resolution services of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3996601, response status: 200"

The Committee also recalls that if the judicial authority 鈥?or an independent competent body 鈥?determines that reinstatement of trade union members is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, adequate compensation should be awarded to remedy all damages suffered and prevent any repetition of such acts in the future, so as to constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction against acts of anti-union discrimination [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, paras聽1167聽and 1175].

The Committee also notes that the complainants provide an incomplete list of the 150 dismissed workers affiliated to the union in the annexes to the complaint. Secondly, the Committee observes that the company informs it that those dismissals were based on objective grounds, as a result of the closure of several large contracts and, in many cases, conciliation was reached with the workers concerned. The company indicates that the real problem is that, unlike the most representative union, SINTRAGFOUR does not participate in the Labour Relations Board of the company, an internal body established by collective agreement that examines and takes decisions regarding dismissals without employer liability. The company indicates that this problem should be resolved by the unions concerned.

The complainants specifically allege that: (i) for decades, industrial relations between the Bank and its employees have been governed by the collective labour agreement, which under article 62 of the Costa Rican Constitution, has force of law in the country; (ii) following an irregular practice adopted by public authorities in recent years, the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic filed an application for constitutional review of article 45 of the Bank鈥檚 collective agreement, requesting its partial annulment; (iii) article 45 of the agreement establishes that the Bank shall provide severance pay to its employees for the years worked when they retire, resign or are dismissed with or without employer liability; (iv) article 45 also provides that severance pay shall amount to a month鈥檚 wages for each year worked prior to 1 March 2001, while the calculation for the years worked after that date shall be based on the formula set forth in the Labour Code; (v) the application for constitutional review filed by the Office of the Comptroller alleges that this article is excessive and contrary to the principles of equality, reasonableness and efficient use of public funds; and (vi) although, in the above-mentioned vote, the Constitutional Chamber declared that the application was unfounded and that, therefore, the relevant clause of the collective agreement was not unconstitutional, it ruled that, for the clause to be considered constitutional, the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay must not exceed 20.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017607, response status: 200"

The complainants state in this respect that: (i) all the arguments put forward by the Office of the Comptroller in its application for constitutional review were rejected by the Court, as article 45 of the collective agreement does not foster discrimination, violate any fundamental right or undermine the principles of proportionality and reasonableness; (ii) there are no grounds whatsoever for limiting the number of years used to calculate severance pay to 20 years of work; and (iii) by imposing this limit that unilaterally amends the relevant clause of the collective agreement and thus distorts it, the Court is overstepping its mandate, violating the principle of free collective bargaining and disregarding the specific procedure, which respects due process, laid down in the Public Administration Act for the suppression of rights acquired under a collective agreement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017607, response status: 200"

The organizations specifically state that: (i) the current article 35 of the Bank鈥檚 fourth collective agreement refers to the formula for payment of the Bank鈥檚 employees鈥?wages and states that 鈥淲ages are weekly. Any economic benefit affecting wages shall be calculated on the basis of the weekly wage 鈥?that is, the monthly amount divided by four over 52 weeks鈥? (ii) although this article has formed part of the Bank鈥檚 collective agreement for over 30 years, the Bank has decided to use a different formula from the standard one and has been dividing by 4.33, which means that the workers鈥?wages are lower than the agreed wages; (iii) SIBANPO submitted the matter for judicial review, and while the findings were not in its favour at first instance, the first-instance judgments were fully revoked by 13 second-instance judgments issued between 27 February and 15 June 2012, when the Court of Appeal found that the Bank had strayed from the collective agreement; and (iv) the Bank applied to the Labour Chamber of the Supreme Court, which revoked the above-mentioned second-instance decisions by means of 13 decisions issued between 10 and 31 August 2012, finding, without evidence, that the payment formulas would have been included in the salary scales and that the employer had complied with the relevant clause of the collective agreement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017607, response status: 200"

The Government states that, by majority, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court considered that the contested clause was not unconstitutional, provided that the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay did not exceed 20. Referring to the relevant extracts of the judgment, the Government indicates that the Constitutional Chamber: (i) recognized, on the basis of article 75(3) of the Constitutional Jurisdiction Act, the authority of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic to file such an application for constitutional review, as it seeks to safeguard public funds; (ii) in a majority vote, recognized the possibility of challenging, through an application for constitutional review, a collective agreement, given that 鈥渢he obligations assumed by public institutions and their employees may be subject to an assessment of reasonableness, economy and efficiency, either to prevent the rights of the workers themselves from being restricted or undermined through a collective agreement or to prevent excessive use of public funds鈥? (iii)聽with regard to higher benefits concerning severance pay in clauses of collective agreements, recalled that it had accepted the setting of higher limits through collective agreements, as the Labour Code establishes minimum standards that may be exceeded, provided that the gains remain within the parameters of reasonableness and proportionality. The Chamber has thus accepted the existence of severance pay limits that exceed eight years, but not 20; and (iv) the final decision of the Court, which declared the clause to be constitutional provided that it did not exceed a maximum limit, sought to prevent the misuse of public funds, to the detriment of the public services that the Bank is required to provide, and also noted that there were no valid grounds for giving the employees of the Bank in question special treatment.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017607, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that the complainant organizations refer, first, to the alleged violation of article 45 of the collective agreement, which establishes that the Bank shall provide severance pay to its employees for the years worked when they retire, resign or are dismissed and alleges in this regard that: (i) this article, which has been included in successive versions of the collective agreement for decades, provides that severance pay shall amount to a month鈥檚 wages for each year worked prior to 1 March 2001, while the calculation for the years worked after that date shall be based on the formula set forth in the Labour Code (section 29 of the Labour Code provides for compensation of between 19.5 and 22 days鈥?wages per year worked, depending on length of service, and limits the years used to calculate severance pay to the last eight years worked); (ii) the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic filed an application for constitutional review of this clause, arguing that it is excessive and contrary to the principles of equality, reasonableness and efficient use of public funds; (iii) although, in its judgment of August 2014, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court declared that the application for constitutional review was unfounded and that, therefore, the relevant clause of the collective agreement was not unconstitutional, it ruled that, for the clause to be considered constitutional, the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay must not exceed 20; (iv) this judgment is legally incoherent, as it rejects the arguments regarding unconstitutionality put forward by the Office of the Comptroller while unilaterally amending the terms agreed upon by the signatories of the agreement; (v) the establishment of a limit for the calculation of severance pay is not based on any legal argument and is the result of political pressure; (vi) it must be taken into consideration that the Bank in question enjoys full budgetary autonomy, that its employees are governed by the private employment regime and that, therefore, the amount of severance pay has no bearing; (vii) there is a specific mechanism, which respects due process, established in the Public Administration Act for the suppression of rights acquired under a collective agreement; and (viii) in the light of the foregoing, the judgment in question is in clear violation of Convention No. 98, ratified by Costa Rica, and the right of social partners to freely negotiate working conditions and to improve the benefits provided for in the legislation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017607, response status: 200"

The Committee observes from the judgment of 14 August 2014 that: (i) the application for the constitutional review filed by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, requesting annulment of article 45 of the collective agreement relating to severance pay, was based on the amount of severance pay as well as the circumstances envisaged for such payments (any type of termination of the employment relationship and not simply dismissal without just cause); (ii)聽the Constitutional Chamber found that industrial relations between the Bank and its employees is not governed exclusively by private law; (iii) the Constitutional Chamber recognized the authority of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic to file such applications for constitutional review, as it seeks to safeguard public funds; (iv) by means of a majority vote, the Constitutional Chamber considered that 鈥渢he obligations assumed by public institutions and their employees may be subject to an assessment of reasonableness, economy and efficiency, either to prevent the rights of the workers themselves from being restricted or undermined through a collective agreement or to prevent excessive use of public funds鈥? (v) while it recognized the constitutional nature of the relevant clause of the Bank鈥檚 collective agreement, the Constitutional Chamber nevertheless ruled that, for the clause to be considered constitutional, the number of years used for the calculation of severance pay must not exceed 20; (vi) the Chamber found that although it is constitutional to establish, through collective bargaining, benefits that exceed the minimum benefits provided for in the Labour Code, the Chamber is responsible for ensuring that parameters of reasonableness and proportionality are respected to prevent the excessive use of public funds; and (vii) the Constitutional Chamber applied the same solution that it had applied to another public institution in a previous judgment dated 17 May 2006 (Judgment No. 2006-06730) to the Bank.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017607, response status: 200"

In the light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps, including legislative measures if necessary, so that the authorities give preference as far as possible to collective bargaining mechanisms in assessing matters of public interest in relation to economic benefits in clauses of public sector collective agreements.

In this regard, the Committee recalls that a fair and reasonable compromise should be sought between the need to preserve as far as possible the autonomy of the bargaining parties, on the one hand, and measures which must be taken by governments to overcome their budgetary difficulties, on the other [see聽Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, para. 1485] .","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017607, response status: 200"

The complainants state that the enterprise initiated administrative proceedings against the ARESEP resolution, but that that action was overruled on the basis of Law No. 7593 (the law establishing ARESEP), which provides that ARESEP may exclude costs contrary to the principle of a paying service, which have no direct relation with the provision of service, or which are disproportionate and excessive. The complainants included a copy of a letter sent on 18 January 2016 by the Executive Director of the enterprise to the President of SINTRAJAP, stating that by virtue of the above ruling and of ARESEP resolution No. 3223, payment of the leave of absence envisaged under the collective agreement was not possible.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059178, response status: 200"

So much so that, in all years between 2003 and 2015, ARESEP issued no further resolution when making adjustments to tariffs that would imply a failure to recognize costs arising from collective agreements in force in regulated enterprises or institutions. The complainants state that up until 2015, ARESEP covered all costs payable under the collective labour agreements without hesitation, thus recognizing that such costs were part of the production costs of enterprises and institutions providing paying services.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059178, response status: 200"

The complainants indicate that ARESEP cites Law No. 7593 in the resolutions, which provides that it may exclude costs that are contrary to the principle of a paying service, which have no direct relation with the provision of service, or which are disproportionate and excessive; and that although collective agreements are legally valid texts, the collective agreements in question contain clauses that are clearly contrary to the principle of a paying service and to the principle of financial equilibrium as understood in the cited law. The complainants indicate that because ARESEP鈥檚 tariff resolutions are binding, the enterprises were no longer able to honour their obligations under the collective agreements, thus removing all economic content from the agreements. The complainants state that the enterprises cannot legally generate profits through their business activities and that the only means available to them to cover the costs of collective agreements is through the tariffs that they charge, which are fixed by ARESEP.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059178, response status: 200"

The complainants explain that the SITET filed for the protection of their constitutional rights (filed an amparo appeal) before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice against ARESEP resolutions Nos 113, 114 and 115 of 2015 in respect of the electrical Enterprise, on the grounds that they were in breach of article 62 of the Constitution (under which collective agreements have force of law) and of Convention No. 98. According to the complainants, the Constitutional Chamber rejected the appeal on the grounds that it concerned questions that should be dealt with in an administrative or common law court, and not by a constitutional court.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4059178, response status: 200"

ARESEP indicates that Law No. 7593 provides that it may exclude costs contrary to the principle of a paying service which have no direct relation to the provision of the service and that one of the criteria that ARESEP is obliged to take into consideration when fixing prices, tariffs or rates, was economic efficiency (article 31). Article 32(b) and (c) explicitly sets out that the following cannot be accepted as costs of regulated enterprises: 鈥渆xpenditures that are unnecessary for, or unconnected to, the provision of a public Service鈥?and 鈥渃ontributions, costs, investments and debts incurred for activities unconnected to the administration, operation or maintenance of the regulated activity鈥?

The Committee further notes that the complainant states that deduction of the 鈥渁ssociated costs鈥?from the incentive payment greatly reduces the amount of money available for distribution among entitled employees of the institution, and is thus seriously detrimental to all the Bank鈥檚 employees. According to the complainant, whereas, in the past, the State violated collective agreements through unconstitutional actions, now, through the CGR, it is de facto interpreting and amending collective agreements.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3329898, response status: 200"

The Committee notes in this regard the complainant鈥檚 allegation that the CGR imposed an interpretation of the clause relating to payment of an incentive bonus known as the SEDI without having competence to do so and that, furthermore, the judicial proceeding brought by the union to challenge that interpretation was declared inadmissible by the Employment Court of the Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos茅 (Case No. 15-0713-0166-LA) (the complainant has not enclosed a copy of this judgment). According to the complainant, the Court ordered the case to be closed, finding that the unions do not have competence to bring cases to trial for the purposes of enforcing the contents of a collective agreement, and that they must obtain special powers from their members before representing them in judicial proceedings. The Committee notes that the complainant has attached to its complaint a copy of an appeal submitted to the Higher Employment Tribunal on 13 August 2015, on which no ruling has yet been made. The Committee observes that in its appeal the union emphasized that the case concerns not the individual interests of Bank employees but a collective agreement signed by the union. The Committee also notes that the Government refers to the existence of four judicial proceedings relating to the Bank鈥檚 actions taken in response to the ruling of the CGR, which are awaiting settlement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3329898, response status: 200"

Accordingly, the Committee considers that this difference in interpretation of article 63 of the collective agreement should be resolved by the mechanisms provided for such purpose in the agreement itself, or in any event by an impartial mechanism which should be accessible to both parties signatory to the agreement, such as an independent judicial body. On the basis of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant to keep it informed of the outcome of the ongoing judicial proceedings.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3329898, response status: 200"

The complainant states that the union official had already gone to the Public Prosecutor鈥檚 Office to give an account of the facts, and that the judicial authority had issued a restraining order to stay away from the Canton of Desamparados. He was detained in the presence of press and television reporters, who reported on the following day that the union official had been detained for threatening a witness and tampering with the scene of an accident in which a 19-year-old man died.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3144107, response status: 200"

The general aim of this strike was to obtain certain occupational health benefits and better physical working conditions, which would also bring about a substantial improvement in the services provided. They had no alternative but to resort to strike action given the refusal by the CCSS Fund to engage in negotiations on their justified demands. UNDECA adds that two users, to whom attention could not be given, filed amparo proceedings against the authorities of two centres (M茅xico Hospital and San Vicente De Pa煤l Hospital); these proceedings were upheld by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court under Ruling Nos 17211-2011 and 17212-2011 of 14 December 2011, although the unions concerned were not allowed to take part in the proceedings; moreover, the Constitutional Chamber overstepped its powers by prohibiting the right to strike in essential services, and in hospital services in particular.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

Consequently, article 376, paragraph (d) prohibits strike action in public services that cause serious or immediate prejudice to health, as in the case of clinics and hospitals. Likewise, the Committee on Freedom of Association and experts of the ILO have indicated that strike action may be prohibited in essential public services, in other words, in those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the population. These criteria were endorsed by a majority in the Chamber, receiving the votes of judges Mr Ginesta Lobo, Mr Cruz Castro, Mr Castillo V铆quez, Mr Rueda Leal and Mr Salazar Cambronera, who considered that strike action is prohibited in hospital services, as an essential public service and in view of the protection of the constitutional rights to health and life of the population. In addition, the Chamber indicated that public sector conciliation, arbitration and direct bargaining procedures cannot be governed by common labour laws and regulations, which vary significantly from the public employment system, where the flexibility of principles such as free will and minimum rights does not apply, where the administration is subject to a whole block of regulations and where decisions based on conscience or juries without legal training are not admissible. Breaching this gap through legislative development is not incumbent upon the Constitutional Chamber but on the legislative branch, under the principle that the constitutional judge should not be judge and party to the same cause. Currently, the Legislative Assembly is discussing a draft labour procedure reform aiming to regulate this matter.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

In the cases examined, as a result of the anaesthetists鈥?strike, the treatment of the two plaintiffs, who suffer from cancer, was suspended and they were not admitted into hospital or operated on on the previously scheduled dates. One judge endorses the majority vote on the grounds that the plaintiffs鈥?right to health was violated, but she has not made any statement on the legality of strike action in essential public services arguing that this is not the appropriate channel for a ruling on strike action in essential services. One judge dissented, disallowing the amparo proceedings on the grounds that a sentence resulting from amparo proceedings cannot prohibit the right to strike in hospital services, in particular, and as recognized in the resolution, since the legal regulations on alternative means to resolve labour disputes, like this one, are insufficient.

Under the rules in force, amparo proceedings are intended to protect fundamental rights in the case of any act, provision, agreement, resolution, omission or material act that threatens or violates fundamental rights, except for those protected under habeas corpus. The Constitutional Chamber itself has described it as a 鈥渉ighly summary鈥?informal process, strictly aimed at determining whether specific and subjective actions, generally ordered by the administration, have violated any fundamental human right. Amparo proceedings are not an appropriate means of challenging the constitutional nature of laws or legislative provisions, which is an area that is covered by proceedings on the grounds of unconstitutionality (a distinction that has not been observed in this case). Neither is this type of action appropriate for matters of general legality, and the Chamber cannot determine which regulations are applied to a specific case. The scope of amparo proceedings is limited to determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether a given act or omission has violated a fundamental right.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

An appropriate solution to the conflict of these interests, which are both protected by the Constitution, is reasonably possible without abolishing the right to strike of public servants providing essential services, through the use of minimum services, which the Constitutional Chamber has unfortunately ignored or rejected in the rulings that are challenged here, and which is consistent with the principles of the ILO.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

Consequently, the right to life, recognized under article 21 of the Constitution, provides the basis for all the other fundamental rights of the inhabitants of the Republic. This same article provides the basis for the right to health, since life is inconceivable if humans are not guaranteed the minimum conditions for an adequate and harmonious psychological, physical and environmental balance. In this way, any delay in hospitals, clinics and other health care units of the CCSS Fund could have a negative impact on the preservation of the health and life of its users.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

In any event, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), establishes that the plan of action of workers鈥?organizations must respect the law, whereby it would be a reasonable restriction to limit the exercise of the right to strike in those services the interruption of which would endanger the health and life of the population. This concurs with what happened as a result of the doctors鈥?strike mentioned in this complaint, which clearly caused delays in various surgical procedures, seriously violating key fundamental rights of the population. In this light, according to Report No. PR-39.907-2012 of the Governing Board of the CCSS Fund, the strike in question lasted for 14 days and led to the suspension of previously planned surgery in the case of 2,581 insured patients, as well as generating an average cost for the institution of 21,700,000 colons (CRC) a day.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

In this regard, it stated:It should be recalled that, in the light of the Constitution, there is a difference between freedom of association, understood as the right to form and join trade unions, which applies equally to public servants with both an administrative or statutory relationship with the public services 鈥?and to other workers in an employment relationship 鈥? and the right to strike, which is the extreme expression of trade union activity, and which applies with greater limitations, with a view to maintaining essential community services.

The right to strike cannot be considered to be an absolute right; strike action may be subject to a general ban, not only in exceptional circumstances, but it may also be regulated through provisions that impose modalities in the exercise of that fundamental right or restrictions to its exercise. Strikes are considered as the last resort for workers鈥?organizations in pursuing their labour grievances 鈥?In other words, the right to strike is a right for all workers that may be exercised in any sector, but the legislator must determine the cases in which it must not be exercised, as in the case of public services that, due to their nature and social impact, cannot be suspended, discontinued or paralysed without causing large scale serious and immediate damage.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

The Government adds that, as the supervisory bodies of the ILO are aware, the right to collective bargaining in positive law in Costa Rica and in national practice, in addition to being an outstanding collective instrument, benefits from a higher level of protection due to its constitutional status. This collective instrument aims to regulate labour conditions and to determine the competence of trade unions to represent workers in negotiating these. In the public sector, collective bargaining is open to all public servants, except for those participating in public management with executive power, in accordance with article 2 of the regulations for the negotiation of collective agreements in the public sector. Evidence of the above is that there are currently 70 collective agreements in force in the public sector according to the dedicated register kept by the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112113, response status: 200"

The complainant organization further criticizes the interpretation of various constitutional and legal regulations regarding the scope of the rulings of the Constitutional Chamber in cases of amparo proceedings, considering that the Constitutional Chamber has not observed these.

During the negotiations, the National Bank of Costa Rica sought to exclude new officials joining the staff from January 2013 onwards from benefiting from the financial advantages provided for in the collective agreement. The complainants add that the meetings of the Collective Agreement Bargaining Committee have now been suspended, not just because of the time-consuming and cumbersome practice of holding endless consultations on each and every point, but also because of the employer鈥檚 decision to condition further negotiations on SEBANA鈥檚 acceptance of a new system of remuneration known as the 鈥渟ingle salary鈥? which entails raising the base salary for newly recruited employees and for any established officials wishing to join the scheme, and aligning their salaries with those on the labour market in the sector. It is the Government鈥檚 general policy to introduce a single salary for the public sector, which involves the disappearance of benefits obtained through collective bargaining. The current system of remuneration in the National Bank, which is set out in the collective agreement, regulates the various salary components, the payment of overtime, seniority increments and other incentives that have been acquired over the more than 30 years that the agreement has been in effect. Under this system, the base salary rises with years of service and other incentives which are not contrary to the labour legislation in force and are covered by the collective agreement. Following the administration鈥檚 proposal, referred to in the previous paragraph, the banking authorities proposed that a single salary be introduced in the National Bank as part of a single salary policy for the public administration as a whole. By way of justification the bank cites the need to introduce competitive market salaries so as to prevent the loss of skilled employees, and thereby boost the bank鈥檚 profits. More importantly, the single salary would mean a very significant reduction in its administrative and operating costs. Obviously, the fact that the salaries of National Bank employees are lagging behind the market rates is due entirely to the bank administration, which has negotiated salary increases based on the restrictive criteria of the cost of living, and has not conceded real salary increases.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112002, response status: 200"

The administration wants to guarantee the rights embodied in the collective agreement only for 鈥渆stablished workers鈥? and not for newly recruited employees. The proposal to create two categories of employees and a single salary does not bear analysis from the standpoint of protecting the workers鈥?human rights. It implies the total elimination of all financial advantages embodied in the existing collective agreement, both for new employees and for any others who agree to join the new scheme. Moreover, it is proposed that entitlement to redundancy benefits, which under the present collective agreement are payable for 25 years at a rate of one month for each of the 25 years of service, be reduced to eight years, or the equivalent of eight months鈥?salary, irrespective of the number of years of service, which is the minimum provided for in the Labour Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112002, response status: 200"

This in no way inhibits the conduct of equitable and adequate collective bargaining, either for the workers or for the bank. It is important to emphasize that the whole purpose of collective bargaining is to reach a consensus through a meeting of minds, in which each party is prepared to yield some ground to the other in a bid to reach a mid-point that is satisfactory to both.

Costa Rica鈥檚 Constitution grants the public administration autonomy in administrative affairs, just as the General Public Administration Act confers on it the power to issue regulations. This means that an institution such as the National Bank of Costa Rica, if it deems it desirable, is entitled to issue its own organizational and service regulations whenever it considers it appropriate. That said, it is false to claim that for it to do so it needs the trade union or the collective agreement (which has been in force for decades) to disappear, since they are not mutually exclusive and can perfectly well coexist. Section 103 of the General Public Administration Act stipulates that 鈥渢he hierarchically superior body shall, moreover, be the extrajudicial representative of the public administration within its sphere of competence and shall have the necessary authority to issue its own organizational and service regulations within and outside the administration, provided that, in such cases the regulations do not ultimately imply a power of decision over the general public鈥? As an autonomous state institution, the National Bank is thus empowered to issue general internal regulations in the interests of efficient management.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112002, response status: 200"

On this point, the management of the National Bank observes that 鈥渢he negotiations began in August 2009, and SEBANA appears not to understand (and says as much) that the collective agreement is a process of negotiation, of a meeting of minds and interests, in which the bank is obviously not obliged to agree with everything that SEBANA calls 鈥渋ts agreement鈥? The minutes of the Bargaining Committee show that the administration and the trade union have reached agreement on a very large portion of the issues dealt with in the agreement 鈥?the most critical, or controversial, issue being the administration鈥檚 proposal to introduce a new system of remuneration for new recruits known as the 鈥渢otal salary鈥? which will mean a substantial improvement for the bank鈥檚 new employees in that their salary will be more competitive in market terms without their having to accumulate many years of salary increments. To be quite clear, new employees will lose some of their rights in terms of days of annual leave, and their separation benefits will be reduced to the level stipulated in the Labour Code as well as other similar changes. But the bank鈥檚 proposal in no way obliges its current employees to switch to the new system of remuneration, nor does it limit their chances of promotion if they stay with the present system. Whether or not they changed their system of remuneration is entirely up to them, and the management of the bank has never had any other ambition than to enter into a process of negotiation in which it is essential to bear in mind the administration鈥檚 requirements for negotiating a new collective agreement. It is not imposing these requirements. They are simply the conceptual framework in which the bank intends to conduct its labour relations with its new employees, whereas SEBANA鈥檚 position is obviously that the bank should go along with its determination not to change anything in the present state of affairs, and that otherwise there can be no bargaining whatsoever, which is obviously not the way to proceed. The banking sector is governed by a set of standards and procedures that are designed to ensure that it is managed in a way that is in keeping with its assets and liabilities and with the concept of appropriate risk management. Negotiating a collective agreement is a process in which the parties discuss their positions and the outcome constitutes a meeting of minds. In all the bank鈥檚 previous negotiations, that outcome has been a marriage of what the administration wants and of what the workers鈥?representatives want, resulting in a collective agreement that is the property of neither the administration or SEBANA, but of the National Bank鈥檚 employees.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112002, response status: 200"

Workers currently employed by the bank have the option to join the new system of remuneration if it suits them, or to remain as they are, with all their acquired rights at the time. Employees recruited after the introduction of the 鈥渢otal salary鈥?would inter alia be entitled to different annual leave and separation benefits which, although higher than those stipulated in the country鈥檚 labour legislation, are indeed lower than those to which the bank鈥檚 present employees are entitled. The essential point here is that this is all part and parcel of the bargaining process and, if some mid-point between the positions of the respective parties can be found, a new collective agreement will be concluded. But it is clearly unacceptable that the bank should be obliged to sign 鈥淪EBANA鈥檚 agreement鈥?鈥?to use the union鈥檚 own words. The bank鈥檚 proposal would allow it to recruit its new personnel at a salary level more in keeping with average salaries on the market, without new employees having to wait for years to reach that point. Its principal objective is to offer a more attractive salary for newly recruited officials, without in any way modifying the individual conditions of existing officials, who would be entitled to maintain the salary conditions to which they are currently entitled.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112002, response status: 200"

Thus, each worker currently employed by the bank has the option to stay with the system of remuneration that is currently in force. For the bank to seek to regulate the conditions of recruitment of new employees does not violate any human right; it is simply exercising the obligation imposed on the institution鈥檚 administrators to maintain a system of remuneration that ensures the competitiveness of the salaries it pays in the sector within which it operates. The position adopted by SEBANA towards what it calls an illegal lowering conditions of remuneration is significant, since in the past it has gone along with the need to limit certain rights for new employees, as happened when annual leave was reduced from 30 to 20 days with the entry into force of the current collective agreement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3112002, response status: 200"

On the contrary, that is precisely one of the rights to which employees opting for the total salary will be entitled, as it is a valuable institutional tool for monitoring the performance and management targets of the bank鈥檚 employees and its various offices. That said, what the National Bank does want is that profit-sharing among its employees should be calculated after deduction of the contributions that the bank is legally bound to make, since it would not be appropriate to calculate the amount to be distributed before the necessary payments required by law have been made.

The new collective agreement also empowers the Board to rule on labour issues within its purview.

That was why it made certain recommendations to Mar铆aelena Rodr铆guez Samuels, Secretary-General of FEBAS, so that it could proceed with the Federation鈥檚 registration. In February 2010, according to the Government, officials of the Department of Social Organizations spoke directly with Rodr铆guez Samuels, who explained that she had made a mistake, as her intention had never been to request the establishment of the Federation for the first time, but to recover its legal personality, which had lapsed (as stated in the communication of 2 March 2010).

SINTRAJAP鈥檚 previous executive board raised the issue at a union assembly, which rejected the proposal and demanded US$500,000 per employee, which the Government authorities rejected as unreasonable and disproportionate. Subsequently, the Government raised its offer to 2.7 million colones per year under contract up to a maximum of 20 years.

In two or three weeks the Government will be putting a new dock in Lim贸n out to tender. In the words of the Minister of Transport, this will be the first shot in a battle that is going to last all year and one of whose aims is to get rid of the dockworkers鈥?union in the Caribbean. The Minister met with representatives of the chamber of employers and told them in the harshest terms that it was a war in which no quarter would be shown.

The Committee points out that the allegations emphasize the interference of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and Ministry of Health. According to the complainants, the latter suspended one of the assemblies called by SINTRAJAP鈥檚 legitimate executive board because the venue did not meet requirements and agreed to the mediator group holding an assembly (attended by only 286 of the 1,500 members of the union) which thereupon appointed a spurious executive committee that the Ministry of Labour promptly registered. The Committee observes that the Government offers a very different version of events, according to which the venue chosen (150 square metres) was too small for over 1,000 participants and that, in accordance with the relevant regulations and at the request of a member of SINTRAJAP (from the mediator group), the Minister of Health raised an objection to the venue in the interests of public health and recommended that the assembly not be held there, but did not suspend the assembly. In the Government鈥檚 view, the problem stemmed from a dispute between a number of union members (according to the Government, the second assembly was attended by 550 union members and was convened because the union鈥檚 executive board had not informed the workers of the employer鈥檚 second offer of compensation for dismissal) and the new executive board, and the authorities were not involved in the assemblies. The Government makes the point that the Ministry of Labour 鈥?which is not empowered to act as an administrative police force 鈥?registered the agreements submitted to it but later cancelled the registration of the new executive board following the ruling of the judicial authority. Thus, the Government is of the view that the problem that was at the heart of the complaint has been resolved.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912298, response status: 200"

SIBANPO alleges that, because of its active role in trade union affairs, the union and its leaders have for some time been confronted by a series of arbitrary anti-union and discriminatory measures that have been backed or perpetrated by the employers鈥?representatives of Banco Popular, including the general manager, in attempts to undermine and destabilize the trade union. These anti-union measures have taken many different forms: persecution of union officials, harassment, arbitrary disciplinary sanctions, unjustified denial of leave to carry out union activities, the bringing of baseless criminal charges against them by higher institutional bodies, unlawful administrative requirements, denial of freedom of expression, etc. Specifically, SIBANPO alleges that its requests for paid trade union leave, as provided for in the collective agreement so that some of its members can assist in training activities and other strictly union activities, have been denied without any ground for doing so (Human Development and Organizational Directorate communications (ref. Nos DDHO-047-2009 of 20 January 2009, DDHO-541-2009 of 16 June 2009, DDHO-432-2009 of 13 May 2009 and DDHO-640-2009 of 14 July 2009), copies of which were attached).

As the article pointed out, 鈥渢he internal auditor of Banco Popular, with the authorization of its management board, engaged the services of two private detectives to investigate recent 鈥渓eaks鈥?to the press.鈥?The article went on to state that one of the detectives, a former agent of the Judicial Police Assault Force, had been convicted of abuse of authority and has been one of the defendants in a case concerning the death of an alleged gangster who died a few hours after being arrested and taken to judicial police headquarters (a copy of La Naci贸n of 7 July 2007 was attached).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912180, response status: 200"

The management鈥檚 demands are altogether unacceptable, for the following reasons:(a) Regarding the demands that the union reimburse funds that have been transferred to it, the Bank鈥檚 repeated demands are quite clearly inadmissible as they are based on irregular operational rules that were modified unilaterally without the union being consulted or even informed at any time.(b) Regarding the reimbursement of 3 million colones (CRC), it has been clearly shown that the sum was spent on the professional services of an expert who provided training for the employees of Banco Popular on matters of interest to the Bank (restructuring, draft Development Bank Act). The purpose for which these funds 鈥?which at the time had been duly authorized by the general manager himself 鈥?were used is altogether in conformity with the rules and regulations laid down in section 72 of the collective agreement.(c) As to the other funds whose reimbursement is being demanded, these were earmarked for activities conducted at the end of 2005 in several of the Bank鈥檚 offices. In 2007, funds were transferred at the end of the year to SIBANPO, which it spent on cultural and sporting events, but the administration again decided to change the rules for their use without consulting or even informing the union.

Ms Chavarr铆a Marchena requested union leave on 10 March 2009 to attend a training course in her area of activity but was informed on 18聽March by her superiors that leave was not granted because she was required to finish some prior work. Following a further request, explanations were given of the work-related reasons for the refusal. On 26 March, Ms Chavarr铆a reported being incapacitated for health reasons as of that day, and until 2 April, and on 27 March she attended the training course for which she had requested leave.Given these facts, a minimum of reasoning ability would suggested that further scrutiny was warranted in order to corroborate the truth or otherwise of the reported incapacity. Even if her health were known to be poor, the compatibility of the latter with her attendance at the course would be questionable. The Bank decided to report what had happened to the preliminary commission to enable it to ascertain whether or not there was sufficient evidence to justify disciplinary proceedings. The preliminary commission is an internal bipartite body created under the collective agreement concluded with the complainant organization and has the mandate, as its title suggests, of carrying out preliminary investigations into reports of contraventions of labour agreements and standards with a view to determining whether there is insufficient evidence to justify disciplinary proceedings against a Bank employee. Once the commission had been briefed on the case at an ordinary session No. 20-2009 on 17 June 2009, its members decided unanimously to order the establishment of a steering body for proceedings against Ms Chavarr铆a Marchena. The unanimous decision was thus also supported by the vote of the SIBANPO representative, that is, Ms Chavarr铆a鈥檚 own trade union colleague, who was the nominated representative of the complainant organization鈥檚 Secretary-General. That the complainant union should accuse its own representative of an anti-union act is absurd.In addition, on 23 July this year, the Steering Body for the Administrative Proceedings set a date by which Ms Chavarr铆a could submit such evidence as she might consider appropriate for her defence, and she also had the right to attend the hearing accompanied by a union representative. Until such time as the proceedings are concluded, it will not be possible to know with certainty whether there was any misconduct or what the appropriate sanction, if any, would be, but the procedure adopted for the investigation is governed by the General Law on Public Administration, which guarantees citizens due process and the constitutional right of defence.The same procedure applied with regard to the warning issued to Ms Chavarr铆a for reportedly accessing Internet sites unrelated to her work; as was reported in official communication No. DDHO-393-2009 dated 30 April 2009, when the report was received from the Bank鈥檚 Information Technology Department, she was given the opportunity to formulate her defence after the contents of the report referring to her had been passed on, the evidence was examined, and finally the appropriate sanction was imposed, as is the case with any other employee of the Bank who commits the same offence.It is generally understood that with banks, IT security is far more delicate and requires more stringent preventive checks than are considered usual in other forms of economic activity.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912180, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that many of the alleged incidents have been submitted to the judicial authorities and that the criminal charges brought against the union鈥檚 leaders have been dismissed, namely: (1) a criminal charge against the Secretary-General alleging the use of funds transferred to the union by the Bank for purposes other than those provided for in the collective agreement 鈥?rejected by decision of the judicial authority on 7 September 2009; and (2) a criminal charge brought by the Bank鈥檚 representatives against the same union leader for libel, injury and defamation 鈥?dismissed by the judicial authority in its ruling of 6 October 2008, and again on appeal on 28 August 2009, on the grounds that she was exercising her right as a union leader to express her views on a public matter implicating the Bank. As regards point (1), the Committee notes the statements made by the Bank鈥檚 general management to the effect that the criminal charge against the union鈥檚 Secretary-General was made when the internal audit office found evidence of apparent irregularities perpetrated by the union official in the use of the public funds in question, which had been transferred under section 72 of the collective agreement; unjustified failure to meet the obligations in respect of internal auditing is a matter of administrative responsibility for the employer under the terms of the General Internal Audit Act; the resulting complaint thus has no anti-union objective and was not upheld by the judicial authority. As regards the charge against the same union official for libel, injury and defamation, the Committee notes that according to the Bank鈥檚 management, the charge was made by a colleague of the official in question in an attempt to obtain redress for what he considered to be an attack on his honour, and not by the Bank鈥檚 management, which has confirmed that the charge was rejected by the judicial authority. Taking into account the judicial rulings which did not uphold the two criminal charges in question, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912180, response status: 200"

Moreover, the Committee believes that, the constant resort to the courts to resolve disputes between the union and the Bank deriving from the lodging of criminal charges 鈥?even though the charges against the union were dismissed 鈥?has deteriorated relations between the parties concerned, because of the length of the judicial proceedings (two years), and has hampered the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee suggests that the complainant organization and the Bank consider the possibility of setting up a joint committee under the collective agreement to verify periodically the legality of the activities financed by funds whose management the collective agreement assigns to the trade union. The Committee requests the Government to pass on this recommendation to the complainant trade union and to the Bank and to keep it informed of any development in this regard.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912180, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that, according to the Bank鈥檚 management, 89.10 per cent of leave requests were granted, and refusals were justified on work-related grounds rather than being for any anti-union motives. The Committee emphasizes in this regard that it is not in a position to verify whether or not in each specific case the Bank鈥檚 refusal to grant trade union leave conformed to the terms of the collective agreement. Consequently, the Committee suggests that disputes over trade union leave provided for in the collective agreement be submitted to a joint committee, which could be presided over by an independent personality so as to ensure that SIBANPO can in practice use its right to union leave under the collective agreement without prejudice to the smooth running of the Bank.

The Committee notes the Government鈥檚 statement to the effect that, according to the management of the Bank, the trade union leave requested on 10 March 2009 for the purpose of attending a training course in the worker鈥檚 area of competence could not be granted because the worker in question had to complete some prior work. Subsequently, according to the Bank, she reported sick, but on the following day attended the training course, and administrative proceedings against her were therefore initiated by a unanimous decision of an internal tripartite commission which included a vote in favour of that measure by the representative of the complainant organization, who had been nominated by the union official. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the aforementioned administrative proceedings.

According to the company, as African and Caribbean countries have increased their share of banana production since 2000, competition from a number of Latin American countries and a fall in productivity of Costa Rica鈥檚 banana plantations have all led to increasing pressure to improve productivity in the country鈥檚 plantations. This has led to modernization programmes, involving production control based on the use of cuttings and new planting with a view to restoring productivity. According to the company, both SITAGAH and the Coordinating Committee were informed of this situation before the measures were put into effect. Currently, there are unionized workers working on the plantation in areas not affected by the modernization programmes of 2009. The company states that it has openly offered work on the plantation to workers laid off in connection with the modernization programme but the offer was not accepted by the union, despite the fact that work had already resumed in those areas. The company emphasizes that, despite this offer, none of the complainants has applied to the plantation for work, which proves that there is no foundation to the allegations of anti-union harassment made by SITAGAH. According to the company, the unionized worker Filem贸n Vel谩squez Rayo is working on the plantation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912071, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Constitutional Court in its jurisprudence has consistently stated that trade union immunity is not unlimited, and union officials can therefore be dismissed if there is good reason, in accordance with labour legislation and the principles of due process.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912071, response status: 200"

The Government adds that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice refused the appeal for protection (amparo) filed by Mr Salas Sark铆s against his dismissal. The Government sends the ruling which states the following with regard to the substance of the case:The appellant (Mr Salas Sark铆s) claims that due process was violated in three ways. Firstly, management is trying to dismiss him although he has not committed any wrongdoing in the exercise of his post, as the actions attributed to him were carried out in his role as a trade unionist. According to the final report of the panel that conducted the disciplinary proceedings, the Institute, in its dealings with the defendant, granted several instances of trade union leave with pay so that Alicia Vargas Obando could participate in trade union activities, although in reality the leave was used for other activities. This Chamber considers that determining if this was committed in the role of a trade union member or in another capacity is a matter outside the authority of a constitutional court. This was in fact at the very core of the discussion during the administrative proceeding. Consequently, the appellant鈥檚 opposition to decisions arising from the administrative proceeding must be channelled through existing administrative appeals. Secondly, in the factual report above, it was proven that the transfer of charges was done in a valid way, given that Mr Sark铆s knew about the charges against him, the legislation that was infringed and his rights in the administrative proceeding initiated against him. Lastly, the defendant may exercise his right to defence by giving notice of the appeals provided for by the legal system. He took part in the private oral hearing, where he had the opportunity to question the witnesses more than once and actively defend his rights. Once again, the grounds and proportionality between the offence and the penalty are set out as part of the disciplinary proceeding itself, or possibly as part of industrial proceedings. Contrary to what the appellant appears to assume, there is no constitutional right to a less serious penalty. For these reasons, the appellant鈥檚 reservations cannot be considered as having any grounds, which is why the appeal is dismissed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2911106, response status: 200"

Despite the fact that approval is still pending for the these bills, in which the highest authorities of the country are showing interest, when analysing the delay in the approval of the bills, on which the Committee of Experts was consulted, the events in the country in recent years have to be taken into consideration. In the first place, on 7 October 2007, in a binding referendum, the Free Trade Agreement concluded by Central America, the Dominican Republic and the United States was approved. With the implementation of this Agreement, the Members of Parliament embarked on the examination, discussion and approval of a series of bills which had to be tabled alongside the Treaty and which formed an additional legislative agenda. These bills took up the attention of the Members of Parliament until the end of 2008 in both their ordinary and extraordinary sessions. In brief, the long discussions on the Free Trade Agreement and the approval of the additional laws delayed examination of the reforms to labour procedures and compliance with the Agreement of the Higher Labour Council of October 2006.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

In this respect, Costa Rica is no exception and this situation is even having an impact on the order in which draft legislation is examined by the Legislative Assembly, which is currently engaged in the examination of the bills tabled under the 鈥淓scudo Plan鈥?presented by the President of the Republic. The Escudo Plan does not constitute a reform of the Labour Code, but consists of a series of temporary measures, the principal objective of which is social protection and economic stimulus in the face of the international crisis. The Plan is based on four pillars, which are the beneficiaries of the Government鈥檚 measures: families, workers, enterprises and the financial sector. One of the components of the Plan is Bill No. 17315 on the protection of labour in times of crisis, which provides for the possibility of the conclusion of an agreement between employers and workers under which, in the light of the crisis, enterprises undertake to reduce the number of hours worked by their employees, without reducing the value of the hour not performed by the worker, on condition that there are no dismissals. Managers and high-level executives are also urged to reduce their salaries.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

The Bill is currently going through the legislative process of being discussed and examined. Alongside the Bill, it is intended to promote telework in private enterprises, which will offer major benefits for the public sector, as it involves a reduction in costs. Enterprises will accordingly have to consider reducing costs through this system before cutting back their staff. In addition to these measures, it is planned to implement a programme of grants to train 5,000 workers in enterprises affected by the crisis with a view to encouraging enterprises not to reduce their payroll, but to keep their employees on and at the same time train them in fields such as English, computer skills and the management of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

This response is based on two principal approaches: the first is from the viewpoint of the supply of decent work, and the second from the viewpoint of the demand for decent work. The first element proposes the promotion of productive activities by refocusing on the socio鈥損roductive function of the financial system, guaranteed security and food sovereignty, as well as agricultural employment. A system of conditional transfers is also established to promote decent work by minimizing dismissals for economic reasons and promoting social, labour and environmental investment. As these initiatives are intended to mitigate the negative impact of the global economic crisis in the various sectors of the national economy, they require the attention of the Members of Parliament for their examination and rapid implementation, which makes it necessary to leave aside temporarily the examination and approval of other draft legislation, including the bills relating to the effectiveness and rapidity of protection procedures against anti-union discrimination and for collective bargaining in the public sector.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

With regard to the progress of the various bills in the Legislative Assembly, it should be noted that Bill No. 13475 to reform various sections of the Labour Code, of Act No. 2 of 27 August 1943, and sections 10, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of Decree No. 832 of 4 November 1949, and their amended texts, is near the top of the agenda of the Legislative Plenary. Bill No. 15990 to reform labour procedures is currently being examined by a subcommittee set up by the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly and it is hoped that it will be tabled during the ordinary sessions to be held from May to October 2009.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

It is the outcome of a broad consultation process set in motion by the Supreme Court of Justice. It has benefited from the financial support of the Government of Canada and from ILO technical assistance. Emphasis should be placed on the participation of titular and substitute magistrates of the Second Chamber, labour judges, law professionals specializing in labour law, officials of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, representatives of employers鈥?chambers and of trade unions, among others. The Bill addresses the subject of the slowness of procedures in the case of anti-union action and strengthens the right to collective bargaining in the public sector. Essentially, it seeks to simplify judicial procedures and make them more rapid, including those relating to anti-union acts, by replacing written proceedings by oral hearings, as well as strengthening the application in practice of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector and reinforcing protection against anti-union acts.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

This was done so that the comments by ILO experts were taken into consideration in the analysis of the Bill. The bill respecting the negotiation of collective agreements in the public sector, and the addition of subsection 5 to section 112 of the General Act on the Public Administration, is being examined by the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs of the Legislative Assembly.

On various occasions, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been informed of the comments received from the Second Chamber and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. In the present case, the comments are being forwarded that were received from the current President on 15 April 2009. The President of the Second Chamber transmitted his observations to the Office of the President of the Supreme Court of Justice on 31 March 2009. In his communication he indicated, with regard to the principle of collective bargaining, that the Supreme Court of Justice has endeavoured to achieve its effective implementation through legal provisions which make it possible and practicable in reality. In this respect, reference is made to the Bill to reform labour procedures, with the indication that the Bill has not received the agreement of the social organizations in relation to certain provisions, including those relating to the percentage of workers required to call a strike and engage in protest action. He adds that he held a meeting with the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs (where the Bill is currently being examined), with a view to determining the bills of interest to the judicial authorities, and on that occasion the Bill to reform labour procedures was included as a priority.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

These efforts include the allocation of increased human resources to the labour courts, as well as strengthening the operation of the courts through the extension of electronic links with external institutions, such as the CCSS, the INS and the Public Registry, with a view to facilitating judicial processes in labour procedures, and the purchase of digital recording equipment for use in oral hearings. Emphasis should be placed on the establishment of smaller labour tribunals in various areas of the country with a view to accelerating procedures, particularly as the rules governing these services are characterized by the principle of oral proceedings. It is hoped that these decisions will contribute to improving the service in this jurisdiction and that users can have their cases settled in a more appropriate time period. The Government adds that a workshop was successfully held on 2聽June 2009 in the Legislative Assembly on 鈥淭he Impact of the Reform of Labour Procedures鈥? The most important conclusions of this activity concern the importance of focusing discussion on the Bill to reform labour procedures on the points of divergence in the social sectors so as to make progress in its examination, thereby guaranteeing access to justice as a human right.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910375, response status: 200"

The Committee notes the Government鈥檚 indication that: (1) the case of Mr Teodoro Mart铆nez Mart铆nez is before the Labour Court, Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos茅; the grounds for his dismissal were that he addressed his immediate chief in an unruly and disrespectful manner on 8 April 2006 during working hours, and that in August 2008 the determination of the date of the hearing for conciliation and the submission of evidence was awaited; (2) the case of Mr聽Amado D铆az Guevara is before the Labour Court, Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos茅; the grounds for dismissal were the failure to comply with contractual obligations in the work of the plantation, causing prejudice to the plantation; he also failed to inform his immediate superior of the true situation by claiming that the assigned work had been carried out; the ruling of the court of first instance upheld the charges and an appeal has been lodged with the Labour Tribunal; and (3) the case of Mr Ricardo Saturnino Peck Montiel is before the Labour Court, Second Judicial Circuit of San Jos茅; the grounds for dismissal were the repeated failure to follow the established procedures for the protection of the fruit; the latest decision by the judicial office in relation to the action brought by the party was on 6 January 2009; in this respect, the Committee regrets the long period that has elapsed since the commencement of the current court proceedings without rulings being handed down up to now.

During its visit, the mission took note of the formal request by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for ILO assistance in conducting an independent inquiry into the issue. To carry out this task, the ILO appointed Adri谩n Gold铆n, Professor of Labour Law at the University of San Andr茅s (Argentina) in February 2007. The Government of Costa Rica, acting through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, cooperated fully, providing all the logistical and technical support requested by Mr Gold铆n. In May 2008, the Government of Costa Rica received a copy of the study carried out by the independent expert appointed by the CEACR, to which it had agreed during the visit of the ILO high-level mission to the country. In this regard, the Government reiterates that, even if it might be claimed that there are a wide variety of factors conducive to the existence of more direct settlements than collective agreements, as noted by the CEACR, the fact is that both institutions have a basis in law and are freely chosen by the sectors involved.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910372, response status: 200"

Once all the plants allotted for each plot have been planted, this work is no longer carried out.

On 3 September 2003 (long before he joined the trade union) this worker had received a written reprimand for physically and verbally assaulting Mr Mora Mora Gerardo, while he was doing his job. This constituted grounds for dismissal, but the enterprise only issued a reprimand (section 81(a) of the Labour Code). On 24 May 2005, he was again issued with a warnings for leaving his post. On 1 and 24 April 2006, he was given written warnings for having abandoned his post. These acts constitute grounds for dismissal under sections 72(a) and 81(y) of the Labour Code, but the enterprise did not dismiss the worker.

The Government of Costa Rica cooperated fully, providing all the logistical and technical support requested by Mr Gold铆n, and received his report in May 2008; (4) even if it might be claimed that there are a wide variety of factors conducive to the existence of more direct settlements than collective agreements, it is true that both institutions have a basis in law and are freely chosen by the sectors involved; however, owing to its constitutional status and its important role in maintaining social peace, collective bargaining is given special protection; (5) should it be found that a trade union recognized for bargaining purposes already exists in the enterprise, the General Labour Inspectorate shall reject the direct settlement immediately, without assessing its content, so as not to undermine the collective bargaining process; (6) it is true that the independent expert refers to circumstances which would appear to contradict the commitment under Article 4 of Convention No. 98. Accordingly, and taking into account the recommendation of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has sent a complete copy of the study to each of the members of the High Labour Council; and (7) the Government continues to hope that a satisfactory solution will be found through genuine social dialogue, involving all the social actors concerned, in order to ensure that permanent committees and direct settlements do not have an anti-union impact in practice. In this regard, the Committee appreciates the fact that the Government has submitted this issue to the competent authorities and to a tripartite body, and expects that the measures planned by the Government will enable appropriate solutions to be found to the problem of collective agreements with non-unionized workers.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910372, response status: 200"

As to the measures previously adopted by the authorities, the Committee took note of these in its previous conclusions which are reproduced below in order to clarify the situation [see 348th Report, para.434]:The Committee notes the Government's statements, according to which (1) the Government does not endorse the actions of the Office of the Ombudsperson nor of other political parties in challenging collective agreements, even if they are entitled to do so; (2) the Constitutional Chamber's decisions have not been drafted in full, only the operative paragraphs exist, but they suggest that voting was divided; (3) the Government's analysis process makes it clear that the full text of the rulings is required in order to avoid falling into speculation and subjective interpretations; (4) the Government has indicated the ILO鈥檚 position and its principles to the Constitutional Chamber; and (5) the Government has demonstrated its will to ensure collective bargaining in the public sector as an institution. The Government attaches communications from the heads of enterprises and institutions affected by the annulment of particular clauses in their collective agreements. There is a particular unease emanating from these communications, especially since the agreements had been set before the Committee on Policies for Collective Bargaining in the public sector at the time in order to have technical support, although they do point out that they must abide by the Constitutional Chamber's rulings and the separation of powers principle. The Committee observes the Government's request that its statements and arguments made in previous cases also be included. The Committee summarizes the Government's previous statements in earlier cases as follows: (1) the Government possesses the will and commitment to resolve the problems; (2) it has requested the ILO鈥檚 technical assistance in the hope that this will help to solve the problems mentioned; (3) the efforts of the Government (many of which were tripartite) regarding these problems included the presentation of several legislative proposals to the Legislative Assembly and their reactivation: a draft constitutional amendment concerning article 192, a bill on collective bargaining in the public sector, and the addition of paragraph 4 to article 112 of the General Law on Public Administration (the three initiatives are intended to strengthen collective bargaining in the public sector); bill on parliamentary approval of ILO Conventions Nos 151 and 154; the draft revision of various sections of the Labour Code, Act No. 2 of 26 August 1943 and Decree No. 832 of 4 November 1949; (4) the Government's efforts also include other types of initiatives, such as the intervention of third parties to defend collective agreements (coadyuvancia) in legal actions of unconstitutionality brought in order to annul specific clauses.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910143, response status: 200"

However, this has not prevented a study from being undertaken within the Higher Labour Council (a national tripartite body) into a bill on collective bargaining in the public sector, in the context of the reform of working procedures; (3) on 19 February 2008 the Minister of Labour formally requested the Minister of the Presidency to speed up work on all bills contributing to the strengthening of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, including the bills of ratification for the abovementioned ILO Conventions Nos 151 and 154; (4) in a follow-up to the recommendations of the high-level mission, and under the auspices of the ILO, a seminar was organized on 13 March 2008 on the issue of collective bargaining to which were invited, among others, the social partners, the heads and bodies of the various branches of government affected by the issue, including Supreme Court judges and members of parliament, as well as their assistants and advisers, in order to disseminate the principles of the ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2910143, response status: 200"

The Committee expects that the judicial authority will issue a ruling on the dismissal of the trade union officials of the ATF without delay, given that over eight and a half years have passed since the dismissals took place and requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling as soon as it is issued.(b) As to the entry effected by employees of FERTICA into the trade union office of the AFT and requisitioning of documents and goods, the Committee deplores the fact that representatives of the enterprise FERTICA unilaterally and without prior warning or consent entered into the office of the ATF trade union and relocated it to other premises belonging to the enterprise. The Committee requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling to be handed down as a consequence of the legal process undertaken by the Ministry of Labour for unfair employment practices and expects that the ruling will be handed down in the near future, restitution will be made for the damages and the ATF trade union will have its possessions returned to it.(c) The Committee requests the Government to communicate a copy of the ruling dated 8 April 2001, handed down by the Lower Small Claims Court of Puntarenas.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2908925, response status: 200"

The ICFTU explains that the Government established a dialogue process with the unions and civil society and, as a result, signed an act of negotiation on 31 May 2003 in which it committed to fulfilling various points, including compliance with the current collective agreement between SINTRAJAP and JAPDEVA. As three months after signing the act of agreement the Government had not complied with its commitment to respect the current collective agreement, and this added to the threat of cancelling the rights of the union members covered by the collective agreement, workers affiliated to SINTRAJAP exercised their right to strike, in accordance with national law, on 16 September 2003.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2908251, response status: 200"

This act does not contain labour demands; it was signed between trade union organizations, civil organizations and government representatives and was drawn up within the framework of strengthening constructive dialogue, with the aim to deal with the needs of various social and economic sectors of the province of Lim贸n, in accordance with the economic means of the Government of the Republic.

The motives of the strike were nothing to do with defending labour rights and the Government made every effort to take all measures necessary to fulfil the agreements reached (in its response the Government lists numerous measures, procedures and efforts relating to the agreements). Between making the agreements and the start of the strike, the authorities maintained dialogue and agreement and even asked the religious authorities to intervene to help get the search for shared solutions back on track. It is not true that the Ministry of Labour asked the enterprise JAPDEVA to bring an action for the strike to be declared illegal. The enterprises JAPDEVA and RECOPE requested the ruling and the judicial authority (in the first and second instance) declared the strike illegal as it involved public services essential for the economic life of the country, whose paralysis causes significant serious and immediate damage to certain goods. The judicial authority found that the strike action was not intended to protect the economic interests of the unionized workers but rather that it was taking place as an act of solidarity for the adverse economic situation that the province of Lim贸n is going through which was not per se a situation affecting the whole workforce. Article 375 of the Labour Code states that strikes will not be permitted in the public services.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2908251, response status: 200"

However, in this case, no worker was dismissed because of the aforementioned illegal strike. The enterprise JAPDEVA merely lowered workers鈥?salaries from 15 to 19 September 2003, in accordance with the Freedom of Association Committee鈥檚 principle that salary deductions for days of strike gives rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles.

Neither did they evict the workers from their places of work (in fact they had not entered these places). The police action in some areas was due to disturbances or blockages of the public highway or where it was necessary to avoid damage to fuel storage plants. In these cases they cleared the areas and apprehended those responsible for the disturbances who were handed over to the Public Prosecutor鈥檚 Department. The police action was rational, restrained and proportionate and within the framework of the laws governing police behaviour (efforts of prevention, security and to conserve public order). The Government rejects the allegations that workers were beaten, leaving several workers injured. The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court allows the police to use harmless tear gas of the lowest level of irritation that does not have any side effects and does not warrant medical attention, when public safety, human life or the security of goods is affected.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2908251, response status: 200"

The Committee concludes that the act of agreement of 31 May 2003 constitutes an exercise of collective bargaining and therefore if the trade unions believe that it was not fully respected they had the right to call a strike to achieve that objective as long as essential services in the strict sense of the term are not involved.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2908251, response status: 200"

Thus, the matter is a private one concerning the complainant and the defendant and, as such, it would be necessary to request information from the complainant concerning the outcome of the proceedings. In other words, the INS is not a party to these judicial proceedings which restricts its access to the case files. Furthermore, with regard to the proceedings under labour law initiated by Mr. Rodolfo Jim茅nez Morales against the INS, the ordinary proceedings are at the first instance stage, the demonstration phase, during which the various means of proof furnished by both parties and/or requested by the judge are admitted. Given that in cases involving labour issues, evidence can be furnished until such a time as the court is ready to pass judgement, and that the other party is informed of this evidence and can refer to it, the proceedings have taken a very long time.

According to ANDAS, the political machinations of the INS, using the President鈥檚 Office and the Attorney-General鈥檚 Office of the Republic led, in a fraudulent evasion of applicable law, to the employment relationship of those workers being considered a commercial relationship, leaving the insurance brokers unprotected with regard to their social rights and guarantees (health insurance, pension and life insurance).

ANDAS indicates that it lodged a judicial complaint against the INS in April 2001, but the proceedings may take years and further legal action for violation of the entire collective agreement. ANDAS indicates that the reason that the insurance brokers accepted, in August 2002, partial payment of their rights to severance pay was because the INS left them no alternative.

The reorganization of the INS hoped to tackle increasing competitiveness in the field of insurance, insure the sustainability and the increase of sales and achieve better management of client services, providing services to those insured at lower intermediary costs, create a framework for monitoring and control and modernize the regulatory framework of insurance activities.

Independent of the complaint of trade union harassment and unfair labour practices lodged by the CMTC, the labour inspectors carried out an inspection of the PROPOKODUSA workplace on 8 October 2002 and were told, among other things, about offences involving excessive working hours, prohibited working hours, compulsory minimum rest and the minimum wage. In addition, according to the workers, when asked who was a member of a union, none of them replied in the affirmative.

On that occasion they spoke separately with trade union representatives and made the first moves to bring about a conciliation meeting. They returned to the factory on 29 July 2002, to urge a conciliation meeting between the trade union and the company. On that date, the dismissal of 37 workers took place and they were paid termination entitlements. A police patrol at the factory gates was observed. On 1 August 2002, a conciliation meeting was convened by the Office of the Vice-Minister of Labour, attended by the Vice-Minister and the Director-General of Labour Affairs, to seek a solution to the dispute between the trade union and the company. At the meeting, the parties reiterated their positions:鈥?PROPOKODUSA company: since 20 March 2002 the 82 workers in the processing plant had been notified of the company鈥檚 reorganization, consisting of hourly pay rather than piecework (for processed chicken) as had been the case until then and to work only eight hours, in compliance with labour legislation. On 12 July 2002, these workers were presented with a new personnel action with the changes in question. Anyone who did not accept the changes was dismissed with payment of their full labour entitlements. On 25 July 2002, they were called on to decide, summoned to the administration in groups of 20, and those who did not accept the new conditions were dismissed. The company continues to state that the trade union was formed during the reorganization process, and that they had no knowledge of the names of the members, although they did know the names of the leaders. In any case, all the workers were given the option of continuing to work and if the trade union leaders did not accept the new conditions, no one forced them to do so. Of the 82 workers affected by the reorganization (not the same number as the total workforce) 37 did not accept the new conditions, and were therefore given their letter of dismissal by the management. The company does not know if members were dismissed because it does not know their names.鈥?Trade Union Organization Movement of Costa Rican Workers: there is an industrial dispute in the company as a result of the dismissal of the executive committee of a trade union formed on 16 June 2002 and who are seeking reinstatement. On 26 July 2002, the trade union presented the company with an agenda for discussion, including, among other things, that workers were given five minutes to accept the new conditions or be dismissed. The workers鈥?organization seeks reinstatement, recognition of the trade union and the opening of negotiations.Other possible meetings between the parties, with the mediation of the Ministry of Labour, were ruled out because the company informed the Vice-Minister by telephone of its refusal to consider the points proposed by the trade union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2907413, response status: 200"

Also, at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour, an official of the multidisciplinary advisory team provided technical assistance to the leaders of the various parties in the legislature in connection with these Conventions. These initiatives were all intended to guarantee collective bargaining in the public sector. In addition, the government party in the Legislative Assembly on 10 May 2002 submitted a proposal to amend article 192 of the Constitution, which was the result of dialogue between the authorities and the trade union confederations. With the same objective, the executive branch submitted to the Legislative Assembly amendments to the General Public Administration Act, together with a draft law to introduce collective bargaining in the public sector which gives force of law to Decree No. 29576 of 31 May 2001.

The Government hopes that this plenary session will approve the draft law, which will allow ratification of Conventions Nos. 151 and 154. The new article will allow the granting of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector to public employees who are governed by the statute of civil servants and carry out public administration as representatives of the public authorities (upper-level management employees in public administration, such as members of executive boards of institutions, executive presidents, managers and heads of diplomatic missions; high-level supervisory employees for public finance, such as auditors, sub-auditors and the Comptroller-General of the Republic; employees in positions of trust, the Attorney-General of the Republic, the Council for Public Defence and employees of similar nature).

The Committee also notes that legislative bills to ratify ILO Conventions Nos. 151 and 154, which deal among other things with the right of collective bargaining in the public administration, have been submitted to the Legislative Assembly for approval. The Committee notes that the Committee of Experts has already expressed its views on the issue of collective bargaining in the public sector, as follows:The Committee notes that, according to the report of the technical assistance mission, there are good grounds for believing, including the opinion expressed by the President of the Constitutional Chamber, that the Chamber鈥檚 rulings Nos. 2000-04453 of 24 May 2000 and 2000-7730 of 30 August 2000, as well as the Chamber鈥檚 vote of clarification (No. 2000-09690) of 1 November 2000, totally exclude collective bargaining for all public sector employees with a statutory employment status, including those working in public or commercial enterprises or in independent public institutions. The Committee notes the action taken by the Government, in the context of this case law, to defend the right of collective bargaining in the public sector, and more particularly the recent Decree No. 29576-MTSS of 31 May 2001 (regulations for the negotiation of collective agreements in the public sector), which only excludes from this right public servants of the highest level in the public sector, and that the above regulations, in accordance with the recommendations of the technical assistance provided by the ILO, includes certain substantial improvements with regard to the 1993 regulations (for example, abolition of the approval commission, broadening the scope of application of the Convention, limitations on collective bargaining only for the public sector or its representatives) and which were the subject of certain comments by the technical assistance mission with a view to developing future legislation, in which emphasis was placed on certain problems and on the need to clarify certain points.Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the technical assistance mission, commenting on the above rulings of the Constitutional Chamber, ""emphasizes the confusion, uncertainty and even legal insecurity existing with regard to the scope of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector in terms of the employees and public servants covered (according to the rulings, the administration of the public institutions or enterprises is responsible for determining which employees have statutory status, and their decision may in turn be appealed to the judicial authorities) and in parallel concerning the validity and effect of certain collective agreements which are in force, as well as the constitutionality of the large number (according to the Government) of de facto negotiations existing, and even of the recent regulations respecting collective bargaining in the public sector of 31 May 2001. The mission also emphasizes that the ruling of 24 May 2000 indicates that it has retroactive effect"".The Committee expresses its deep concern over this situation, which constitutes a serious violation of Convention No. 98 in terms of the right to collective bargaining in the public sector, since the Convention only allows the exclusion from its application of public servants engaged in the administration of the State (Article 6). However, the Committee notes the existence of a Bill which is before the Legislative Assembly and is supported by the social partners and the Government, the President of the Legislative Assembly and the main opposition party, providing for the ratification of ILO Conventions Nos. 151 and 154 (which address, among other matters, the right of collective bargaining in the public administration) and which would make it possible to find solutions to the problems that exist and strengthen the application of Convention No. 98. It expresses the firm hope that it will be adopted in the very near future and requests the Government to provide information in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906043, response status: 200"

The Committee emphasizes the principle that: ""It is imperative that the legislation contain specific provisions clearly and explicitly recognizing the right of organizations of public employees and officials who are not acting in the capacity of agents of the state administration to conclude collective agreements. From the point of view of the principles laid down by the supervisory bodies of the ILO in connection with Convention No. 98, this right could only be denied to officials working in the ministries and other comparable government bodies but not, for example, to persons working in public undertakings or autonomous public institutions"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 1996, 4th edition, para. 795].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906043, response status: 200"

It is true that administrative disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him, for which a body was appointed to carry out the procedure in order to ascertain the truth of the matter, in accordance with the constitutional principle of due process, by an administrative decision issued on 13 July 1998. In this respect, it is important to point out that the acts which gave rise to the complaint and investigation are as follows: (1) failing in his duties as a public official by allowing, through his negligence and irresponsibility, more than 40 documents submitted for registration to the National Registry to be mislaid, these documents being in his custody and under his responsibility, since as a public official and as the ""right-hand man"" for sector 2-06 he was in charge at the time the documents were lost, and has not yet reported their whereabouts, displaying indifference to such a serious matter; (2) he also failed in his duties by allowing himself, in his position as official responsible for sector 2-06, to fall entirely behind with his work without having accounted for this so far, with the result that the Directorate of the Property Registry had to restructure this sector as a precautionary measure in view of the backlog; (3) failing to hand in a report as the official responsible for sector 2-06, on the mislaid documents and to report on their whereabouts before resigning on grounds of incompetence as he was duty-bound to do, especially since he was the official in charge when the abovementioned documents were lost. It is clear from the above that Mr. Mario Zamora Cruz was guilty of serious misconduct, which constituted the grounds for filing a petition for dismissal with the competent body, in this case the General Directorate of the Civil Service, which was received on 29 October 1998 as recorded in the case file.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905796, response status: 200"

The ICFTU adds that following a complaint by the union about this matter and also about the violation of other trade union and social rights, the enterprise dismissed Mr. Adri谩n Herrera Arias, general-secretary of the trade union, without taking into account his status of trade union leader. In addition, when the trade union presented a statement of claims, COBASUR refused to discuss it with the workers' legitimate representatives and set up a solidarity association, negotiating a direct settlement with a workers' committee it appointed itself which was advised by the solidarity members. The Ministry of Labour was informed about these events in two complaints submitted to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection. A further complaint was made concerning anonymous documents addressed to Mr. Adri谩n Herrera Arias, pressuring him to leave the trade union because his life was in danger, and also indicating that an entirely unidentified vehicle had tried to run him over once when he was walking along one of the roads in the plantation. His immediate reaction had been to throw himself into the trees which saved his life, causing only minor injury. Similarly, on 13 April 1999, after attending to some business on behalf of the workers, Mr. Herrera Arias was stopped in the road by two hooded men carrying guns who tied him by his hands and feet to a banana transport cable, brutally beat him and shot him on the left side of the chest. While they were beating him they warned him to leave the trade union and the banana plantation area; if not, his life and his family's lives would be in danger.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"
Case No 2024 (Costa Rica),27-Apr-99,The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246'],"551.Furthermore, in its communications dated 21 May and 29 June 1999, the ICFTU refers to the following events which it considers demonstrate that the Ministry of Public Education is violating trade union freedoms in clear breach of ILO Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 135:-- The members of the National Executive Council of the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union (SEC) are being refused leave to attend Council sessions. On 9 December 1998, a note was sent to the Ministry of Labour to inform it about the silence of the Ministry of Public Education in respect of the requests for leave made on 4 November for the members of the National Executive Council. This Council is made up of representatives from the country's various regional structures and meets every Friday and Saturday. Official letter reference DGP 4938-98, signed by the Director of the Personnel Department of the Ministry of Public Education, informs the Minister of Public Education that the requests for leave made by the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union for the members of the National Executive Council were approved by the Director and had therefore already been processed and communicated. In addition, in official letter reference DTM 0026-99, dated 11 January 1999, the Minister of Labour states that in accordance with related conversations, this matter had been favourably resolved. However, no specific communication by the Minister of Public Education granting the leave in question was ever made.-- On 26 April 1999, a personal memorandum was addressed to the Minister of Labour and Social Security reiterating the ongoing violation occurring with regard to requests for trade union leave of absence. He was asked to order, in accordance with prevailing regulations, the Ministry of Public Education not to infringe the right to freedom of association. There has been no response to this request.-- On 8 March 1999, in official letter DVM 477-99 the Deputy Minister of Public Education sent to the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union the authorization to conduct regional assemblies scheduled throughout that year. As a result of this authorization all related scheduling and preparatory work for these regional assemblies was carried out. However, without any warning or consultations the Deputy Minister of Public Education revoked the circular through official letter reference DVM dated 22 April 1999. He granted leave for only 23 April 1999, leaving the entire scheduled programme in the lurch. Then, in official letter DVM 971-99, dated 10 May 1999, the Deputy Minister of Public Education refused a request for leave of absence to carry our regional assemblies and trade union activities.-- In official letter reference DVM 962-99, addressed to the President of the Costa Rican Education Workers' Union, the Deputy Minister of Public Education refused leave for caretakers to participate in trade union activities on 20 May 1999. However, the most serious part of the communication is contained in the following two paragraphs: ""In compliance with the Central American Agreement on the Basic Unification of Education, this Ministry has scheduled the 1999 school calendar to consist of an academic year of 200 days of teaching, with no provision for days off to hold assemblies of teachers' associations and trade unions or for their executive committees to meet during school hours."" And the most serious aspect of this note is the following statement: ""I must also point out that our legislation contains no provision granting trade union organizations the right to and consequently obliging this Ministry to issue, the requested leave."" With this statement the State of Costa Rica, through the Ministry of Public Education, is ignoring the existence of ILO Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 135, ratified by Costa Rica, which have a higher authority than the law, as established in article 7 of the Constitution which states: ""Public treaties, international agreements and concordats duly approved by the legislative assembly shall have a higher authority than the laws upon their enactment or from the day that they designate.""","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

Being the principal teachers' organization in the country, when it was first established it received the necessary support for its start-up and subsequent development, and legal provisions were established to ensure that it could carry out its trade union activities. In effect, the legislation setting up the ANDE guaranteed it the right to hold national congresses, thus promoting the necessary participation of its affiliates as an unquestionable element in its development. In this respect article 8 states: ""The Ministry of Public Education will grant paid leave to members who perform functions under its jurisdiction in order to attend the sessions of national teachers' congresses."" As teachers constitute a majority group of workers in the public service sector, the ANDE should carry out activities at the regional level in all the districts and provinces of Costa Rica in order to meet the need for information and training for teachers, not only with respect to their entitlements, but also to provide support for the development of education in Costa Rica.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

During these assemblies activities are carried out such as the election of representatives to the association's highest management bodies which are the central executive committee and the board of directors. Since its establishment, the ANDE has only held the minimum number of assemblies necessary to ensure its associates their rights of participation and election, which is why any appropriate time during the working day is used, and it has become a recurrent and accepted custom to grant absence of leave for such assemblies.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

Nevertheless, the representatives who come from the border zones and other faraway places must make the journey at least one day earlier, and therefore need leave to stop work earlier, but the Government, through the Deputy Minister of Public Education, expressly states that leave will not be granted to these representatives. The other ANDE management body is the board of directors, consisting of nine members, four of whom have unpaid leave to carry out their duties on a full-time basis, with the other five representatives requiring leave to participate in the sessions which are usually held on Friday afternoons; these five will also be affected by the Government's refusal to grant leave. But it is not only the ANDE and the SEC that have been denied leave to carry out their assemblies and trade union activities - the same thing has happened to administrative workers in the Costa Rican educational system, as in the case of the caretakers, when the Ministry of Public Education refused to grant leave to the organizations to which these workers belong, that is the National Caretakers' Union (UCEP) and the National Union of Caretakers in Public and Private Education (SINCOSEPP).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

During the negotiating process, the enterprise signed a direct settlement with a ""standing workers' committee"". Given the enterprise's refusal to continue dialogue with SITRASUR, the trade union representatives lodged a complaint for alleged unfair labour practices against the trade union on 9 June and 1 September 1998. The Government adds that in reports dated 25 August and 3 November 1998, the labour inspectorate established through administrative channels: (1) the unjustified dismissal of Mr. Adri谩n Herrera Arias and anti-union persecution against him; (2) direct interference by the enterprise administration in the establishment of the standing committee to the detriment of the union; (3) direct participation by the enterprise administration in the establishment of the standing committee to the detriment of SITRASUR. Consequently, the inspectorate lodged a complaint with the labour courts on 20 November 1998; the defendant did not appear and the final judgement is now being awaited as the case is in the final phase.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

Nevertheless, the labour inspectorate's report states that there is no proof of the attempt to run the trade union leader over nor of the shots fired at him, and certainly nothing about the enterprise's involvement in sending anonymous letters.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

Case No 2024 (Costa Rica),27-Apr-99,The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246'],"558.The Government indicates with regard to these allegations that Costa Rica, by way of Act No. 3726 of 16 August 1996, approved the so-called Central American Agreement on the Basic Unification of Education, article 25(7) of which establishes that the States formally agree to the following: ""The signatory States decide to establish a minimum of 200 days of actual classes per year with a working day of no less than five hours. Likewise, they must endeavour by all possible means, and as far as circumstances permit, gradually to eliminate non-stop, double-shift and alternate-attendance teaching."" The Constitutional Court has ratified the applicability, obligatory nature and priority of the agreement, which requires States to ensure adherence to an academic year of a minimum of 200 days. In compliance with the agreement, the Ministry of Education scheduled the 1999 school year to include 200 actual school days, with the school calendar not making provision for days to hold teacher association and union meetings, or for the executive committees of these bodies to conduct their sessions during school hours. Accepting the complaint made by the applicants would unavoidably imply repudiating the above agreement which has a higher authority than other national laws and therefore infringing upon the right of students to education, as a school year of less than 200 actual days of class would be forced upon them, which is an infringement of a right as fundamental as education. Legislation does not contain any regulation granting the right of trade union associations to the requested leave, and the consequent obligation of this Ministry to issue it, affecting the minimum length of the school year.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

The refusal to grant leave does not in any way infringe upon the right of unionization. This case comes down to the fact that, for legal reasons and on the grounds of the best interests of the student community and the supreme right to education, their assemblies cannot be held during school hours or on school days.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

On 22 June 1999 the parties signed an agreement under which, as from the 2000 academic year, the Ministry of Education will negotiate the school calendar with the teaching organizations, incorporating trade union activities and ensuring that the school year will be of a duration of no less than 200 actual days of class. The agreement also stipulated that during the 1999 academic year the Ministry would grant the necessary leave to attend national assemblies and executive committee sessions. In other words, following the submission of the complaint to the ILO, the Government of Costa Rica, turning once again to dialogue, managed to overcome the disparate views held on this issue.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

On 22 April 1999 the Deputy Minister of Labour revoked his own circular and granted leave for only 23 April 1999, stating that the Central American Agreement on the Basic Unification of Education contained a commitment to ensure 200 actual school days per school year and that legislation did not contain any provision granting the right to trade union leave (outside school hours). The complainant organization indicates that the National Teachers' Association (ANDE) - more specifically its board of directors and its national executive committee - as well as the organizations that group together the administrative staff in the public education sphere (for example, the National Caretakers' Union and the National Union of Public and Private Education Caretakers) are in a similar situation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

In addition, according to the Government there is no rule obliging the Ministry of Education to grant trade union leave, and trade union assemblies are internal union activities that can take place outside work hours without interrupting schooling. Nevertheless, the Committee observes the Government's information that the Ministry of Public Education and the trade unions reached an agreement on 22 June 1999 whereby as from the 2000 school year the Ministry will negotiate the school calendar with the trade union organizations, incorporating trade union activities and granting the necessary leave to attend national assemblies and sessions of executive committees. The Committee notes this information with interest. However, it must underline that, according to the complainant, trade union leave had been granted for some years as an established practice and had been withdrawn for the most part unilaterally and abruptly between December 1998 and the date of the above agreement, which was highly detrimental for the trade union organizations. It cannot but regret this measure, despite its temporary nature.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2905246, response status: 200"

Various forms of repression of trade union leaders and trade unionists are taking place, including the compiling of blacklists, dismissals without just cause, assigning of the most strenuous tasks in a discriminatory manner and prohibiting trade union leaders access to the plantations. Over 150 cases are pending before the judicial bodies (some take as long as three or four years) and 60 are awaiting the decision of the administrative authorities. Some of these cases relate to violations of trade union rights committed over three years ago. This implies a refusal to grant trade union organizations a rapid solution to violations of this kind, leading to the dismissal of the workers involved and a loss of interest in the procedures, particularly as a result of the blacklists exchanged by employers. Moreover, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has done nothing to remedy this situation in spite of the handing down of more than 13 legal decisions ordering them to do so. According to the IUF, the Ministry is ineffective and delays the processing of complaints of trade union persecution and unfair practices.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

(which belongs to Chiquita Brand). The decision to submit a legal instrument of this kind to the courts is due to the enterprise's refusal to recognize the trade union or to enter into any type of negotiations. As regards the initial results of this action, the Civil and Labour Court of First Instance of the Atl谩ntico-Lim贸n region upheld the grievance, giving the enterprise 24 hours to appoint its representatives for negotiations -- which constitutes a major achievement given its implications -- thereby obliging it to begin the negotiation process. Although the enterprise was notified by both the trade union and the courts of the submission of the grievance, it did not stop its harassment of the workers who had signed the list of claims, despite the fact that the Labour Court ordered them not to engage in any type of reprisals. Furthermore, as a preventive measure the trade union appealed to the Ministry of Labour not to authorize any type of direct arrangement proposed by the enterprise, permanent committee or solidarity associations. It also requested an official inspection of the plantation, citing a number of examples of disregard for workers, but surprisingly the results of this inspection were detrimental to the workers, maintaining that they did not have the necessary official documents and allowing the enterprise to use this to nullify the complaint. Most of the workers have worked up to six years for this enterprise and have never encountered this type of problem before. It is thought that the reason is because the workers subscribed to a collectively negotiated instrument, as in all the plantations located in Sixaola there are workers who fit the same description. Perhaps the enterprise's reaction explains why 100 per cent of the workers supported the socio-economic grievance. Most of the workers at Isla Grande are of Guaymie origin, coming from Panama but working in Costa Rica.-- In the plantations of the enterprise Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola S.A. (PAIS S.A.), owned by the National Banana Corporation which is supposedly the regulating body of the banana sector, and in which the State of Costa Rica is a shareholder, the workers are harassed by the enterprise management to resign their membership of the trade union. The enterprise's officials have used pressure and blackmail and in some cases have even dismissed workers simply because they belong to the trade union. Immediately upon the workers deciding to join the trade union, the enterprise installed a security door to stop the trade union leaders entering and to monitor the affiliated workers. Security guards also appeared, behaving in an aggressive and threatening manner.-- The Workers' Trade Union of the Chiriqu铆 Land Company (SITRACHIRI) has a collective agreement in force with the Chiriqu铆 Land Company which is owned by Chiquita Brand. This trade union has succeeded in maintaining a collective agreement with numerous benefits for its workers; moderate success has been achieved in providing workers with a certain degree of dignity. For this reason this enterprise is using countless ruses in its quest to put an end to the only collectively negotiated instrument that currently exists in the banana plantations and has attacked the trade union leaders, accusing them of various invented actions. For example, the workers in plantations 96 and 97 at the Chiriqu铆 Land Company (Chiquita Brand) presented a document in which they requested the division manager to intercede to encourage Mr. Ricardo Hern谩ndez, an official in the Human Resources Department, to adopt a position of respect for human rights, as he is an aggressive, insulting person who consistently violates the rights established in the collective agreement. The company took an aggressive stance in its reply to the trade union. A complaint was even made against the general secretary of SITRACHIRI alleging that some signatures were not actually attributable to the workers. The Coordinating Body of Banana Unions brought in its lawyer and is currently requesting that a handwriting test be carried out and also that preparations be made to submit a counter-claim because what the company is saying through Mr. Ricardo Hern谩ndez is false. The only definite fact is that this particular official is harassing unionized workers. Similarly, the enterprise has managed in a variety of ways to manipulate certain workers into submitting complaints and claims against the trade union and its leaders in order to harass and discredit the organization. To conclude, the executive committee is being severely persecuted.-- The Industrial Trade Union of Agricultural, Livestock and Similar Workers of Heredia (SITAGAH) operates in the Sarapiqu铆 sector (Heredia Province) in the plantations of the Compa帽铆a Bananera del Atl谩ntico (Chiquita Brand). At no time has the enterprise let up from fruitlessly harassing the workers not to join the trade union, and seeing their efforts frustrated as the workers continue to become members, they persecute them using a number of the methods described at the beginning of the complaint. There has been such extensive and heavy pressure that some workers have gone to the offices of the trade union in order to resign their membership, following the instructions of the enterprise management. Sworn statements to this effect have been made by the workers. All the violations described in this complaint have been submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security which has been entirely inefficient and has drawn out the proceedings for up to three years, leaving the trade union and its affiliates in a state of defencelessness. This has forced SITAGAH to appeal to the Constitutional Chamber to have its rights upheld, and more than 13 times the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been found guilty of delaying the proceedings and required to pay the damages caused. To illustrate this situation, the following rulings have been handed down by the Constitutional Chamber: 2724-96, 1947-97, 4298-97, 5854-97, 6483-97, 182-98, 337-98, 339-98, 340-98, 338-98, 619-98, 1351-98, 2662-98.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

On 17 August 1998, the Isla Grande plantation not only refused to reinstate workers as it had been ordered by law, but dismissed 90 more, in particular immigrants who for many years had travelled every day from Panama. The police and Costa Rican immigration officials also cooperated with the company refusing to allow these workers to cross the border for three days, using lists supplied by the company to pick out the workers who supported the trade union in order to treat them in this discriminatory manner. The company then alleged that these workers had abandoned their posts and refused to give them work. According to the IUF, the trade union held two meetings with representatives of the Ministry of Labour but no measures have been taken to remedy the violations of trade union rights.Second complaint by COSIBA","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

In addition, workers were shut in their offices to pressure them into signing the abovementioned blank sheets of paper. It was proposed to the workers that they sign a ""direct arrangement"" with the enterprise which is what happened on 14 July 1998, just four days after the workers had submitted the grievance to the courts. For this purpose they were taken to a private meeting at the home of the plantation manager in the company of Mr. Ricardo Hern谩ndez Coto, where a series of offers were made to the committee members such as the separate negotiation with them of high salaries and better working conditions. They were shown films and videotapes relating to the strikes that took place in 1984 in the south of Costa Rica and the trade union was blamed for the subsequent withdrawal by the Compa帽铆a Bananera de Costa Rica from that region; they were told that the strike had led to misery and abandoned plantations and if they did not want the same thing to happen at Sixaola they had to ""negotiate"" the ""direct arrangement"" being proposed to them. On that occasion attempts were even made to inebriate the workers' representatives in a restaurant.

The workers Manuel Pineda Becker, Ernesto Abrego Santos, Alejandro Palacios Becker and Hilario Jim茅nez Miranda were unable even to sign the list of claims as they were dismissed when the enterprise became aware of their intention to sign. More recently, the following workers were dismissed: Dionisio Tom谩s Robinson, Seferino Eugenio Jaen, Venancio Abrego Abrego, Valent铆n Abrego Santos, Pineda Salazar Marchena, Clemente Abrego Ochi, Genio Pineda Salazar, Leonel N. Garc铆a Estrib铆, Alejandro Gustavino Chamorro, Celestino Pinda Beker. All these workers have signed the list of claims and are members of the UTRAL trade union. On 17 August 1998, at the request of the representatives of Isla Grande S.A. and the other enterprises operating in the region, troops from the Civil Guard, Sixaola Commando, on the orders of Major Carlos Brenes, together with immigration officials and in the presence of representatives from the enterprise, blocked the workers at their respective workstations. In order to carry out the operation, which according to statements by Major Brenes was to target illegal Nicaraguan migrants, the Civil Guard troops had lists of workers affiliated to the trade union and of the signatories of the collective disputes and these workers were immediately returned to their place of origin. The enterprise' objective was to stop the workers reaching their posts in order subsequently to dismiss them for unjustified absence as in the case of Proyecto Agroindustrial Sixaola S.A. (PAIS S.A.), a subsidiary of the National Banana Corporation (CORBANA) in which the State of Costa Rica is the majority shareholder and which sells to Chiquita, which is currently seeking to dismiss workers affected by the ""Civil Guard and Immigration Operation"" carried out on 17, 18 and 19 August in which the foremen of this enterprise played a special role as ""police officers"" and ""judges"". Despite the complaint immediately lodged by the trade union, on the morning of 19 August over 100 workers were dismissed from the plantation, including managerial staff and foremen to give the impression that it was not a case of trade union persecution.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

More specifically it indicates the following:-- the security doors and security guards continue to be a problem in the Sarapiqu铆 sector where they are still obstructing the entry of its leaders and affiliated workers, specifically at ""Compa帽铆a Bananera Gacelas"" where affiliation is growing rapidly;-- at ""Isla Grande S.A."" the subsidiary of Chiquita is carrying out a sham sale to another subsidiary enterprise of Chiquita called ""Chiriqu铆 Land Company, Divisi贸n Sixaola"", with the aim of undermining the socio-economic collective dispute submitted by the workers. As is already known, the grievance was allowed and the administrative means of redress have now been exhausted which is why the application for a legal strike was submitted to the labour judge of the Province of Lim贸n. A large number of the workers have still not been reinstated in their posts, in spite of the judge's decision ordering the immediate reinstatement of all the workers dismissed in retaliation for having presented the collective dispute;-- the campaign being waged against the Workers' Trade Union of the Chiriqu铆 Land Company (SITRACHIRI) continues with a view to eliminating the existing collective agreement; this campaign is led by Mr. Ricardo Hern谩ndez Coto, the enterprise's industrial relations manager, who has apparently been contracted for this purpose. With the same vigour a similar campaign is being waged in favour of ""solidarity"" with a promoter from the Juan XXII Social School having been called in for this purpose. The executive committee of the solidarity association imposed by the Chiriqu铆 Land Company is made up of administrative representatives, in contravention of legislative provisions established to regulate solidarity associations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

These facts took place on 30 April 1999, a few days after their confirmation of membership had been transmitted to the company, in order to have their union dues checked off. The workers, like many of those who are employed by the Chiriqu铆 Land Company (Chiquita, Unit 490) have no protection against occupational risks, are not affiliated to Costa Rica Social Security, and their salaries are not linked to the pay benchmarks set by the National Pay Board, since they were lowered to 5,000 colons (US$17) for two full weeks of work, without a single day of rest. This salary is also lower than the one agreed upon in their employment contract. In addition, following the fabricated dismissal motives, Mr. Gait谩n Fern谩ndez (steward of the Trade Union of Workers of Agriculture, Cattle Raising and Associated Industries, and one of the most militant members of that union) was recently dismissed by the Gacelas agricultural enterprise.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

Whatever the case may be, and considering among other things the magnitude of the communication under examination, the lack of evidence to confirm the claims contained in the complaint, the vagueness of its content and above all the deadlines given for the Government's response, the competent national authorities proceeded to carry out an examination of the investigations into trade union persecution and/or unfair labour practices submitted by the trade unions involved in Case No. 1984. The protection of trade union rights is one of the Government's principal activities and one to which it dedicates considerable attention. The Constitution and the legal system guarantee trade union rights and Costa Rica has ratified Conventions Nos. 87, 98, 135 and 141. On the basis of this concern for trade union rights, in May 1998 the Executive Branch submitted for the consideration of the Legislative Plenary, in accordance with the law, a bill for constitutional reform prepared with the technical assistance of the ILO, which would remove the prohibition for foreigners to exercise management positions or positions of authority in trade unions as prescribed in the section under examination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

On the collective level, the establishment without the need for previous authorization of trade union organizations that cannot be dissolved and, on the individual level, the possibility of freely joining such organizations. Article 7 of the Constitution confers ""higher authority to laws"" to the international Conventions approved by the Legislative Assembly.

Among the serious attempts to modernize labour legislation and with the aim of developing constitutional standards pertaining to freedom of association and international Conventions, above all Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, the Legislative Assembly passed Act No. 7360 of 12 November 1993 which amends the Act concerning solidarity associations, the Labour Code and the Organization of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security Act. Among the most important reforms incorporated into the Labour Code by this Act it is important to underline the addition of Chapter III concerning ""protection of trade union rights"", which guarantees effective protection against all forms of anti-union discrimination. In effect, this chapter bans any ""acts or omissions that tend to avoid, restrict, constrain or prevent the free exercise of the collective rights of workers, their trade unions or associations of workers"" establishing also that ""any act originating from them is absolutely null and void and will be penalized according to the form and conditions indicated in the Labour Code, its supplementary or related Acts, for the infringement of prohibitive provisions"". As confirmation of the above, the legislation under reference provides that the members of trade unions in the process of being set up (for a period of no more than four months) enjoy labour stability, as do a certain number of trade union leaders (while exercising their duties and for six months afterwards) and candidates to the executive committee (for three months from the time their applications are made). In addition, Act No. 7360 establishes, in the event of the dismissal without just cause of workers protected by this stability, that ""the competent labour judge will declare this dismissal null and void and will consequently order the worker's reinstatement and the payment of the arrears of wages, as well as the penalties to be imposed on the employer in keeping with this Code and its supplementary or related Acts"". It establishes that ""acts or omissions committed by employers, workers or their respective organizations which transgress the standards provided in the Conventions adopted by the International Labour Organization and ratified by the Legislative Assembly, and the standards provided in this Code and in social security legislation, constitute punishable offences"". In the case of violations of these rights, the worker or his or her organization can have recourse to the relevant administrative body, in this case the National Labour Inspection Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security or directly to judicial means of redress. This Act grants considerable powers to the National Labour Inspection Directorate for the investigation of violations that have been brought to its attention, in keeping with the provisions made by the Constitutional Chamber on this subject in rulings Nos. 5000-93 and 4298-97. The Act empowers the National Labour Inspection Directorate to use ""the means it considers to be appropriate"" for this purpose which means that the investigating inspector can visit the work centre and obtain all available information; to this end the inspector can review payrolls, books, take statements, etc.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

The following are some of these rulings:-- Ruling No. 5000-93 handed down at 10:09 on 8 October 1993: this establishes that the dismissal of a workers' representative violates the fundamental right of association as the workers are deprived of their leaders and therefore of the appropriate and legitimate defence of their personal and trade union rights. The Constitutional Chamber determined that ""a dismissal of workers' representatives, whether unionized or not, is legally inadmissible (even if the employers pay social benefits) as it violates the special protection granted to representation under the Political Constitution, international Conventions and other laws, to the personal detriment of the representatives and the workers they represent and whose fundamental right of association is also violated as a result of this dismissal, as they are deprived of their leaders and therefore of the appropriate and legitimate defence of their personal and trade union interests ..."". Similarly, the Chamber provided that ""the dismissal of regular workers must be resolved with equal regulatory support when the express or tacit reason is their membership of an association or trade union because this too violates their fundamental rights. It should be noted that a link to such an organization as a regular member brings into play higher values of good fellowship and social and labour harmony vis-脿-vis which economic compensation, represented by the payment of social benefits, lacks legal validity because the will of the employer is constitutionally and legally restrained or restricted from the general perspective of workers' human rights and from the specific perspective of labour law which protects general public interests ..."". This protection was subsequently confirmed in Costa Rican law with the issuing of Act No. 7360 of 4 November 1993.-- Ruling No. 1696-92 handed down at 15:30 on 23 August 1992 and its corresponding addition and clarification handed down at 15:00 on 30 October 1992 (relating to public sector workers).-- Ruling No. 4298-97 handed down at 16:45 on 23 July 1997 and the corresponding administrative guidelines: as regards the procedure for complaints of alleged trade union persecution and unfair labour practices, it is indicated that: ""... For this purpose a procedure was established which begins with administrative means of redress before the National Labour Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security whose work is restricted to carrying out an investigation to determine whether or not there are grounds to submit a complaint through the competent legal channels"". The procedure foreseen in sections 363 et seq. of the Labour Code is a special one as its main function is to ensure harmony in relations between workers and employers and as a result legal provisions of an industrial nature are evaluated without the fundamental objective being to find a final solution to the conflict between the parties but, as previously indicated, simply to determine whether or not there are grounds for submitting the complaint to the competent legal authority. To summarize the procedure established in the Labour Code: (1) it can be initiated at the request of one of the parties or by operation of law; (2) if it is clear from this and the documents submitted that the merits of the case should be heard, the parties involved will be summoned to a hearing in which all the evidence considered necessary will be submitted; (3) on the assumption that the documents and the evidence provided by the complainant are insufficient to determine whether or not it is necessary to examine the merits of the case, the National Labour Inspection Directorate shall order the appointed inspector to carry out a preliminary investigation in which he or she can look into the alleged violations using the means he or she considers appropriate; (4) if after this preliminary investigation the inspector considers that there should be an examination of the merits of the case, he or she will grant the parties a hearing, pursuant to section 365 of the Labour Code, to allow them to give statements on the facts investigated; (5) once this hearing has taken place a record will be drawn up and the report will be transmitted to the National Director of Labour; (6) the National Director of Labour then decides whether to submit the request to the competent judicial authority or to order the shelving of the file on the basis of a substantiated decision against which a discretionary remedy and an appeal before the Minister of Labour are possible. Concerning the procedure, the Chamber referred to adds: ""... it is reasonable to expect that the National Labour Inspection Directorate shall respect a deadline ... (of two months) to conclude its administrative intervention (from the due submission of the complaint before this body until the decision to submit a complaint through judicial channels or to shelve the case) ..."". The Government has respected the above terms pronounced by the Constitutional Chamber. In this respect the Minister of Labour and Social Security issued Directive DMT-063-98 dated 15 May 1998 in which the competent administrative authorities are reminded of their duty to process rapidly -- within two months --, without prejudicing the rights that derive from the principles of due process and legitimate defence, the processes applicable in cases of anti-union discrimination. At present the National Labour Inspection Directorate has set about processing the case within the given deadlines. In this respect the Government provides some examples of the efforts being made by the National Labour Inspection Directorate in order to comply in a reasonable manner with the deadline indicated by the Constitutional Chamber.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

The purpose of this is to guarantee that procedures relating to allegations of anti-union discrimination are completed within two months.

In this document the judicial authorities are informed of the Committee's concern about slowness and long delays in deciding proceedings. The Government wishes to make plain its full readiness to remedy the concerns of the Committee on Freedom of Association regarding alleged delays in achieving justice through administrative processes to evaluate unfair labour practices, by defining reasonable policies to protect the rights of unionized workers and ensuring swift procedures without prejudice to the constitutional guarantees of due process and legitimate defence. It is the parties to the dispute who are primarily responsible for delaying the procedures in question by using the delaying actions and tactics available to them through due process, a situation the Government has informed the Committee on Freedom of Association about at great length. In this respect, the Government regrets that the complainant trade union is making inexact claims to the ILO which have now been superseded in national legislation and practice. As a result the complainants seem somewhat hasty in their claim that the ""Government of Costa Rica does not ensure that its own legislation and legal decisions with respect to the exercise of trade union rights in banana plantations are properly respected or effectively applied"".","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

For this reason, having evaluated the doctrine and legislation that uphold the prohibition of the right to strike in the agriculture and forestry sector contained in clause (b) of section 376 of the Labour Code, in August 1997 the Executive Branch presented a draft bill to the Legislative Assembly to repeal that clause. Similarly, in February 1998 the Constitutional Chamber issued its momentous ruling No. 1317-98 handed down at 10:12 on 27 February 1998, record No. 4222-A-92.

Only one of these complaints is against the enterprise Bananera Isla Grande S.A., and was received by the Directorate on 15 July 1998. This complaint of unfair labour practices has been legally processed and has now been submitted by the National Labour Inspection Directorate to the labour courts. During the administrative investigation the enterprise was found to be violating labour and social security legislation as well as committing unfair labour practices and trade union persecution when it was determined that the workers were being harassed to resign their membership of the trade union. With respect to the complaint submitted by the trade union following the end of the abovementioned investigation, concerning the alleged sale of the assets of the Isla Grande S.A. enterprise to the Chiriqu铆 Land Company, so that it would be considered as part of the judicial process submitted, the Government wishes to state that the administrative authorities do not know whether this sale is fraudulent or not, given that the party concerned must take the appropriate legal action before the corresponding courts.With respect to the inspection carried out on 23 and 24 July 1998 by officials from the National Labour Inspection Directorate at Isla Grande S.A., it was established that the enterprise was infringing labour legislation in the following ways: practising periodic dismissal (section 30, clauses (b) and (c) of the Labour Code); hiring a higher percentage of (illegal) foreigners than permitted by law (section 3 of the Labour Code); it was not registered with the Costa Rican Workers' Social Security Fund; workers were treated disrespectfully; pay was below the legal minimum, etc. All these inspection duties were carried out by investigating inspectors under the protection of the powers granted by the Organization of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security Act.Of the remaining five cases relating to the complaint lodged by the UTRAL trade union relating to the Virginia, Manzanillo, Gandoca and Daytona plantations, owned by the enterprise Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola (PAIS), and lastly the case relating to Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola (PAIS), the competent ministerial department, through its body of inspectors, carried out the relevant investigations between 24 July and 20 November 1998. As a result of these investigations the corresponding complaints were submitted to the courts as described above. The investigations determined the existence of unfair labour practices in the form of harassment and threats so that workers would resign their membership in the trade union as well as the wrongful withholding of union dues deducted from workers. The Government wishes to underline the fact that at no time did the trade union in question denounce through administrative channels the presence of security doors or aggressive guards to prevent the entry of trade union officials.-- Workers' Trade Union of the Sixaola Agroindustrial Project (SITRAPAIS): on 1 July 1997, this trade union lodged a complaint with the National Labour Inspection Directorate against the enterprise called Proyecto Agroindustrial de Sixaola (PAIS) for unfair labour practices and trade union persecution. This ministerial office processed the complaint according to the law, investigating the case and concluding in effect that within the enterprise workers were being dismissed for their membership of the trade union and affiliated workers were being intimidated and threatened as were those who intended to join the trade union. For these reasons, on 2 June 1998, the National Labour Inspection Directorate lodged a formal complaint with the competent labour courts. Although the initial complaint referred to chains on doors, padlocks and permanent security guards, at no time was it shown that these security measures were an obstacle to trade union officials entering the enterprise. (The facts relating to the complaint referred to in this paragraph are not mentioned in the IUF's complaint.)-- Workers' Trade Union of the Chiriqu铆 Land Company (SITRACHIRI): on 4 August 1997, this trade union lodged a complaint with the abovementioned Directorate against the Chiriqu铆 Land Company. The same organization lodged an application for the withdrawal of the complaint, informing the ministerial office that the loss of interest in pursuing the investigation was due to the fact that a satisfactory agreement had been reached with the enterprise. Given these facts, the National Labour Inspection Directorate closed the case under examination. On 18 September 1997, SITRACHIRI submitted a further complaint to the ministerial authorities against the Chiriqu铆 Land Company, Sixaola division, plantations 96 and 97, citing unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution. From the investigation carried out it was found that workers were being harassed to resign their membership of the trade union and preferential treatment was given to members of the Solidarity association, whose executive committee includes employers' representatives. In view of this result and the violations encountered, on 2 February 1998 the National Labour Inspection Directorate lodged a complaint with the courts against the Chiriqu铆 Land Company. In this connection the Government wishes to stress that during the complaint and investigation process, SITRACHIRI made no reference to the infringement of the prevailing collective agreement, as stated in the complaint brought before this international body.-- It is necessary to make it clear to the ILO that a review of the records in the archives of the National Labour Inspection Directorate reveal that there are no pending complaints relating to the Compa帽铆a Bananera del Atl谩ntico.-- Trade Union of Agricultural, Livestock and Similar Workers of Heredia (SITAGAH): there are records of seven complaints having been submitted between 1995 and 1998 through administrative channels, of which four concern Bananera Guapinol S.A. These complaints have been shelved, given that the results of the investigations carried out did not reveal any evidence of legal issues. As regards the complaint instituted in April 1996 by this trade union against Bananera El Roble Sociedad, this has been archived at the National Labour Inspection Directorate as the existence of anti-union persecution and unfair labour practices was not demonstrated. Furthermore, on 5 October 1998 the same complainant lodged a complaint with the National Labour Inspection Directorate for unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution against Amado D铆az Guevara, a member of the trade union's executive committee, against the enterprise Bananera Oropel S.A. This investigation was completed on 28 November 1998 when the investigating official submitted his final report and referred the case to the Directorate for a final decision, which is currently under consideration. On 29 October 1998, SITAGAH lodged a complaint against Bananera Las Gacelas S.A. for unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution, citing the fact that when they arrived at the enterprise the security guards would not let them pass. In view of the complaint, the National Labour Inspection Directorate called for an investigating inspector to carry out an investigation. He submitted his final report on 26 November 1998, referring the file back to the National Labour Inspection Directorate for its final decision. The Government stresses that this case is the only one under examination in which a complaint has expressly been sent to the national authorities by the trade unions denouncing the obstruction by employers' representatives of entry into the enterprise.-- Complaint lodged by Mr. Florentino Valencia Valencia, for unfair labour practices and anti-union persecution against the Finca Talamanca, on 11 December 1995. The Government states that the action was shelved in November 1996 at the request of the plaintiff.-- Workers' Trade Union, Plantaciones Agr铆colas (SITRAP): on 10 March and 8 June 1998, this trade union lodged a complaint against the Corporaci贸n de Desarrollo Agr铆cola del Monte S.A. The complainant claims that the enterprise is engaging in anti-union conduct with the objective of removing Mr. Didier Leiton Valverde, a member of the workers' permanent committee and a trade union member. Once the corresponding investigation had been carried out, which was completed on 30 September 1998, it was found that the enterprise had in fact engaged in unfair labour practices to the detriment of Mr. Didier Leiton Valverde. For these reasons the National Labour Inspection Directorate proceeded to lodge a legal complaint on 5 October 1998. However, in view of a verbal request by the Labour Relations Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the process was interrupted since SITRAP and the representatives of the enterprise requested administrative conciliation in order to resolve the conflict that had arisen between the parties. As a result of this conciliation, in a document dated 13 October 1998, prepared by the above-noted department and sent to the National Labour Inspection Directorate by mutual agreement, the parties withdrew the complaint and therefore the file is pending examination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

In that paragraph the Committee expressly recognizes the delay caused by the parties during these proceedings, concluding that the ""administrative and legal actions brought by (the enterprise) meant that the Government was unable to go to the judicial authority before the end of August 1996 in order to obtain the penalties and compensation provided for in the legislation"". It is incorrect to claim, as the complainant has done, that the National Labour Inspection Directorate intentionally delays the processing of complaints of union persecution and unfair labour practices, given that it has been shown that the conduct of the National Labour Inspection Directorate was entirely in keeping with the procedures recognized and approved both by the country's highest jurisdictional body and by the ministerial authorities.

Furthermore, under cover of official letter DRT-438-98 dated 30 July 1998 a copy of the above record was sent to the National Labour Inspection Directorate.-- In official letter DRT-439-98 dated 31 July 1998 the Labour Relations Department once again convened the parties concerned for a meeting on 19 August 1998; the leadership of the Civil Guard of Sixaola was involved in notifying the employers' representatives.-- As regards the alleged dismissal of workers affiliated to UTRAL despite a collective dispute having been submitted to the courts in a decision dated 5 August 1998 the first civil and labour court of Lim贸n, in proceedings relating to the socio-economic collective dispute presented by Mauricio Abrego and others against Bananera Isla Grande S.A., ordered the defendant to reinstate the workers dismissed from their usual duties.-- In a note dated 11 August 1998, relating to the official convocation for 19 August 1998, signed by Mr. Adri谩n Alvarado Morales, the administrator of the Isla Grande plantation, and addressed to the Labour Relations Department, the author states that he is not the legal representative of that company.-- On 19 August 1998, the date when the abovementioned conciliation meeting was due to take place, only the UTRAL representative attended, who consequently requested that the representatives of Isla Grande S.A. be summoned a third time, and sent a copy of this convocation to the National Labour Inspection Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security for their information and eventual action.-- Once again, in official letter DRT-506-98 dated 24 August 1998 the parties were convened for a conciliation meeting on 24 September 1998 at 10.00.-- On 12 September 1998, in a communication signed by the general manager of the Chiriqu铆 Land Company, of which this Department received a copy, the executive committee of the Workers' Trade Union of Chiriqu铆 Land Company and the workers of Isla Grande S.A. were informed that the enterprise Chiriqu铆 Land Company had bought the assets of Isla Grande S.A. plantation, which were now covered by the collective agreement governing the Chiriqu铆 Land Company.-- As regards 24 September 1998, the date on which the conciliation meeting was to be held between the parties mentioned, it is noted that neither party attended the meeting.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

On the subject of the Trade Union of Agricultural, Livestock and Similar Workers of Heredia (SITAGAH), on 22 July 1998, Mr. Ram贸n Barrantes Cascante, in his capacity as general secretary of SITAGAH, addressed a request to the Ministry of Labour to summon the employers' representatives of the Compa帽铆a Bananera Gacela S.A. to a meeting to evaluate ""... the reasons why the security guard at that company acted in an unusual manner when, on 9 July, Mr. F茅lix Andino in the performance of his duties approached the security door situated at the entrance to the plantation and the security guard did not raise the door although he knew that the worker was working for the enterprise and the tractor he was driving belonged to the enterprise ..."". By reason of the above-noted action, the Labour Relations Department in official letters DRT-418-98 dated 23 July 1998 and DRT-457-98 dated 5 August 1998 convened the parties in question to a meeting to proceed with the respective conciliation procedures. Notes sent to that Department by the employer on 1 and 13 August 1998 indicate that ""The security guards have the obligation to keep the access route for vehicles to the plantation closed in order to guarantee as far as circumstances permit the security of the people who work for it and of their property. Vehicles of all kinds, whether privately owned or the property of the plantation, must stop at the main gate before they can enter. It is not true that the guard identifies vehicles in the distance and immediately proceeds to open the gate. This procedure is contrary to all security standards. Mr. Andino, the driver of the tractor, is obliged to stop the tractor at the main gate to the plantation and wait for the guard on duty to clear the way for him to enter."" Although the employers' representative did not appear in person at the hearings, the Department drew up two records of the meetings dated 4 and 19 August 1998.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

On 5 August 1998, the judicial authority ordered that the dismissed workers be reinstated in their duties; on 17 August 1998 the enterprise refused to reinstate these workers and dismissed 90 more who had signed the list of claims (according to the complainant, these dismissals occurred as follows: on the request of Bananera Isla Grande S.A. and other enterprises operating in the region, from 17 to 19 August, in the presence of enterprise representatives, the Civil Guard and immigration officials, citing an alleged operation targeting illegal immigrants and using lists of workers affiliated to the trade union and signatories of the list of claims, stopped workers crossing the border in order later to dismiss them alleging ""unjustified absence""); a large number of the dismissed workers were not reinstated in their duties.

In August 1998, following conciliation procedures by the administrative authorities, the enterprise indicated in writing that the access route for vehicles to the plantation is kept closed in order to guarantee the security of the persons working there and of their property and that the person referred to in the complaint who wanted to enter had to stop the tractor at the access gate to the plantation and wait for the guard to clear the way for him to enter. The Committee notes the Government's general statement referring to the free passage of trade union leaders in plantations, that the right to hold meetings and the right of passage are constitutional rights and that the Directive issued by the Ministry of Labour on 18 January 1999 orders the competent authorities to remain constantly vigilant so that the right of workers and their trade union leaders to hold meetings and engage in peaceful industrial action is not suppressed. Given that the allegations included no names or dates relating to obstacles to the passage of trade union leaders and observing that according to the annexes to the Government's reply the trade union's complaint refers to one single worker from the enterprise driving a tractor, and makes no reference at all to whether it was a trade union leader, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.Allegations relating to the Chiriqu铆 Land Company","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

When the trade union complained about this behaviour, the enterprise denounced the general secretary of SITRACHIRI and persuaded a number of workers to take legal proceedings against the trade union and its leaders, resulting in the executive committee of the trade union being severely persecuted.

The Committee notes with interest that: (1) as a result of ruling No. 4298-97 handed down by the Constitutional Chamber on 23 July 1997, the administrative authorities are required to carry out the applicable procedures for alleged trade union persecution and unfair labour practices within two months; (2) in Directives dated 15 May 1998 and 18 January 1999 this duty was reiterated by the Ministry of Labour to the competent administrative authorities, and the National Labour Inspection Directorate is endeavouring to process cases within the set deadline; (3) in an official letter dated 18 January 1999 the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and the judicial authorities were informed of the Committee's concern about excessive slowness in the handing down of decisions; (4) by way of Constitutional Chamber ruling No. 1317-98 handed down on 27 February 1998 the prohibition to strike in the agricultural (including the banana plantations) and forestry sector (section 376(b) of the Labour Code) was declared to be unconstitutional; (5) the competent administrative authorities are intervening at the request of the trade unions to achieve extrajudicial conciliation. The Committee also notes the Government's indication that the administrative and judicial processes end when all stages -- administrative and judicial -- have been completed, that not to respect due process would be the same as rejecting the provisions of the Constitution and that it is the parties to the dispute who are primarily responsible for delaying proceedings by using delaying tactics and actions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

It observes that in keeping with the information sent by the Government, the report shows that ruling No. 4298-97 handed down by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice dated 23 July 1997 establishes that the administrative procedure for investigating complaints of alleged trade union persecution and unfair labour practices (or other investigations or procedures established in the Labour Code) is a special one and differs from the general public administration procedure; this ruling indicates the guidelines to be adhered to in future in this special procedure and establishes a deadline of two months for the National Labour Inspection Directorate to conclude its administrative intervention. According to the report, before the ruling was handed down, the parties involved in industrial administrative procedures used all possible legal remedies available to them to try to strengthen and guarantee their position, delaying and obstructing the procedures with their various appeals, assessments and petitions which in practice led to the administration being slow and inefficient in resolving the dispute submitted by the trade unions. The report adds that the National Labour Inspection Directorate has taken steps to promote the ongoing development of efficient and prompt protection and has been adapting itself to the guidelines of the Constitutional Chamber, having also handed down a number of Directives such as No. N-1331-98 of 27 July 1998, to be applied in conjunction with the administrative procedure to adhere to in cases such as trade union persecution and unfair labour practices.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

Ten of the 13 decisions handed down by the Constitutional Chamber and mentioned by the complainant are attached to the report. The Committee observes that an examination of the ten decisions attached reveals the following: (1) four of the decisions (Nos. 0619-98, 1351-98, 1947-97 and 5854-97) do not refer to trade union matters; (2) one decision (No. 6483-97) shows that eight months passed before the Ministry of Labour convened a conciliation hearing for three enterprises (requested by the trade union) in October 1997 to present the new trade union executive committee; (3) one decision (No. 0338-98) shows that a complaint of trade union persecution and unfair practices was resolved by the administrative authority on 28 November 1997, 28 months after its submission; (4) four decisions (Nos. 0337-98, 0339-98, 0340-98 and 4298-97) show that between 13 and 24 months passed between the submission of the complaint and the date on which the respective decision was handed down by the Constitutional Chamber, with these dates being situated for the various cases between 23 July 1997 (when the Constitutional Chamber established the duration of the administrative procedure at two months) and 21 January 1998; in these decisions the Constitutional Chamber indicates that the administrative authority did not respect the deadline of two months for the completion of the administrative procedure and rejects the arguments put forward by the Ministry of Labour citing the limited number of officials, limited travel allowances and means of transport, the high number of appeals and interlocutory applications lodged by the parties, the high number of cases submitted or the need to adhere to chronological order when processing complaints.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904868, response status: 200"

It requests the Government to ensure that those dismissed because of their trade union office or membership are reinstated (all the members of the executive board of the workers' association and 265 members have been dismissed) and that the collective agreement is implemented. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee expresses its concern at the slowness, noting that the long delay in deciding proceedings amounts to a denial of justice, and inefficiency of the proceedings on allegations of anti-trade union discrimination in a considerable number of cases and requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure the speedy conduct of proceedings.(c) The Committee deeply deplores that the enterprise FERTICA SA has once again engaged in anti-union practices and urges the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that it recognizes the legitimate executive board of the Association of Workers of FERTICA SA (ATFe) and hand over all its members' union dues. Furthermore, recalling that the intervention of an employer to promote the constitution of the executive board of a trade union and interference with its correspondence are acts that constitute a grave violation of the principle of freedom of association, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in the future and to guarantee the rights of the legitimate executive board.(d) Noting that the administrative authorities confirmed in 1998 the extension of the collective agreement in force, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the enterprise FERTICA SA honours that collective agreement.(e) With regard to the allegations concerning: prohibition of entry by ATFe union officials into the premises of the company, and the prohibition from holding demonstrations, meetings and assemblies in the usual places; the dismissals alleged to have occurred in FERTICA SA on grounds of social and economic dispute despite the existence of a judicial order that such dismissals should not take place; promoting of the constitution of the SITRAFER trade union organization in FERTICA SA; the disappearance of the pension that had been established by the collective agreement and which was the property of the workers, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to conduct detailed investigations without delay into all the allegations and to ensure that the judicial orders stating that dismissals in FERTICA SA should not take place are respected and to keep it informed of the result of those investigations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904717, response status: 200"

It has repeatedly urged the parties to comply with those recommendations, without at any time claiming the authority to impose measures which are the responsibility of the courts of law (the reinstatement of the workers in question who were dismissed because of their trade union office is a matter which is the exclusive competence of the courts). In particular, the Minister of Labour and Social Security, in communication DMTA.MB-210 dated 7 September 1998, invited the general manager of FERTICA and the secretary-general of ATFe to an administrative conciliation meeting, which was held on 21 September 1998, with a view to reaching an agreement on the recommendations concerning the reinstatement of the workers dismissed as well as compliance with the collective agreement. The arguments put forward by the employer against such a course of action included the statement that the dismissals of the trade union officials were made under the provisions of the collective agreement and before the latter was denounced by the ATFe. The Government also refers to a meeting that took place on 18 March 1998 between the parties and the head of labour matters of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. During the meeting, the enterprise rejected the conciliation initiative undertaken by the ministry to examine issues similar to those examined by the Committee in Case No. 1879 and which are the subject of various judicial proceedings. Moreover, the Ministry of Labour issued an administrative guideline to the competent ministerial bodies requiring them once again to take all the necessary steps to urge the parties in dispute to reach a solution and to try to secure the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers in their workplaces and compliance with the collective agreement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904717, response status: 200"

Furthermore, on 15 May 1998 the present Minister of Labour and Social Security issued circular DMT-063-98 which reminded the competent ministerial authorities of their obligation to apply in a speedy manner, within a period of two months and without prejudice to the rights resulting from the principles of due process and legitimate defence, the applicable procedure in cases of anti-union discrimination. This time limit was established by the Constitutional Court, in decision No. 4298-97 of 23 July 1997. According to this jurisprudence, in cases of suspected trade union persecution and unfair labour practices, the task of the Ministry is to determine whether or not there are grounds for a denunciation to be made to the competent courts by the Director-General of Labour (the latter's decision may be appealed to the Ministry of Labour), with a period of two months being established for the completion of the administrative inquiry. According to the Government, it is the parties in dispute who have been mainly responsible for delaying the proceedings through the use of delaying tactics and procedures facilitated by due process. Moreover, the Government emphasized its unequivocal readiness to address the Committee's concern about the supposed slowness of justice in administrative proceedings on unfair labour practices.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904717, response status: 200"

However, the employer claimed that since the supposed representation of the ATFe trade union in the person of Marco Antonio Guzm谩n Rodr铆guez is being challenged in the ordinary labour court by Messrs. Tom谩s Alberto Cort茅s G贸mez and Oscar Fern谩ndez Salazar, FERTICA SA has transferred the said trade union dues to the Trade Union of Workers of FERTICA, the legal personality of which is recorded in the register of the Ministry of Labour. Moreover, the employer states that the different legal cases related to the matters in hand are still under way. As a result, the Minister of Labour has instructed the competent labour authorities to study and ensure the application of all labour legislation, with a view to establishing a harmonious relationship between the employer and employees, as a guarantee of order and social justice. In this context, direct instructions have been given to these authorities to intervene in the settlement of the dispute with a view to achieving an extrajudicial conciliation between the parties.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904717, response status: 200"

It also notes that instructions have also been given to ensure non-interference by employers in the executive boards of trade unions and trade union correspondence and that the Government has instructed the labour inspectors to step up their monitoring of the FERTICA SA enterprise to ensure that there is no impediment to the constitutional right of assembly of workers and trade union officials and that they are permitted to hold peaceful assemblies.

The ICFTU states that this has occurred in several companies, such as, for example, Fertilizantes de CentroamUrica SA (FERTICA), where the collective agreement in force was broken and the entire trade union leadership in the company was dismissed. The ICFTU adds that, with regard to the acts committed by FERTICA, it entered a complaint against the Government of Costa Rica in 1996 (Case No. 1879), which was examined by the Committee at its meeting in November 1996 (see 305th Report, Case No. 1879 (Costa Rica), paras. 183 to 205). The complainant organization states that on that occasion the Committee requested the Government to take measures with a view to mediating between the parties to reach a quick settlement of the dispute between the FERTICA SA Workers' Association and the company through negotiation, taking fully into account the provisions of Conventions Nos.98 and 135, ratified by Costa Rica, and in particular to reinstate all those dismissed because of their membership of official position in the trade union, and to fulfil the collective agreement.

The ICFTU alleges the following specific anti-union acts:-- trade union leaders are barred from entry into the company's premises and they are prohibited from holding trade union demonstrations, meetings and assemblies in the customary places, and from publishing circulars, flyers and notices. In addition, trade union noticeboards and notices were removed, and faced with this situation, the trade union sent telegrams to the workers to call them to an extraordinary meeting to reform the constitution, but the company opened the telegrams and prevented them from reaching the people to whom they were addressed, and had them sent back. Also in the context of this obstructive attitude and rejection of any communication by the trade union, the company refused to accept a communication on the composition of the executive board of the Association of Fertilizer Workers (ATFe);-- the administrative authorities are not resolving the appeal concerning the application of the collective agreement;-- the ATFe resorted to the judicial authorities in Puntarenas on the grounds of a social and economic dispute in the company, and although a judicial order was made not to proceed with dismissals, the company dismissed the striking workers;-- the company refuses to hand over to the ATFe the trade union dues of its members withheld since May 1996;-- the company has promoted the formation of an executive board in parallel to the ATFe, to which it handed over the trade union dues. Furthermore, the complainant organization states that the company promoted the formation of a trade union organization within the company under the name Sindicato de Trabajadores de FERTICA (SITRAFER), whose leadership is composed of members of the executive board parallel to the ATFe;-- the company has drawn up blacklists containing the names of trade union members;-- it caused the disappearance of the pension fund that had been created through the collective agreement, and which belonged to the workers, by eliminating workers' representation in the administration of the fund and misuse of the capital.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904716, response status: 200"

The Government adds that it should be emphasized that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, since commencing its functions on 8 May 1998, has dealt with all matters of which it was informed of a social and labour character, and that the administrative authorities have remained open for dialogue and collaboration with all sectors of society in seeking social harmony. According to the Government, both Case No. 1879 and the supposed ""new matters"" have been dealt with in the framework of the rule of law, faithfully observing the current legal order and employment practice, which is the reason why it cannot reasonably be asserted that workers' rights are being violated or not respected.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904716, response status: 200"

The Government adds that, under Costa Rican law, the courts are responsible for ordering the reinstatement of the workers concerned. In the present case, the Government is playing the role of mediator, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations and urging the parties to comply, as shown by the conciliatory measures taken in the above-mentioned office, but it is not permitted to impose measures that are a matter for the courts.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904716, response status: 200"

It is clear that this request does not contain the slightest wish to refuse, let alone fail to attend, the above meeting. Quite the contrary, they are desirous of clarifying some issues central to the matter and request a new date to be fixed for the hearing. The new hearing was also held in the Minister's office, and the employers' side, represented by the managing director and the trade union, after expressing their appreciation of the Minister's efforts to mediate in the matter, set about finding a solution.

Having conducted conciliation proceedings between the parties, and faced with FERTICA's lack of interest in a new agreement, the Department of Labour Relations settled the initial application by a resolution of 7 May 1997, refusing the union's application. However, the same department subsequently revoked the refusal on appeal, in its resolution of 21 May 1997, holding the collective labour agreement to be extended. Faced with this latter resolution, FERTICA SA sought the remedies of revocation, appeal and nullity, which were refused on 23 March 1998, by a resolution of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which confirmed the extension of the collective labour agreement. Thus the Government asserts that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security confirmed that the collective agreement signed on 15 September 1994 between FERTICA and ATFe remained in force;-- with regard to the dismissals resulting from a social and economic dispute, despite the existence of a judicial order prohibiting such dismissals, the Government states that -- without verifying the truth of the facts, given that the complainant organization chose to air the matter before this international body, without first notifying the national instances competent to give due process to all the charges -- the matter refers to a supposed failure by the employer to obey a judicial order. The Government considers that to defend itself from these supposed illegal acts, the complainant organization should resort to the legal remedies available in the judicial system, within the time- limits and in the form required under the applicable law;-- with regard to the allegations concerning the barring of ATFe union leaders from entry to the company's premises, the ban on holding demonstrations, meetings or assemblies in the normal places, the removal of the union's noticeboards, circulars and flyers, the opening of telegrams addressed to ATFe members and the withholding of ATFe union dues, the Government states that the complainant organization has a full assessment of the facts of the matter in the above-mentioned report by the Labour Inspectorate;-- with regard to the creation of an executive board parallel to that of the ATFe, the Government states that it is carrying out investigations into certain aspects analysed in the above-mentioned Labour Inspectorate report;-- with regard to the SITRAFER union, which the complainant organization calls a ""shadow union"", the Government makes no comment, bearing in mind that it involves a social organization duly registered with the appropriate authorities, and that at the present time it has not been the subject of an administrative investigation to determine the truth of the facts alleged here;-- with respect to the alleged creation of blacklists, the Government says that it is not aware of this, and that it is ""a non-proven fact"", according to the Labour Inspectorate report;-- with regard to the alleged disappearance of the workers' pension fund, the Government states that these are charges against the company, FERTICA SA, on which the Government declines to comment, since this would require a prior proceeding to seek the truth of the alleged facts, so as to guarantee the parties concerned due process and legitimate defence.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904716, response status: 200"

In any case, the Government holds that it has demonstrated its constant search for solutions to achieve social peace through dialogue and unity, wholly refuting the complaint entered by the complainants with regard to the supposed failure to comply with the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in Case No. 1879, and the supposed existence of new facts, which may possibly exist, but of which the Government in its undefended position, is not aware, because of the dual track, national and international, used by the complainants to air their concerns.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904716, response status: 200"

The Committee further notes that the complainant organization alleges new acts in violation of trade union rights at FERTICA SA, whereby the company's management: (1) prevents the entry of ATFe union leaders to the company's premises and prohibits them from holding trade union demonstrations, meetings and assemblies; (2) removed the trade union noticeboards and notices and prevented the publication of circulars, flyers and meeting notices; (3) prevented the delivery of telegrams addressed to ATFe members; (4) refuses to receive communications on the formation of the ATFe executive board; (5) dismissed striking workers despite the fact that the judicial authorities ordered the dismissals not to be carried out; (6) refuses to hand over to the ATFe its members' union dues; (7) promoted the constitution of an executive board parallel to that of the ATFe and a trade union organization called the Sindicato de Trabajadores de FERTICA (SITRAFER); (8) drew up blacklists containing the names of trade union members; and (9) caused the disappearance of the workers' pension fund that had been set up under the collective agreement.

In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take new measures to implement without delay the conclusions and recommendations it made at its meeting of November 1996 and to keep it informed in this regard. In addition, the Committee must once again point out that it is presented with a case of dilatoriness in the administration of justice given that the matters complained of by the complainant date from 1995. Consequently, the Committee recalls, as it did in its first examination of these allegations (see 305th Report, Case No. 1879, para. 202), that proceedings relating to matters of anti-union discrimination, in violation of Convention No. 98, should be examined promptly, so that the necessary corrective measures can be really effective; excessive delay in dealing with anti-union discrimination cases and, in particular, the long delay in deciding proceedings for the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders amounts to a denial of justice and thus a denial of the union rights of those affected. On that occasion, the Committee also expressed its concern at the tardiness and inefficiency of the proceedings in a large number of cases and requested the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure the speedy conduct of proceedings.Allegations concerning new violations of trade union rights in the company FERTICA SA","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904716, response status: 200"

The Committee is aware that the term ""registration"" may have different connotations in different countries; however, it stresses that the approval of a collective agreement by the authorities should be limited to a control of the respect of the minimum legal standards required by the legislation; (ii) having conducted conciliation proceedings between the parties and faced with the company's lack of interest, the Department of Labour Relations refused the union's application on 7 May 1997; (iii) later, on 21 May 1997, the same department issued a decision reversing the refusal, and held that the collective agreement was extended; (iv) the company sought the remedies of revocation, appeal and nullity of the decision, and (v) on 23 March 1998, the administrative authorities rejected the company's applications, and the Ministry of Labour confirmed the extension of the collective agreement signed on 15 September 1994.

The Government explains that the Internal Audit of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, a body accountable to the office of the General Treasury Inspector of the Republic, had discovered that an authorization including wage entitlements had been irregularly granted to Dr. Rojas R铆molo (this point came out during the interpretation of a Constitutional Chamber judgement relating to arbitral awards in the public sector) and had made the corresponding recommendations to rectify the situation. The administrative investigation resulted in a favourable decision for Dr. Rojas R铆molo which demonstrates, once again, the absolute transparency of the procedure and utmost respect for national procedures and legislation. A resolution dated 24 October 1996, issued by the Executive Committee of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, ordered that the administrative record of Dr. Rojas R铆molo's case be filed, since it was concluded that he had not acted in bad faith. As clearly proven, there is not and has not been any anti-union persecution against Dr. Rojas R铆molo, nor was the authorization granted revoked, nor were proceedings instituted for him to return the monies received during the validity of the authorization.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904128, response status: 200"

The strike was prompted by FERTICA's anti-union attitude: it had violated the collective agreement and refused to recognize the ATFE, replacing it with a local solidarist association which was under its control, and dismissed the members and officers of the ATFE. The ICFTU also alleges unfair working practices by FERTICA, including the hiring of new workers at a lower wage and on less favourable health and safety conditions, and the imposition of an excessively heavy workload. These violations of the law and workers rights were duly noted by Ministry of Labour inspectors who were called in specially to investigate the case. But despite the inspectors' report, nothing will be achieved in the short term since legal proceedings are notoriously slow in the Costa Rican legal system, which means that the workers and the organizations which represent them are entirely without protection (the ICFTU attaches the inspectors' report).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

Similarly, there was sufficient evidence to ascertain anti-union acts and trade union persecution and unfair practices against the Association of Workers in the Fertilizer Sector, known as the ATFE, in breach of section 363 et seq. of the Labour Code, Article 60 of the Political Constitution, and ILO Conventions Nos. 98 and 135. We therefore request that a summons be issued in accordance with the law"". With regard to the allegation of trade union persecution and unfair practices, their report indicates that the inspectors in charge of the investigation found that, on 9 September 1995, FERTICA dismissed all its workers, 265 of whom were members of the ATFE, thus totally destroying stability of employment of organized labour. The report also indicates that on 9 September 1995 FERTICA dismissed the ATFE executive, in breach of the procedure established in article 10 of the collective agreement, national standards on the protection of trade union representatives laid down in section 363 et seq. of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions Nos. 98 and 135. According to the report, as from 9 September 1995 FERTICA stopped applying the collective agreement in its entirety, in breach of the legislation governing labour relations. From the same date, all works committees established by the collective agreement were made inoperative and all workers' rights and guarantees, including trade union immunity were abolished.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

At the hearing, the latter halted the proceedings by challenging the locus standi of the trade union leader Mr. Indalecio Ordo帽ez Calvo (author of one of the complaints) as representative of the members of the organization that had submitted the complaint. By a decision of 8 January 1996, the office of the Minister revoked the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate and allowed the employer's claim.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

The hearing was held on that date, but was attended only by the workers' counsel, since FERTICA's head office had refused receipt of the summons. The outcome of the hearing is perfectly plain from the decision issued by the National Labour Inspection Directorate on 29 January 1996, which confirms the conclusions of the investigating inspectors in their report of 20 November 1995.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

On 9 September 1995, FERTICA dismissed all workers having paid them their entitlements, including 265 members of the ATFE. The decision also states that the trade union leaders Indalecio Ordo帽ez Calvo and Marco Antonio Guzm谩n Rodr铆guez have not received their pay since 10 September 1995, in breach of article 9 of the collective agreement; and with regard to the dismissal of members of the ATFE executive, FERTICA has violated article 10 of the collective agreement. The National Labour Inspection Directorate therefore allowed the ATFE's complaints of violation of the collective agreement, unfair labour practices and trade union persecution by FERTICA. Furthermore, the parties were informed that, once the decision of 29 January 1996 is confirmed, the requisite complaint will be filed with the proper jurisdictional authority.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

In this connection, the Government points out that on 21 February 1996, FERTICA applied to have the decision of 29 January 1996 revoked or, failing that, reviewed. By a decision of 8 March 1996, the National Labour Inspection Directorate dismissed the application for revocation and the other applications filed by FERTICA's representative.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

It needed the file to examine a claim of unconstitutionality filed by FERTICA SA. The Constitutional Chamber returned the original file under cover of an official letter of 13 June 1996 which also notified ruling N-2810-96 dismissing FERTICA's claim of unconstitutionality on the merits. As soon as the file was returned by the Constitutional Chamber in June 1996, the Minister of Labour gave priority to dealing with the appeal against the administrative decision of 29 January 1996. This shows that any allegation of delays on the Ministry's part is unjust, hasty and unfounded. The Ministry gave its decision on 29 July 1996: it dismissed the appeal and hence the claim for the quashing of the administrative decisions of 29 January and 8 March 1996, and the impugnment of the locus standi of the workers' representative; it also stated that the administrative means of redress had been exhausted. In addition, the National Labour Inspection Directorate was ordered to lodge a complaint without delay with the appropriate jurisdictional authority, in accordance with section 564 et seq. of the Labour Code, seeking the sanctions provided for in the existing labour legislation, without prejudice to any other measures which might be ordered. The actual claims were that the Mayor or Labour Judge, as the case may be, should order restitution of the rights which had been violated and compensation for the injury caused to the workers, in accordance with section 610 of the Labour Code. There was also an express claim for the immediate reinstatement of the workers affected and to payment of the arrears of their wages. The Government sends a copy of the complaint of 30 August 1996 seeking sanctions against FERTICA.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

This is clearly a result of hastiness and ignorance of the fact that the rule of law prevails in the country. It also reflects a disregard for the truth which leaves the country defenceless, particularly bearing in mind that not only did the National Labour Inspection Directorate intervene to settle the dispute, but so did the Labour Relations Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which attended various hearings to clarify matters related to the complaint submitted to the ILO.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

In this context the Committee notes that following a report from the labour inspectorate noting these abuses, committed in September 1995, the Ministry of Labour initiated legal proceedings with a view to penalizing FERTICA and providing compensation for the injury caused, in particular by the immediate reinstatement of the workers affected and payment of the arrears of their wages and, in general, restitution of the rights which had been violated. The Committee regrets that, according to the labour inspectors' report, FERTICA engaged in unfair practices (arbitrary annulment of the collective agreement in its entirety and anti-trade union acts and trade union persecution in the form of dismissal of the executive and 265 members of the AFTE). The Committee also regrets that, following the dismissal of the trade unionists, the firm allegedly hired new workers.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that, according to the indications in the labour inspectors' report, FERTICA's violations of the law occurred on 9 September 1995 and the above report is dated 20 November 1995. The Committee also observes that the administrative and legal actions brought by FERTICA meant that the Government was unable to go to the judicial authority before the end of August 1996 in order to obtain the penalties and compensation provided for in the legislation. The Committee notes that 11 months had passed by between the anti-union acts alleged by the complainant (September 1995) and the Ministry's judicial application for sanctions against the enterprise and compensation (end of August 1996).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903919, response status: 200"

In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that ""cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No. 98 should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and in particular a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitutes a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, 4th (revised) edition, 1996, para. 749).

According to UNEIDA and CLAT (which refer only to UNEIDA and not to the other two unions at IDA), 14 trade union officers and representatives were dismissed out of a total of 21; of these 14, nine were on the executive committee which had a total of 13 members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903876, response status: 200"

The National Board of the Labour Inspectorate is the technical body officially delegated by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to inquire into, by any means it considers necessary, infringements of legislation in connection with unfair labour practices of which it is aware.

It is relevant to note in this paragraph that in accordance with the legal system in force, the Department of Labour Relations' role in cases of this nature is to try to prevent the development of disputes between employers and workers or to reach an out-of-court agreement, if these have already occurred, at the request of any of the parties concerned; and it was within this mandate that the Department intervened.

The following resulted from the work of this committee:(a) the committee was set up with a view to analyse the actual occurrences and to determine if there had been infringements of trade union rights;(b) within the committee, the trade union sector requested that the work should confine itself specifically to the reinstatement of six former officials. The employer was in agreement to discuss this subject pointing out specifically that:- in the case of officials with temporary posts, their reinstatement would involve the creation of permanent posts which was not within the competence of the commission but that of the Budgetary Authority;- in addition to the above-mentioned consideration, there would have to be a technical examination of each case to determine, in the light of the institution's needs, whether the creation of these posts was justified;- any decision taken would require the necessary funding and comply with the standards in force regulating this area;all the above was put down in writing before the final decision and contained in the respective file;(c) at the request of the trade union sector the committee did not discuss or examine evidence on the legal or financial aspects. The examination was restricted to the technical aspect of the case;(d) as might reasonably have been expected, the positions of SENARA and the trade union sector were opposed and the Ministry of Labour's opinion was awaited to settle the dispute;(e) we were surprised by the fact that the opinion finally put forward by the Ministry of Labour referred to freedom of association; although this had been vaguely referred to by the trade unionists, this aspect was not examined within the committee and no proof was furnished in relation to this subject. Our attention was also drawn to the fact that the ministry did not merely put forward an opinion but unilaterally decided on measures to implement a decision taken which was outside the competence and scope of the committee, such as the reinstatement of two officials, thus making this decision null and void;(f) SENARA subsequently requested the opinion of the budgetary authority which considered, in the same way as SENARA, that the termination of the labour contracts was in no way related to the freedom of association of the ex-officials in question and that their reinstatement would not be in line with our legislation in force.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903833, response status: 200"

On the contrary, the complainant organizations did not, in this particular case, as stated at the beginning, exhaust all the proceedings of the National Board of the Labour Inspectorate.

It confirmed that the termination of the employment relationship of the above-mentioned former officials was consistent with the period of time for which they were appointed and did not constitute an infringement of freedom of association on the part of SENARA.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903833, response status: 200"

It is therefore totally unfounded to condemn the Government for an alleged cause of action which, up to now, has not been a subject of complaint brought before the competent administrative and legal authorities. Furthermore, it has been clearly demonstrated that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security's action was in full conformity with the law and that it took the necessary steps to attempt to safeguard workers' rights.

The Government attached a copy of the reply of the management of SENARA concerning her dismissal, which indicates that the employment relationship of Mrs. Ana N谩jera Herrera was based on a contract for a specific task and that hiring her corresponded to the needs of this task.

The SENARA institution justifies the termination of the temporary contracts of the two officials on the grounds that they had come to an end and that the project undertaken was gradually completed. SENARA denies having been prompted by anti-union feelings and points out that at the time of the events there was no dispute of a trade union nature. Finally, the Government seems to deny that the conclusions of the tripartite committee were of a binding nature and points out that those concerned did not make use of the administrative and judicial proceedings provided for under the legislation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903833, response status: 200"

The complainant organization reports that the public officials accepted the Government's offer;- the refusal to allow the union to join round-table negotiations. The complainant organization states that the administration invited trade union leaders to informal talks and information sessions on customs modernization, but only to let them know what had happened, not to ask them their opinion or give them the chance to make alternative proposals;- the persecution, obstruction and violation of the trade union autonomy (anti-union persecution) of ASEPA. In this regard, the complainant organization encloses the text of a notice which states that the judicial authorities ordered the State to pay damages in July 1994 (the complainant organization does not, however, give details of the specific actions censured nor the persons affected);- anti-union acts against the General Secretary and members of the ASEPA leadership (although the complainant organization refers to a judicial ruling ordering the State to pay damages, it has not sent the text of the verdict nor specified the anti-union acts committed);- hold-ups in cases alleging anti-union acts brought before the courts by ASEPA (the complainant organization mentions three cases in which ""delaying tactics"" are thought to have been used);- the refusal by the authorities to sign an agreement on freedom of association which has taken three years to negotiate (the complainant organization points out that it has applied to the courts for the enforcement of its constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) in this regard);- the refusal to allow ASEPA use of an official vehicle round the clock (all governments have allowed ASEPA to use an official state vehicle since it was set up).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903332, response status: 200"

In this regard, consideration should be given to Decision No. 5432-93 of the Constitutional Court concerning the application for the enforcement of constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) lodged by Mr. Lor铆a Arias, General Secretary of ASEPA, which orders that Executive Decree No. 2215-6H-93 on the implementation of the regulations governing the organization, competence and functions of the National Customs Service, should remain in force to avoid further damage to national interests. It should be pointed out that the application was changed to a legal action to have the decision to restructure declared unconstitutional, which is being considered pending a decision on its admissibility. The Government also states that the union will continue to use the centre as its office, as was the rule till now.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903332, response status: 200"

Although the customs service was restructured, a much needed measure if it were to be modernized and provide a better service to the public, it should be pointed out that officials freely chose between being transferred to other institutions and being paid the benefits due to them. The Government states that it is not aware of any active trade union leader having been affected by the restructuring process, since that was never taken into account in determining which posts should remain or be abolished in the customs system.

As a result, and in accordance with section 52 of the Act on constitutional jurisdiction, the application for the enforcement of constitutional rights (recurso de amparo) No. 676-92 was declared admissible in terms of compensation and costs, but the substance of the application was rejected because the complaint lodged by the appellant had already been dealt with and settled by the central administration. In this regard, it was proved that the officials responsible for the acts were the six people who worked at the Customs Supervisory and Inspection Body. The chief customs officer sent a report to the Office of the Minister of Finance, according to an official letter of 25 October 1994, which was passed on to the personnel department, the competent body in disciplinary matters, so that it could take appropriate action.

The Government states that the person held responsible for those actions has resigned his post in the public administration.

The Committee wishes to recall that on various occasions it has stated that ""under its mandate it is required to examine allegations concerning the violation of trade union rights, and therefore it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and processes - whether or not they imply redundancies - only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions"". At any rate, the Committee cannot but regret the failure to consult or try to reach agreement with trade union organizations on the rationalization and staff-reduction processes (see 291st Report, Case No. 1707 (Peru), paragraph 189, 286th Report, Case No. 1609 (Peru), paragraph 434, and 292nd Report, Cases Nos. 1620 and 1702 (Colombia)). The Committee notes that the restructuring referred to by the complainant organization was of a global nature, affecting many workers, not just ASEPA members. However, it does not have enough information to determine whether the complainant organization was duly consulted. Therefore, the Committee emphasizes, in general, the importance of consulting the trade union organizations concerned whenever restructuring takes place.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903332, response status: 200"

The Committee notes this information and the fact that the documentation sent by the complainant organization shows that the judicial authorities ordered the State to pay damages. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that in future senior officials are instructed to refrain from hindering the trade union activities of officials in their departments.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903332, response status: 200"

In the circumstances, while it notes that the Government affirms that the anti-union activities aimed at harassing trade union leaders have been discontinued, and that the person responsible no longer works in the public administration, the Committee emphasizes the principle that no one should be subjected to discrimination or prejudice with regard to employment because of his legitimate trade union activities or membership, and that the persons responsible for such acts should be punished.

In the circumstances, the Committee notes that the allegations are too vague and that, as it has pointed out previously, it does not have enough evidence to decide whether or not genuine consultations were held on the customs restructuring process. The Committee must therefore confine itself to emphasizing the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultations on matters of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved (see 254th Report, Case No. 1362 (Spain), para. 162).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903332, response status: 200"

As concerns the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government indicated that, in response to the Committee's recommendation, it carried out conciliation and mediation between the parties so that the agreement of 16 May 1994, including section 3 concerning dismissals, be applied. The Government pointed out, however, that Geest Caribbean Ltd. ceased operating in May 1996; it has retained its legal personality but does not employ any workers in the country. The Government adds that, by Circular DM 1428-96 of 19 June 1996 (a copy of which was annexed), the Ministry of Labour gave instructions to the Labour Inspectorate for inspectors to ensure that trade union rights be fully respected in Geest Caribbean Ltd. and in the other companies in the country, including on the plantations, as well as to guarantee that ""the standing workers' committees"" (not unionized) not interfere with the role of representatives at the undertaking. Furthermore, circular DM 2408-95 of 21 December 1995 gives priority as a matter of urgency to any investigative procedures concerning disloyal work practices contrary to trade union rights, which should be transmitted immediately to the National Labour Inspectorate Board. The Government also indicates that it is not aware of any appeal before the Constitutional Court which was referred to by SITGAH. As concerns the evolution of the procedure concerning the violent acts which occurred in May 1994 during the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government points out that the accused (former workers in the company and most of them Nicaraguans without papers) have not been found and that the procedures have been suspended, except as concerns one of them which was found to be without basis.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903080, response status: 200"

The Committee emphasizes that procedures concerning violations of Convention No. 98 should be rapid so that the necessary measures of redress may be truly effective.

It explains that since 1990 in the central district of the Sarapiqu铆 canton in the province of Heredia, Republic of Costa Rica, banana plantations have been set up, belonging to the transnational English-funded banana marketing company Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Costa Rican branch. They employ 1,100 agricultural labourers, approximately 900 of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

The employer's arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September 1993, and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer's prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers' legitimate strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for 7-21 May 1994. However, on 18 May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer's representative, moved in on the strikers, 18 of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned 35 workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer's arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than 60 workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu铆 is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zu帽iga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 135, has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its 278th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No. 7360 of 4 November 1993, which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of 4 November 1993 reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to 12 (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

With regard to ruling No. 1696-92 of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on 5 March 1993, following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly; this is part of the Bill on public employment and takes account of observations made by the ILO.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

Furthermore, the Government points out that it is willing to amend legislation on the teaching profession so that state teachers in particular and public servants in general may enjoy unrestricted trade union leave, bringing legislation into line with Convention No. 135.

During the hearing on 14 July 1992, an agreement was reached whereby the workers who had been dismissed accepted the compensation due, instead of reinstatement.The Government refutes the information relating to alleged trade union persecution in the aforementioned enterprise since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the National Labour Inspection Directorate and the National Labour Relations Directorate, has no record of any complaints, nor has it had through any other suitable channel any reliable evidence of such persecution.However, particular mention should be made of the effective intervention on the part of the Ministry, through its labour relations department, at the time of the alleged dismissals, and the subsequent favourable settlement under which compensation was paid, the minutes of the meeting showing that no reservations were entered by the trade union suggesting harassment.- The TALMANA S.A. enterprise: the labour inspector has heard the allegation made by the president of ANTEP concerning harassment of a number of workers on grounds of union membership and declared it receivable. He intends to institute the legal proceedings called for in the case of violation of labour laws. On 7 June 1993 the complainant who had appealed for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) requested that the proceedings and appeal be withdrawn, upon which the Labour Inspectorate closed the case. Subsequently, the president of ANTEP was removed from office by a workers' assembly following internal disputes in the union, and the new representative asked that proceedings be resumed. The Labour Inspectorate agreed and is in the process of investigating the new allegations.In this regard, it should be pointed out that the National Labour Inspection Directorate issued a ruling on 25 February 1993 in which it declared admissible the complaint of union persecution made against TALMANA S.A. by Mr. Carlos Acu帽a Castro, president of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). This clearly shows that the Government of Costa Rica is prepared thoroughly to investigate trade union organizations' complaints of violation of the labour laws which protect trade union activity.However, as provided by law, and authorized under the legal system, the legal representative of the TALMANA S.A. enterprise appealed against the ruling. The ruling has not become absolute, since it was challenged as described and the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP) also filed an appeal for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) against the enterprise. As things stand, it is not true that the Ministry has not become involved in the aforementioned case, bearing in mind that it has gone as far as it is allowed under the legal system and there is no evidence of voluntary omission or violation of legal provisions.- The Corporaci贸n Peter S.A. enterprise: there are no complaints of violation of freedom of association at this enterprise before the Labour Inspectorate, so it is surprising that a complaint has been made to the Committee before referring to the competent national bodies.- The Patisand S.A. enterprise: the inspection carried out at this enterprise confirmed that Elizabeth Salas had been dismissed at the time she was nursing her child, which is a violation of labour laws. A complaint was therefore lodged with the Labour Court. It was not proven that she was dismissed as a result of trade union persecution, but that this was on the aforementioned grounds.In this case, the allegation is repetitive and groundless because the case had already been referred to the Labour Inspection services, which had taken the Patisand S.A. enterprise before the courts alleging violation of labour and social security legislation.This was because it was proved that the enterprise in question failed to comply with section 94 of the Labour Code, since despite the fact that the worker was nursing her child at the time, the enterprise failed to notify the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the dismissal and thus prove the misconduct given as the reason for justified dismissal, in accordance with the Labour Code.- The Corporaci贸n Rojas Cort茅s S.A. enterprise: on the basis of inquiries carried out by the Labour Inspectorate in various establishments belonging to the enterprise, the complaint was dismissed. The decision stands firm as it has not been challenged by those concerned.More specifically, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its Labour Inspectorate and labour affairs services, has dealt with all the requests for help to establish violations of various legal provisions, including the allegations of union persecution. The latter allegations have been dismissed because it has been impossible to prove that measures designed to hinder or stamp out trade union activity have been taken. A photocopy of the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate dated 2 June 1993 and background information have been enclosed.- The Compa帽铆a Bananera Agropecuaria R铆o Jim茅nez S.A.: the ANTEP representative requested a hearing in the Ministry of Labour to discuss a number of labour issues with employers' representatives. However, this meeting did not take place as the enterprise replied that labour relations were discussed with the workers' standing committee. The Government points out that at no time did the trade union in question lodge any complaint of union persecution against the workers dismissed, mentioned by the complainant. More specifically, the Government refutes the information on alleged union persecution, since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not been informed of any such complaint. Affidavits from the National Director and General Labour Inspector are appended.- The Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprise: this case is similar to that of the Corporaci贸n Peter S.A., and Compa帽铆a Bananera Agropecuaria R铆o Jim茅nez S.A. enterprises. The Government refutes the information provided since the alleged complaint of mass dismissals, including of branch members, in addition to the fact that there is no reliable proof, has not been registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.In any case, there should be some indication of how the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry in question has dealt with the requests for intervention made by ANTEP with regard to possible bankruptcies and dismissals at the enterprise. Representatives of the enterprise and the trade union were called to a meeting and the settlement reached was satisfactory to and signed by both parties.From the above it can be concluded that the additional information in question is groundless.402.Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October 1993) and the report of the Committee of Experts, 1994, which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 135.

In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903079, response status: 200"

He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers' standing committee, the union's request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day, 21 April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On 27 April 1994 the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and 3 May 1994 because the employer's representatives failed to attend.

In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on 16 May 1994.

In the memorandum, he also provided information on the appointment by his organization of representatives to sit on the ""tripartite committee"" provided for in the document to look into the dismissals. In view of all this, the Government of Costa Rica cannot understand why the complainant organization is turning to an international body to make accusations against a government which has always been willing to deal with its problems.

On 13 May 1994: request for intervention addressed to the Department of Labour Relations by a group of workers in the SARET enterprise of Costa Rica, for the purpose of convening officials of this enterprise following the dismissal of the said workers, supposedly for holding meetings on the setting up of a trade union organization. On the same date, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security fixed the date of the conciliation hearing for 16 May 1994; on 16 May 1994, in the presence of the workers concerned, as well as trade union representatives and the legal adviser of the enterprise, and following the latter's statement that he was willing to meet again with the workers, with the mediation of the Ministry, the parties agreed to hold a new meeting on 19 May. On 19 May 1994, the employer's representative did not turn up at the agreed meeting, and for this reason the workers requested the Office of Labour Affairs to make a complaint to the General Labour Inspectorate in respect of trade union persecution against several workers who were organizing the establishment of a trade union, and their dismissal. These workers reserved the right to bring the matter before the competent courts. On 23 May 1994, the Directorate of Labour Affairs informed the SARET, S.A. enterprise of its concern at the attitude adopted by its legal adviser towards commitments entered into. The same note stated that the parties were convened to a further meeting on 26 May 1994. In addition to these initiatives, on 23 May 1994 the General Directorate of Labour Affairs, in response to an express request by the workers concerned, formally requested the General Directorate of Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to carry out an inquiry into the matter of trade union persecution; on 26 May 1994, the representatives of the workers - Movement of Costa Rican Workers - the workers concerned and the representative of the enterprise met following the convocation from the Office of Labour Affairs. The employer's representative refuted that there had been trade union persecution and refused to reinstate the dismissed workers. Given the impossibility of achieving any extra-judicial settlement, the workers rejected the employer's position and, for the purposes of exhausting the administrative procedure, recorded in a document dated 26 May 1994 that they would carry out ""all the legal and constitutional procedures on behalf of the workers' right to free organization"". In the institutional context of Costa Rica, such constitutional and legal acts are referred to the courts of justice as the only state power with the authority for the final settlement of such disputes, whether individual or collective, on matters of law or interests. In this particular case there is no record in the Ministry of Labour of any legal action taken by the workers, as required by the legal system.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903072, response status: 200"

The parties were informed that an inquiry had been initiated and were granted a period of ten working days to produce the necessary evidence. On 20 June 1994 a request was made to the Deputy Secretary of the Trade Union of Construction, Metallurgical and Related Workers (SICMA) to give the exact address at which the workers who had been the object of alleged trade union persecution could be located. On 24 June 1994 a group of 18 workers signed a document containing the reasons and evidence substantiating the complaint which had been made. On 6 July 1994, the inspector responsible for the inquiry ordered the employer to produce documents concerning the complaint within a period of eight days. On 11 July 1994, the employer's representative responded to the above-mentioned order by denying the existence of the trade union and producing in evidence certified photocopies from the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Under Act No. 7360, of 4 November 1993, section 367 of which deals with trade union protection, whenever an organization of this nature is set up or is in the process of being set up, the workers who are members of the said trade union must notify the Department of Social Organizations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the employer of their intention to set up a trade union, along with the names and status of those who in their opinion should benefit from protection against dismissal. On 3 August 1994, the inspector carrying out the inquiry requested from the General Secretary of SICMA, documentation on the establishment of the organization and the number and names of its members and notification, if any, of the existence of the trade union. On 6 September 1994, the said inspector received a communication from the representative of the enterprise which rejected all the terms of the complaint. On 9 September 1994, the inspector requested the suspension of the inquiry until the organization in question had provided the information requested on 20 June and 3 August. On 22 September 1994, the Directorate issued a resolution in which it called upon the complainant organization to furnish the information requested on 20 June and 3 August, and informed the inspector that the inquiry should continue and that his report should be delivered as soon as possible. The Government states that it is clear from the above that it had complied with its obligation of guaranteeing full freedom of association, as established in the Political Constitution, international Conventions, the Labour Code, its amendments and other related laws. The objective of all the measures taken by the administrative authorities was to protect the exercise of the right to organize by workers against the alleged acts of interference and all these measures comply with the principle of legality which governs all acts by the public administration.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903072, response status: 200"

In the same way the voluminous documentation on the administrative procedure carried out, which the Government appends to its reply, contains a communication from the trade union, dated 3 January 1995, addressed to the National Directorate of Labour Inspection which states the following:We were informed by Labour Inspector Rodriguez that he wanted to interview each and every person who had been dismissed, which we believed was correct, although it raised an objective problem, namely that each of us has to earn his living to support our families, and many of us have had to go to different parts of the country to do so, which makes it difficult to locate all our colleagues. Thus we decided to ask those colleagues with whom we had established contact to go to Inspector Rodriguez's office, but they were neither received nor interviewed by Inspector Rodriguez, which was undoubtedly prejudicial to the valuable information which these colleagues might have been able to give the inspector.Thus, although it is true that our colleagues were not interviewed, this was not due to any negligence or lack of interest, but to the material impossibility of locating persons who as a result of their compulsory dismissal have had to travel to other parts of the country to earn their living.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903072, response status: 200"

In the Committee's view, the fact that the dismissals of the trade union officials and trade unionists were made just two to five days after the setting up of their trade union and the fact that notwithstanding the statement by the enterprise in the free trade zone that it was unaware of the existence of the trade union the Government encloses in its reply a communication from the Department of Social Organizations which shows that the registration of the trade union was being processed just before the time of the dismissals, as well as the mass nature of the latter, are all clear indications of the anti-union nature of the dismissals. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take rapidly the necessary measures to enable the workers dismissed as a result of the exercise of their legitimate trade union activities to be reinstated in their jobs in the said enterprise in the free trade zone of Alajuela. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903072, response status: 200"

The employer's arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September 1993, and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer's prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers' legitimate strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for 7-21 May 1994. However, on 18 May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer's representative, moved in on the strikers, 18 of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned 35 workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer's arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than 60 workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu铆 is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zu帽iga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union.

The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 135, has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its 278th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No. 7360 of 4 November 1993, which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of 4 November 1993 reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to 12 (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

With regard to ruling No. 1696-92 of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on 5 March 1993, following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly; this is part of the Bill on public employment and takes account of observations made by the ILO.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

During the hearing on 14 July 1992, an agreement was reached whereby the workers who had been dismissed accepted the compensation due, instead of reinstatement.The Government refutes the information relating to alleged trade union persecution in the aforementioned enterprise since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the National Labour Inspection Directorate and the National Labour Relations Directorate, has no record of any complaints, nor has it had through any other suitable channel any reliable evidence of such persecution.However, particular mention should be made of the effective intervention on the part of the Ministry, through its labour relations department, at the time of the alleged dismissals, and the subsequent favourable settlement under which compensation was paid, the minutes of the meeting showing that no reservations were entered by the trade union suggesting harassment.- The TALMANA S.A. enterprise: the labour inspector has heard the allegation made by the president of ANTEP concerning harassment of a number of workers on grounds of union membership and declared it receivable. He intends to institute the legal proceedings called for in the case of violation of labour laws. On 7 June 1993 the complainant who had appealed for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) requested that the proceedings and appeal be withdrawn, upon which the Labour Inspectorate closed the case. Subsequently, the president of ANTEP was removed from office by a workers' assembly following internal disputes in the union, and the new representative asked that proceedings be resumed. The Labour Inspectorate agreed and is in the process of investigating the new allegations.In this regard, it should be pointed out that the National Labour Inspection Directorate issued a ruling on 25 February 1993 in which it declared admissible the complaint of union persecution made against TALMANA S.A. by Mr. Carlos Acu帽a Castro, president of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). This clearly shows that the Government of Costa Rica is prepared thoroughly to investigate trade union organizations' complaints of violation of the labour laws which protect trade union activity.However, as provided by law, and authorized under the legal system, the legal representative of the TALMANA S.A. enterprise appealed against the ruling. The ruling has not become absolute, since it was challenged as described and the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP) also filed an appeal for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) against the enterprise. As things stand, it is not true that the Ministry has not become involved in the aforementioned case, bearing in mind that it has gone as far as it is allowed under the legal system and there is no evidence of voluntary omission or violation of legal provisions.- The Corporaci贸n Peter S.A. enterprise: there are no complaints of violation of freedom of association at this enterprise before the Labour Inspectorate, so it is surprising that a complaint has been made to the Committee before referring to the competent national bodies.- The Patisand S.A. enterprise: the inspection carried out at this enterprise confirmed that Elizabeth Salas had been dismissed at the time she was nursing her child, which is a violation of labour laws. A complaint was therefore lodged with the Labour Court. It was not proven that she was dismissed as a result of trade union persecution, but that this was on the aforementioned grounds.In this case, the allegation is repetitive and groundless because the case had already been referred to the Labour Inspection services, which had taken the Patisand S.A. enterprise before the courts alleging violation of labour and social security legislation.This was because it was proved that the enterprise in question failed to comply with section 94 of the Labour Code, since despite the fact that the worker was nursing her child at the time, the enterprise failed to notify the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the dismissal and thus prove the misconduct given as the reason for justified dismissal, in accordance with the Labour Code.- The Corporaci贸n Rojas Cort茅s S.A. enterprise: on the basis of inquiries carried out by the Labour Inspectorate in various establishments belonging to the enterprise, the complaint was dismissed. The decision stands firm as it has not been challenged by those concerned.More specifically, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its Labour Inspectorate and labour affairs services, has dealt with all the requests for help to establish violations of various legal provisions, including the allegations of union persecution. The latter allegations have been dismissed because it has been impossible to prove that measures designed to hinder or stamp out trade union activity have been taken. A photocopy of the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate dated 2 June 1993 and background information have been enclosed.- The Compa帽铆a Bananera Agropecuaria R铆o Jim茅nez S.A.: the ANTEP representative requested a hearing in the Ministry of Labour to discuss a number of labour issues with employers' representatives. However, this meeting did not take place as the enterprise replied that labour relations were discussed with the workers' standing committee. The Government points out that at no time did the trade union in question lodge any complaint of union persecution against the workers dismissed, mentioned by the complainant. More specifically, the Government refutes the information on alleged union persecution, since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not been informed of any such complaint. Affidavits from the National Director and General Labour Inspector are appended.- The Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprise: this case is similar to that of the Corporaci贸n Peter S.A., and Compa帽铆a Bananera Agropecuaria R铆o Jim茅nez S.A. enterprises. The Government refutes the information provided since the alleged complaint of mass dismissals, including of branch members, in addition to the fact that there is no reliable proof, has not been registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.In any case, there should be some indication of how the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry in question has dealt with the requests for intervention made by ANTEP with regard to possible bankruptcies and dismissals at the enterprise. Representatives of the enterprise and the trade union were called to a meeting and the settlement reached was satisfactory to and signed by both parties.From the above it can be concluded that the additional information in question is groundless.402.Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October 1993) and the report of the Committee of Experts, 1994, which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 135. Both reports clearly and openly state the improvements which have been made in labour legislation, improvements which go even further than the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the allegations are no longer relevant or have any legal basis.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

The draft was transmitted for consultation to the representatives of the major trade unions, so that they could suggest amendments to the text and then, on the basis of consensus, the final version could be drawn up.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers' standing committee, the union's request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day, 21 April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On 27 April 1994 the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike.

In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on 16 May 1994. On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute.

In the memorandum, he also provided information on the appointment by his organization of representatives to sit on the ""tripartite committee"" provided for in the document to look into the dismissals. In view of all this, the Government of Costa Rica cannot understand why the complainant organization is turning to an international body to make accusations against a government which has always been willing to deal with its problems. Furthermore, on 20 August 1994 the Secretary-General of SITAGAH once again requested that, pursuant to labour legislation and the institution's rules of procedure, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should summon the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise with a view to resolving the following problems: follow-up to the document dated 16 May 1994 and the deduction of trade union dues, as requested by members and the trade union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902584, response status: 200"

The Government also mentioned the appeals and procedural tactics used by the parties which has delayed the outcome of the administrative procedure concerning the violation of the collective agreement, and which is still not over. As concerns the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government indicated that, in response to the Committee's recommendation, it carried out conciliation and mediation between the parties so that the agreement of 16 May 1994, including section 3 concerning dismissals, be applied. The Government pointed out, however, that Geest Caribbean Ltd. ceased operating in May 1996; it has retained its legal personality but does not employ any workers in the country. The Government adds that, by Circular DM 1428-96 of 19 June 1996 (a copy of which was annexed), the Ministry of Labour gave instructions to the Labour Inspectorate for inspectors to ensure that trade union rights be fully respected in Geest Caribbean Ltd. and in the other companies in the country, including on the plantations, as well as to guarantee that ""the standing workers' committees"" (not unionized) not interfere with the role of representatives at the undertaking. Furthermore, circular DM 2408-95 of 21 December 1995 gives priority as a matter of urgency to any investigative procedures concerning disloyal work practices contrary to trade union rights, which should be transmitted immediately to the National Labour Inspectorate Board. The Government also indicates that it is not aware of any appeal before the Constitutional Court which was referred to by SITGAH. As concerns the evolution of the procedure concerning the violent acts which occurred in May 1994 during the collective dispute at Geest Caribbean Ltd., the Government points out that the accused (former workers in the company and most of them Nicaraguans without papers) have not been found and that the procedures have been suspended, except as concerns one of them which was found to be without basis.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902509, response status: 200"

The Committee emphasizes that procedures concerning violations of Convention No. 98 should be rapid so that the necessary measures of redress may be truly effective.

The employer's arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September 1993, and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer's prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers' legitimate strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for 7-21 May 1994. However, on 18 May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer's representative, moved in on the strikers, 18 of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned 35 workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer's arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than 60 workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu铆 is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zu帽iga is authorized to speak with trade union members.

The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 135, has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its 278th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No. 7360 of 4 November 1993, which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of 4 November 1993 reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to 12 (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

With regard to ruling No. 1696-92 of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on 5 March 1993, following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly; this is part of the Bill on public employment and takes account of observations made by the ILO.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

The Government is therefore unable to comment since in order to do so an objective legal analysis would be required, which would be completely out of place in the present context.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

Furthermore, the Government points out that it is willing to amend legislation on the teaching profession so that state teachers in particular and public servants in general may enjoy unrestricted trade union leave, bringing legislation into line with Convention No. 135.

During the hearing on 14 July 1992, an agreement was reached whereby the workers who had been dismissed accepted the compensation due, instead of reinstatement.The Government refutes the information relating to alleged trade union persecution in the aforementioned enterprise since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through the National Labour Inspection Directorate and the National Labour Relations Directorate, has no record of any complaints, nor has it had through any other suitable channel any reliable evidence of such persecution.However, particular mention should be made of the effective intervention on the part of the Ministry, through its labour relations department, at the time of the alleged dismissals, and the subsequent favourable settlement under which compensation was paid, the minutes of the meeting showing that no reservations were entered by the trade union suggesting harassment.- The TALMANA S.A. enterprise: the labour inspector has heard the allegation made by the president of ANTEP concerning harassment of a number of workers on grounds of union membership and declared it receivable. He intends to institute the legal proceedings called for in the case of violation of labour laws. On 7 June 1993 the complainant who had appealed for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) requested that the proceedings and appeal be withdrawn, upon which the Labour Inspectorate closed the case. Subsequently, the president of ANTEP was removed from office by a workers' assembly following internal disputes in the union, and the new representative asked that proceedings be resumed. The Labour Inspectorate agreed and is in the process of investigating the new allegations.In this regard, it should be pointed out that the National Labour Inspection Directorate issued a ruling on 25 February 1993 in which it declared admissible the complaint of union persecution made against TALMANA S.A. by Mr. Carlos Acu帽a Castro, president of the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP). This clearly shows that the Government of Costa Rica is prepared thoroughly to investigate trade union organizations' complaints of violation of the labour laws which protect trade union activity.However, as provided by law, and authorized under the legal system, the legal representative of the TALMANA S.A. enterprise appealed against the ruling. The ruling has not become absolute, since it was challenged as described and the National Association of Private Enterprise Workers (ANTEP) also filed an appeal for enforcement of constitutional rights (amparo) against the enterprise. As things stand, it is not true that the Ministry has not become involved in the aforementioned case, bearing in mind that it has gone as far as it is allowed under the legal system and there is no evidence of voluntary omission or violation of legal provisions.- The Corporaci贸n Peter S.A. enterprise: there are no complaints of violation of freedom of association at this enterprise before the Labour Inspectorate, so it is surprising that a complaint has been made to the Committee before referring to the competent national bodies.- The Patisand S.A. enterprise: the inspection carried out at this enterprise confirmed that Elizabeth Salas had been dismissed at the time she was nursing her child, which is a violation of labour laws. A complaint was therefore lodged with the Labour Court. It was not proven that she was dismissed as a result of trade union persecution, but that this was on the aforementioned grounds.In this case, the allegation is repetitive and groundless because the case had already been referred to the Labour Inspection services, which had taken the Patisand S.A. enterprise before the courts alleging violation of labour and social security legislation.This was because it was proved that the enterprise in question failed to comply with section 94 of the Labour Code, since despite the fact that the worker was nursing her child at the time, the enterprise failed to notify the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the dismissal and thus prove the misconduct given as the reason for justified dismissal, in accordance with the Labour Code.- The Corporaci贸n Rojas Cort茅s S.A. enterprise: on the basis of inquiries carried out by the Labour Inspectorate in various establishments belonging to the enterprise, the complaint was dismissed. The decision stands firm as it has not been challenged by those concerned.More specifically, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its Labour Inspectorate and labour affairs services, has dealt with all the requests for help to establish violations of various legal provisions, including the allegations of union persecution. The latter allegations have been dismissed because it has been impossible to prove that measures designed to hinder or stamp out trade union activity have been taken. A photocopy of the decision of the National Labour Inspection Directorate dated 2 June 1993 and background information have been enclosed.- The Compa帽铆a Bananera Agropecuaria R铆o Jim茅nez S.A.: the ANTEP representative requested a hearing in the Ministry of Labour to discuss a number of labour issues with employers' representatives. However, this meeting did not take place as the enterprise replied that labour relations were discussed with the workers' standing committee. The Government points out that at no time did the trade union in question lodge any complaint of union persecution against the workers dismissed, mentioned by the complainant. More specifically, the Government refutes the information on alleged union persecution, since the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has not been informed of any such complaint. Affidavits from the National Director and General Labour Inspector are appended.- The Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprise: this case is similar to that of the Corporaci贸n Peter S.A., and Compa帽铆a Bananera Agropecuaria R铆o Jim茅nez S.A. enterprises. The Government refutes the information provided since the alleged complaint of mass dismissals, including of branch members, in addition to the fact that there is no reliable proof, has not been registered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.In any case, there should be some indication of how the Department of Labour Relations of the Ministry in question has dealt with the requests for intervention made by ANTEP with regard to possible bankruptcies and dismissals at the enterprise. Representatives of the enterprise and the trade union were called to a meeting and the settlement reached was satisfactory to and signed by both parties.From the above it can be concluded that the additional information in question is groundless.402.Furthermore, the Government points out that the trade union organizations have gone as far as presenting complaints to an international body relating to situations which they made no attempt to resolve in due form by, first of all, exhausting national procedures. It is obvious that many of these problems could have been avoided if they had availed themselves of these procedures. In reality, and as has been observed, when they did refer disputes to the courts, the latter correctly applied both the ordinary law and ILO Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed.

The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers' standing committee, the union's request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day, 21 April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On 27 April 1994 the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and 3 May 1994 because the employer's representatives failed to attend.

In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on 16 May 1994. On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute.

Thanks to his diligence, the parties reached an acceptable agreement in the interests of industrial peace in the Sarapiqu铆 area."" ""Both parties"" means the Geest Caribbean Americas enterprise and the SITAGAH trade union.

According to a memorandum dated 16 June 1994 after the complaint referred to in this report had been lodged, the Secretary-General of SITAGAH asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to review the procedures for examining dismissals, as provided for in item 3 of the document dated 16 May. In the memorandum, he also provided information on the appointment by his organization of representatives to sit on the ""tripartite committee"" provided for in the document to look into the dismissals. In view of all this, the Government of Costa Rica cannot understand why the complainant organization is turning to an international body to make accusations against a government which has always been willing to deal with its problems. Furthermore, on 20 August 1994 the Secretary-General of SITAGAH once again requested that, pursuant to labour legislation and the institution's rules of procedure, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should summon the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise with a view to resolving the following problems: follow-up to the document dated 16 May 1994 and the deduction of trade union dues, as requested by members and the trade union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902500, response status: 200"

The Government indicates that in Costa Rica it is not only the solidarist associations who administer or participate in the management of the termination funds. There is no factual or legal monopoly in favour of the solidarist movement in this area, or discrimination against the trade union movement. What has happened in reality is that a normative process has begun, through collective labour agreements, which governs trade union participation in the administration of the termination funds of the workers. An example of this is the collective agreements concluded in the Grecia municipality, in the Council for the Administration of Ports and Development of the Atlantic Zone (JAPDEVA in Spanish) and in the Costa Rican Petroleum Refinery (RECOPE), where clauses covering this very point have been included.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901807, response status: 200"

This shows that, despite the existence of a higher number of registered solidarist associations, in a process of joining together, the number of workers affiliated to unions is in fact the higher. The Government also sends statistics on the number of collective agreements and direct settlements by branch of activities and indicates that, in total, there are also more collective agreements than direct settlements (the Government no doubt refers to the total number of collective agreements and direct settlements throughout the period under examination). According to the Government's statistics, in 1986 there were 335 unions (having 138,583 members) and 862 solidarist associations (having 32,143 members) and in 1990, 420 unions (with 154,469 members) and 1,154 solidarist associations (with 113,879 members); as for collective agreements and direct settlements, in 1980-81, 85 collective agreements and 24 direct settlements were concluded, in 1986-87, 44 collective agreements and 67 direct settlements, and in 1990 to 9 February 1991, 32 collective agreements and 40 direct settlements were signed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901807, response status: 200"

In addition, according to the mission report which cites government sources, the total number of current collective agreements in the private sector alone is 15, whereas there are 87 direct settlements. The Committee also notes that according to the mission report: ""The interference by solidarist associations in trade union activities was shown to the mission by representatives of the Government, of the academic world, or by union representatives and employer representatives and at least by a portion of the solidarist representatives interviewed."" The mission report goes on: ""In particular, the President and the First Vice-President of the Republic agreed that, in practice, solidarism was carrying out trade union functions and that it was necessary to separate by law their roles. Government authorities gave assurances that there was a willingness to adopt shortly appropriate legislative or other types of measures to guarantee the real separation of functions between unions and solidarist associations.""","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901807, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that, according to the mission report, there was ""evidence from trade unions and from labour authorities that dismissals and other prejudicial acts based on trade union reasons had taken place and were continuing to take place"". The mission report ""noted wide consensus on the need to introduce detailed and appropriate legislation regarding trade union immunity (fuero sindical) which would grant effective protection. The Government, and in particular the President of the Republic, demonstrated the greatest willingness towards adopting effective legislation along these lines. The employers were not opposed to the principle of protection of trade union leaders (although they had misgivings regarding certain modalities) as long as the obligations concerning their leadership were laid out"". The Committee also notes that there is currently draft legislation elaborated by the Ministry of Labour which would considerably strengthen the fines for violations of the Labour Code and which would establish a new system.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901807, response status: 200"

In this respect, the Committee observes that for a solidarist association to be formed 12 workers were needed, whereas a union required 20; and yet most enterprises in Costa Rica employed barely 20 workers or less. The Committee also observes that, according to the mission report, ""There was wide agreement (Government, trade union organisations and employer organisations) on the need to abolish the discrimination which presently existed concerning the termination funds between workers who were members of a solidarist association and other workers; this could be done through legislation which extended the advantages contained in the Act on Solidarist Associations and which would declare access to such funds as a right of all workers, no matter how their employment relationship had been terminated"".","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901807, response status: 200"

The Committee also considers that, since solidarist associations are financed partly by employers, are comprised of workers but also of senior staff and personnel having the employers' confidence and are often started up by employers, they cannot play the role of independent organisations in the collective bargaining process, a process which should be carried out between an employer (or an employers' organisation) and one or more workers' organisations totally independent of each other. This situation therefore gives rise to problems in the application of Article 2 of Convention No. 98 which sets out the principle of full independence of workers' organisations in carrying out their activities. The Committee therefore expresses the hope that the Government will urgently take the necessary legislative measures and other measures to guarantee that solidarist associations do not get involved in trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901807, response status: 200"

It concludes that this situation does not provide adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination as set out in Article 1 of Convention No. 98. The Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations is of the opinion that the law concerning protection against anti-union discrimination is not in conformity with Article 1 of Convention No. 98.

The complainant organisation has raised questions concerning the existence and development of the so-called ""solidarist associations"" and the regulations governing them from the point of view of their conformity with Conventions Nos. 87 and 98. In particular the complainant has alleged that the solidarist associations are controlled by employers, aim to destroy the trade union movement and have given rise to a number of anti-union practices which, in recent years, have resulted in a considerable weakening of the trade union movement and the disappearance of many trade union organisations, presenting voluminous documentation to this effect. The Government has stressed that the solidarist movement is an expression of the constitutional right of association and that the growing popularity of the solidarist movement at the expense of the trade union movement is due in many cases to internal factors of trade union management which are beyond the competence of the Government. The latter denies the allegation that the solidarist associations have been set up by law as a means of manipulation by sectors outside the working class and that workers are obliged by law to belong to these associations. Lastly, the Government points out that section 8 of the Act respecting solidarist associations provides that such associations, their executive and administrative bodies and their legal representatives may not undertake any type of activity aimed at preventing or in any way impeding the establishment and operation of trade union and co-operative organisations, and that failure to comply with this provision is punishable by the dissolution of the association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901805, response status: 200"

Section 4 defines the associations as follows:Solidarist associations are bodies of indeterminate duration which have their own legal personality and which, to achieve their purposes (the promotion of justice and social peace, harmony between employers and workers and the general advancement of their members), may acquire goods of all kinds, conclude any type of contract and undertake legal operations of any sort aimed at improving their members' social and economic conditions so as to raise their standard of living and enhance their dignity. To this effect they may undertake savings, credit and investment operations and any other financially viable operations. They may also organise programmes in the areas of housing, science, sport, art, education and recreation, cultural and spiritual matters and social and economic affairs and any other programme designed legally to promote co-operation between workers and between workers and their employers.Section 18 of the Act lists the income of solidarist associations as coming from the following:(a) The members' minimum monthly savings, the percentage of which shall be determined by the general meeting. The percentage may in no case be less than 3 per cent nor more than 5 per cent of the remuneration ... Members may save a higher sum or percentage voluntarily ... Members authorise their employer to deduct the relevant amount from their remuneration and to pay it to the association ...(b) The employer's monthly contribution on behalf of his workers, which shall be determined by common agreement between the two sides in accordance with solidarist principles ...442.The Committee expresses its serious concern at the weakening of the trade union movement in Costa Rica and the considerable decline in the number of trade union organisations in recent years. It appears to the Committee on the evidence so far available that these phenomena are connected with the development of solidarist associations. The Committee emphasises in this connection the fundamental importance of the principle of tripartism advocated by the ILO, which presupposes organisations of workers and of employers which are independent of each other and of the public authorities. Given the importance of this principle, the Committee expresses the hope that the Government will take measures, in consultation with the trade union confederations, to create the necessary conditions for strengthening the independent trade union movement and for developing its activities in the social field.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901805, response status: 200"

These are criminal offences punishable by one or two years' imprisonment.

The case was subsequently tried by the Third Criminal Court of San Jos茅, which rendered judgement No. 42-87 of 6 March 1987, which concluded that there had been no disobedience, contempt or incitement to collective dereliction of public duties (punishable crimes according to sections 305, 307 and 334 of the Penal Code), since it could not be proved during the trial and in the course of public oral debate that the trade union leaders Luis Arturo Chaves Alvarado and Johnny Garc铆a Campos had committed such punishable acts; they were therefore acquitted, together with the other defendants.

Consequently, the executive authorities played no part whatsoever in the proceedings taken against the teachers who took part in a strike that had been declared illegal. The letter admits that a number of trade union premises were searched, with a legal warrant, at the request of a representative of the State Prosecutor's Office since the law was looking for written proof of the connection between the trade union and the offence covered by article 333 of the Penal Code. The searches were carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Penal Procedure and the trade union representatives in question have so far not proved that any administrative irregularities or abuse of power by the authorities occurred. The letter also refers to the statements made by the Government concerning the illegal nature of the strike in the public services, and points out that article 333 of the Penal Code, in respect of the collective abandonment of work by public servants or employees, causing prejudice to their service, is similar to article 330 of the Italian Penal Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901360, response status: 200"

The trade unionists in question were prosecuted under Costa Rican law for having taken part in a strike and the premises of their trade union were searched to discover the link between the trade union and the strike. The Government does not deny the facts, but explains that in accordance with Costa Rican law, teachers are public sector employees who do not enjoy the right to strike.

Consequently the Committee, like the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considers that any prohibition or restriction should be confined to public servants acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority or to essential services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population. (See 230th Report, Case No. 1173, (Canada/British Columbia), para. 577, and Case No. 1225 (Brazil), para. 668.) The Committee considers that the teachers do not come under this category.

The Committee requests the Government to supply full and detailed information on the results of the inquiries that have been undertaken and to indicate whether any procedure exists for application to the courts concerning any administrative decision that may be taken in the matter. In order to avoid the danger of serious limitations on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, cases involving a challenge to the results of trade union elections should not - pending the final outcome of the proceedings - have the effect of paralysing the operations of trade unions. The Committee hopes that the measures taken by the Government will be lifted and that the workers' representatives who won the ANEP elections in August 1984 will be authorised to fulfil their duties in full freedom until a decision on the validity of the elections is reached and that, if necessary, an appeal may be made to the courts for a final decision in the matter.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901331, response status: 200"

It took those measures pending the outcome of an appeal lodged by one of the Association's members against the assembly that elected the members of the governing board. The case is therefore one of suspension of trade union activities by administrative order. This suspension violates freedom of association because it obstructs or prevents, albeit provisionally, the free functioning of the Association and restricts the right of association. The Ministry was empowered only to verify compliance with the legal requirements that the documentation must satisfy (a rule implied in section 344 of the Labour Code), for any questions that may arise between the members concerning anomalies in the assembly which do not appear in the record must be settled by the members before the labour courts. There is certainly no specific rule to that effect, but suspension of the registration of the governing board on grounds unconnected with the formalities of the documentation itself amounts to depriving the trade union of its legal existence pending an administrative ruling in a dispute which is of a judicial nature since the union cannot function without its executive organ (section 347, ibid). The foregoing criterion does not conflict with the provisions of section 337 already mentioned and section 47 of the Ministry of Labour Organisation Act because, although it is the Ministry's duty to watch over social organisations in order to ensure that they function strictly in accordance with the law, this does not imply freedom to take measures which prevent the normal activity of the body. Consequently, the measures referred to above are in breach of sections 10, 50, 11 and 153 of the Political Constitution.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901331, response status: 200"

Similarly, the practice followed by the Department of Social Organisations since the delivery of the aforementioned judgement has been to register the appointment of new executive committees as it occurs, without awaiting the outcome of any judicial proceedings challenging such appointments.

The Government supplies a copy of his objection from which it appears that he disputes the election proceedings on the following grounds: the electoral committee criticised the candidates presented by Mr. Bazo's fa ction within the ANEP; the ballot paper presented by the other faction in the ANEP contained the names of candidates who were not workers employed by the State, which is contrary to ANEP's constitution, some ANEP officers delayed processing membership applications of 450 prospective members which were lodged by representatives of Mr. Bazo's faction 15 days before the date fixed for the general assembly; some ANEP officers concealed the general list of voters from representatives of Mr. Bazo's faction until 23 August 1984 and the additional list was not presented until 25 August; these lists contained serious errors such as the repetition of the same name or identity number and the inclusion of persons who did not have the right to vote; the electoral committee met in the same place as the elections.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901333, response status: 200"

According to the Government, bills were posted depicting the Minister as having committed a series of ""offences"". Without the Minister having so requested, the authorities decided to watch the ANEP headquarters with a view to seizing this offensive propaganda. Consequently, on 14 November 1984 the following persons were apprehended carrying about 500 posters ready for distribution throughout the country: V铆ctor Arce Quesada, Franklin Benavides Flores, Rafael A.

Generally, it has been considered that the principles of freedom of association do not preclude outside control of the internal activities of an organisation if it is alleged that the law or rules have been infringed. Since measures taken by the administrative authorities are liable to be arbitrary, however, the supervisory bodies have considered that, while inquiries may be necessary in cases where irregularities have occurred or are alleged, such questions should be referred to the judicial authorities in order to guarantee an expeditious, impartial and objective procedure.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901333, response status: 200"

In this connection, the Committee has stated in previous cases (See, for example, 230th Report, Case No. 1134 (Cyprus), para. 389.) that in order to avoid the danger of serious limitations on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, cases in which the results of trade union elections are challenged should not - pending the final outcome of the proceedings - have the effect of paralysing the operations of trade unions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901333, response status: 200"

During these days, the strikers' attitude was one of open dialogue and co-operation.- On the day of the events which led up to the death of Franklin Guzman an unusual number of strikers had gathered together from early in the day in the place where the event took place - some 200 at the time of the confrontation.- Only 20 civil guards, compared with a massive number of strikers, took part in the attack. The few civil guards who were attacked exhausted the means at their disposal for dissuading the strikers from continuing, as they had with them only a small number of tear-gas bombs. In the final resort, finding themselves practically surrounded by hostile workers and with several of their companions injured by stones thrown from various parts of the undergrowth, the civil guards used their regulation weapons, shooting into the air to intimidate the strikers and get them to disperse, which is what eventually happened.- At no time during these disturbances did the officers or privates who were present see any worker fall after being shot. It was only an hour after the confrontation had ended that a bus arrived on the scene carrying Mr. Guzman who was injured but still alive, and who died shortly after entering the Ciudad Neuilly hospital to which he was taken by police car.- The worker who died had been obliged to join the strike movement in the early hours of the morning, when he was practically dragged from his house, despite his wife's protests, to join the strike.- According to a verbal statement from the doctor at the Ciudad Neuilly hospital, who is a specialist in injuries of this kind, the wounded man's death was in fact due to the delay in taking him to the health centre since his life could have been saved by timely medical intervention and he could then have been sent to a hospital with a specialised medical and surgical team in San Jos茅.- In the confrontation Mr. Freddy Bustamante Mata, Mr. Jos茅 P茅rez P茅rez, Mr. Lorenzo Mu帽oz Esquivel and Mr. Eusebio Ruiz Noguera were also injured. Nevertheless in no case were the injuries caused by shots fired by the police.- With regard to the events of 15 August 1984, which ended with the death of Mr. Luis Rosales Villegas, the facts were as follows: a noisy group of workers were on the Palmar banana plantations Nos. 2 and 4, seeking to bar the way of the civil guard authorities and throwing stones and sticks at them and at some houses, presumably those of the workers who had not joined the strike. In these circumstances and in order to safeguard private property, individuals and themselves, the civil guards after exhausting the possibilities of dialogue and persuasion had no alternative but to use tear gas. As this did not have the desired effect, they resorted to firing shots in the air.- In all the cases of confrontation the civil guard were undertaking routine duties at the time of the attack and there was no question of any operation prepared with the deliberate intention of repressing the strike movement. The injuries that occurred were all caused by the confusion arising out of the said confrontation and never as a result of isolated or deliberate action by the civil guard.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901321, response status: 200"

The Committee observes in this connection that the Government has furnished the text of court decisions declaring the illegality of the strike started by banana workers on 10 July 1984 for failing to meet the legal requirements: in particular because the trade union had not followed the conciliation and arbitration procedure provided for by law and because trade unionists had prevented workers who wished to continue working from having access to their workplaces. The Committee notes that, according to the court decisions referred to and the Labour Code, the workers of the Banana Company of Costa Rica may exercise the right to strike and the arbitration procedure takes place only by agreement between the parties.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901321, response status: 200"

In these circumstances the Committee considers that the declaration that the strike started on 10 July 1984 by the banana workers was illegal cannot be objected to from the point of view of the principles of freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901321, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the exact form or circumstances of these two deaths have not been established and that the civil guards played no part in these deaths.

In the case of Mr. Franklin Guzman, the Government states that he was brought by bus, injured but still alive, to the place where the confrontation had taken place between the strikers and the police on 10 July 1984, an hour after the confrontation had ceased.

Although the case was, relatively speaking, won by Guido N煤帽ez at first instance, the Court stated:""There is no claim to lost wages under section 82 of the Labour Code because, although the offence with which the plaintiff was charged was not sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal, the fact is that, in the opinion of the undersigned, there was always a disrespect for the employer's representatives ..."". Later in the same judgement, the Court explained that the plaintiff had uttered his expressions with ""animus defendendi"" and not with ""animus injuriandi"", and on that ground it declared the dismissal null and void. Both parties appealed against the judgement delivered at first instance inasmuch as the plaintiff, among other petitions, asked for reinstatement, which had been refused at first instance; then the Superior Labour Court declared: ""And there is no doubt that, in view of the foregoing, the conclusion reached is that the grounds for dismissal were not met because the ""intention to insult"" was lacking, since the expression was framed in general terms, without specifying persons ..."". For these reasons the Court considered that, although the offence had been committed, dismissal was not the right penalty in view of the circumstances surrounding the case.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901278, response status: 200"

The Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice concluded on 3 October 1984 that ""in view of the phrases which occur repeatedly in the dossier - and which therefore need not be repeated - if we take into account this background, the plaintiff's position in defence of the workers and what he said in this letter in, perhaps, rather rough phrases, the truth is that he did not address them to a particular person or persons but in general terms to those running the Company. In these circumstances, there were insufficient grounds for punishing the plaintiff with dismissal rather than a disciplinary penalty of another magnitude, because the truth is that he did not use those phrases in his personal capacity ... . Therefore he must be excused payment of the costs because, although he committed the offence, it was not of such gravity as to warrant his removal from his post, in this case owing to the circumstances surrounding the events"".

In this connection, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination - as set out in Convention No. 98 - is accorded by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the true reason for the dismissal is his trade union membership or activity. This in fact means that an employer, by paying compensation, can dismiss any member of his staff, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials who, in order to be able to carry out their duties in full independence, must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (see, for example, 211th Report, Case No. 1053 (Dominican Republic), para. 163).

Consequently, the worker commits mistakes for which he is often penalised, giving a pretext to dismiss him without paying any compensation whatsoever and without calling into question the employers' responsibility. The complainant adds that on several occasions, the management of the undertaking has offered money to a worker suspected of belonging to a trade union in exchange for the names of other trade union members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901135, response status: 200"

From then on workers began leaving the SITRACHIRI in large numbers and at the same time joining the UTRAL, whose membership now includes 400 out of the 500 workers of the Chiriqui Land Company.

According to the complainant, both before and after the strike began the following incidents occurred, which it considers violations of trade union rights:- days before the strike was called, the plantations were occupied and controlled by three companies of the civil guard; 43 workers were detained, as were the members of a CUT delegation who had travelled to plantation 97 for the purposes of familiarising themselves with the facts and offering their solidarity. According to the complainant, the civil guard detained the trade union leaders Luis Carlos Montero, Jes煤s Garbanzo, Jes煤s Campos, Felipe Rodriguez, Herminio Dover and Mauricio Solana, following a skirmish with the civil guard. The complainant does admit, however, that some of the workers possessed small calibre weapons which they used for hunting in the region. Furthermore, in plantation 96, after the workers had held a meeting with their leaders, the latter together with the majority of the workers were detained. The complainant declares that the total number of trade union leaders and workers detained amounted to 250;- at 10 a.m. on 19 January 1982 a worker named Narciso Morales Valdelomar was shot and later died. One of his children, a daughter aged 5, had her leg shattered by a gunshot and Juan Luis Aguilar, a negotiator and former executive of SITRACHIRI, was also wounded;- the civil guard forced striking workers on several occasions to return to their work posts, and the homes of many of them were broken into with, in some cases, the doors being forced with the butts of guns;- as a result of the strike, foreign workers, with and without residence permits, were expelled from the country and many workers were dismissed. According to the complainant the civil guard also detained a delegation of trade union leaders comprising Dr. Marielos Giralt Berm煤dez (Vice-President of the CUT), Ignacio Robles Oropeza (General Secretary of the Workers' Union of the University of Costa Rica) and other trade union leaders who were bringing food to relieve the inhuman situation in which the dismissed workers found themselves. These persons have been able to confirm that the conditions in which they and the others were detained were extremely distressing (minimum conditions of existence, psychological torture and sexual assault).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900771, response status: 200"

This investigation found that there had been violations of Convention No. 87 and in particular management interference in the organisation and conduct of trade union activities. The Government adds that as the management of the Institute had paid no heed to the request of the labour inspector that the ASTRAA be permitted to use the premises and be granted similar facilities to those it had previously enjoyed, the Minister of Labour ordered the Labour Inspectorate to institute legal proceedings with a view to obtaining the imposition of the sanctions provided for in cases of non-observance of the labour laws, the outcome of which will be communicated to the Committee. However, the Government states that in the light of the investigations carried out by the Labour Inspectorate it can be concluded that the civil guard were not called in to eject the trade unionists from the premises.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900771, response status: 200"

As to the validity of the collective agreement concluded between the Chiriqui Land Company and SITRACHIRI, the Government states that it was legally registered after the Ministry's legal assistant had declared that it complied with the labour provisions in force. The Government adds that, according to the legislation in force, case law and doctrine, it is not possible for the Ministry to intervene at the request of a trade union body other than the one signing the collective agreement in question with a view to obtaining the management's agreement to negotiate a new draft collective agreement. Nevertheless, continues the Government, the point of view expressed by the complainant organisation in declaring the collective agreement in force to be a ""pseudo agreement"" is very subjective. Proof of this is the fact, for example, that the basic wage rate approved in this collective agreement at the time of its registration was the highest in all the country's banana plantations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900771, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that the Minister of Labour ordered the Labour Inspectorate to institute legal proceedings against the Institute with a view to obtaining the imposition of the penalties in force for non-observance of the labour laws. In these circumstances, the Committee can only urge the Government to continue to do all in its power to ensure that, as soon as possible, the ASTRAA is enabled to use its trade union premises once again and to request it to inform the Committee of the outcome of the proceedings instituted against the Costa Rican Institute of Water Supply and Sewerage.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900771, response status: 200"

The Committee considers in this regard that it cannot form conclusions as to the validity of the said collective agreement, not only because it does not have sufficient information, but also because of the time that elapsed between the date on which the collective agreement was signed (8 September 1981) and that on which the complainant formulated the allegations (26 April 1982), a period of more than six months during which the collective agreement had in principle been in effect without apparently any of the parties having appealed to the courts with a view to contesting its validity. In this regard, the Committee recalls, as it has pointed out on previous occasions, that recognition by an employer of the main unions represented in his undertaking or the most representative of these unions is the very basis for any procedure for collective bargaining on conditions of employment at the level of the undertaking. The Committee has already insisted that the competent authorities must take appropriate conciliatory measures with a view to obtaining such recognition by the employer concerned.,","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900771, response status: 200"

Faced with this abnormal situation whereby the workers were attempting to obtain representation by force and illegally in order to sign a new collective agreement, the Government declared the movement illegal in exercise of its lawful powers.

However, according to the complainant, when Mr. G贸mez became a union member and denounced the illegal persecutions imposed by the enterprise, which refused to draw up and enforce internal works rules, he was dismissed on a false accusation of drunkenness. As regards the dismissal of the secretary for training, Mr. Fern谩ndez Gim茅nez, the complainants explained that he was dismissed on grounds of ""reorganisation"" whereas his own supervisors had stated that ""in view of his output, he could keep his job and would not be dismissed during the reorganisation that was to take place"". One month later, nevertheless, he was dismissed on the grounds of reorganisation. In the complainants' view, the true reason for this dismissal originated in the fact that Fern谩ndez Gim茅nez had come to the assistance of a group of peasants who were being forced by their boss, Mr. Hern谩ndez, in teams of 12 workers to spray 80 bags of fertilizer which, in the climatic conditions in which the work is performed, constitutes unfair and inhumane condition of work.

These duties were judged to be incompatible with his trade union membership. The Government states that the employer, like the ministry of Labour, considered that his membership was prejudicial to the exclusive loyalty owed by a senior executive to the interests he represented and which he must scrupulously respect. Faced with this breach of trust, the enterprise decided to terminate the contract of employment of Claudio Gamboa. However, the Government adds, neither the enterprise nor the authorities subjected him to any discrimination whatsoever. On the contrary, on 3 December 1981, the Executive appointed him as one of the workers' members of the National Wages Council for the period 1982-86, as attested by Decree No. 173 TSS of 3 December 1981, a copy of which is attached to the Government's communication.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900616, response status: 200"

In these circumstances, these staff cannot be classified as staff having permanent contracts, so that criteria of anti-union discrimination can be applied to it, as the complainant seeks to show. Thus, the permanent contracts which do exist in the firm are limited to other categories of persons who were not affected by the dismissals.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900616, response status: 200"

According to the complainant, the Tempisque Sugar Works launched a campaign of persecution against unionised workers by dismissing union leaders and militants on the pretext that the sugar cane harvest was over. On the other hand, according to the Government some of the dismissals were for specific reasons: Santos G贸mez Hern谩ndez was dismissed for turning up for work several times in a state of drunkenness and Claudio Gamboa Valverde for engaging in trade union activities, when at the same time as chief industrial relations officer, he occupied a position of trust in the management of the enterprise; others took place for economic reasons: this was the case of the workers mentioned by the complainant, including the trade union leader, Alfonso Fern谩ndez Gim茅nez.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900616, response status: 200"

The Committee points out that, as far as cases of dismissals for economic reasons are concerned, acts of anti-union discrimination ought not to occur under the pretext of such circumstances.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900616, response status: 200"

The Committee on Freedom of Association, for its part, has several times pointed out as regards Costa Rica the need to make explicit provision in the legislation for appeal procedures and sanctions to ensure the effective application of Article 1 of Convention No. 98. The Committee therefore considers that one way of protecting trade unionists is to provide that they cannot be dismissed either during the performance of their duties or for a certain period of time after the expiry of their mandate unless a serious offence has been committed. A further means of ensuring effective protection for workers would be to make it compulsory for each employer to prove that the motive of his intention to dismiss a worker has no connection with the worker's union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900616, response status: 200"

As far as this person is concerned, the Committee considers that his dismissal is not an infringement of freedom of association. On the other hand, according to the Government, another leader was dismissed for belonging to the union at the same time as he occupied a position of trust in the management of the enterprise. On this point, the Committee, like the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considers that the right to join joint organisations with the rest of the workers of the enterprise can be denied to management staff and persons holding positions of trust on condition that they can join their own organisation.

One month later, nevertheless, he was dismissed on grounds of reorganisation. The complainant states that the true reasons for his dismissal were the following. A group of peasants had asked Mr. Fern谩ndez Gim茅nez for the union's help because their boss, Mr. Hern谩ndez, was obliging each team of 12 workers to spray 80 bags of fertilizer which, in the climatic conditions in which the work is performed, constitutes unfair and inhumane conditions of work.

In this connection the Committee must point out that such a large number of dismissals (the undertaking had 114 workers) on the occasion of labour disputes involves serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association and may impair the development of labour relations. For this reason the Committee feels that it would be advisable to take measures to review the situation of the dismissed workers as far as possible, particularly any workers who have been dismissed from their posts for reasons connected with their trade union activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900308, response status: 200"

The employer was accordingly entitled to terminate the contracts of employment of the strikers (section 370 of the Labour Code), and the courts had the power to order the police authorities to guarantee the continuation of work (section 381 of the Labour Code). Given the consequences of the illegal strike, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, with a view to ensuring social peace, decided to act as a mediator; the result of this action was a settlement between the parties on the basis of proposals by the Government concerning reinstatement of the workers, termination of individual contracts and statutory benefits, trade union activity and the establishment of a Labour Relations Board.

At a certain moment, Alvaro Picado, who was driving a vehicle equipped with a mechanical shovel, pushed with the shovel a loading vehicle against a but containing a number of policemen. The Government adds that the police fired into the air and warned the strikers to stop the violence. It was then discovered that Alvaro Picado, who was to die later, was lying on the ground with a bullet wound.

As regards the death of the worker, Alvaro Picado, the Committee observes that the allegations of the complainant and the statement of the Government are contradictory; the complainant states that a member of the forces of order fired on unarmed workers, although there had been no clashes either with the forces of order or with the strike-breakers, whereas the Government states that the workers had committed acts of aggression and that it was not possible to determine whether the shot which caused the victim's death came from the police. As it has already done on similar occasions, the Committee wishes to recall that it has always attached great importance to the institution of an impartial inquiry and the guarantee of due process of law in order to determine responsibilities and apply the corresponding sanctions in cases where disturbances have occurred involving the loss of human lives, In this sense the Committee observes that a preliminary investigation was carried out and that one of the civil guards was acquitted for lack of evidence.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900306, response status: 200"

Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers (1974 and 1975) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August 1976 had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acu帽a Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acu帽o Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900039, response status: 200"

It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article 2 of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation.

These events occurred in 1976 and 1977. According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Z煤帽iga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Z煤帽iga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July 1976 at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900039, response status: 200"

The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900039, response status: 200"

He had been dismissed in February 1977, according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November 1978 the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900039, response status: 200"

As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October 1976 that he was discharged on 1 March 1976 by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May 1978 state that he was dismissed in February 1976 by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900039, response status: 200"

Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Z煤帽iga on charges of riot and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some 600 workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900039, response status: 200"

These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work 11 times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal. In the case in question, according to the judgement, the repeated absences did not coincide with any of the hearings of the conciliation tribunal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900039, response status: 200"

The Committee has nevertheless stated that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances.

According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acu帽a Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on 17 June 1975 from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acu帽a Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristi谩n Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on 24 February 1977, after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900042, response status: 200"

Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos茅 had judged that the suit filed by Acu帽a Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On 18 August 1976, the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acu帽a Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acu帽a Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900042, response status: 200"

However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on 24 February 1977 and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900042, response status: 200"

Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.

The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section 15 of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. 98, by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900041, response status: 200"

The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August 1976 had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acu帽a Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acu帽o Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899984, response status: 200"

It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article 2 of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation.

According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Z煤帽iga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Z煤帽iga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July 1976 at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899984, response status: 200"

He had been dismissed in February 1977, according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work.

In November 1978 the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities.

As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October 1976 that he was discharged on 1 March 1976 by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May 1978 state that he was dismissed in February 1976 by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899984, response status: 200"

Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Z煤帽iga on charges of riot and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some 600 workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899984, response status: 200"

These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work 11 times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal.

According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acu帽a Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on 17 June 1975 from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acu帽a Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristi谩n Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on 24 February 1977, after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899987, response status: 200"

Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos茅 had judged that the suit filed by Acu帽a Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On 18 August 1976, the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acu帽a Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment.

It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899987, response status: 200"

Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.

The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section 15 of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. 98, by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899986, response status: 200"

In this document, the Inspector concluded that on the basis of the evidence produced ""there was persecution of the workers forming the union's executive council"". The matter was transmitted to a higher authority but, whilst the necessary complaints were being prepared for submission to the courts, the company filed a bankruptcy petition with the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. Considering that it was of little importance to pursue the complaint for anti-trade union discrimination, but that it was more important to solve the serious social problem of unemployment, the Government endeavoured to help the workers and to ensure the payment of their entitlements and compensation. Consequently, the Government asked that the complaint be rejected.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899882, response status: 200"

The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August 1976 had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acu帽a Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acu帽o Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899834, response status: 200"

In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article 2 of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation.

Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Z煤帽iga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July 1976 at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order.

As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October 1976 that he was discharged on 1 March 1976 by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May 1978 state that he was dismissed in February 1976 by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899834, response status: 200"

According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Z煤帽iga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some 600 workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899834, response status: 200"

These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work 11 times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal.

In this very case, the Committee has pointed out that such a guarantee is also necessary in the case of trade union officials in order to give effect to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee has nevertheless stated that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances.

The Committee wishes to point out that in the public sector an effective means of helping to prevent such situations may be to put into practice measures inspired by the principles of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151), not only as concerns the protection of public employees against anti-union discrimination (Article 4 of the Convention) but also as regards the determination, through negotiation or other methods as provided for in the Convention, of the nature and scope of the facilities to be afforded, without prejudice to the efficient operation of the service concerned, to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations (Articles 6 and 7).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899834, response status: 200"

According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acu帽a Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on 17 June 1975 from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acu帽a Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristi谩n Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on 24 February 1977, after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899835, response status: 200"

It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acu帽a Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment.

In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acu帽a Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed.

However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on 24 February 1977 and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899835, response status: 200"

The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section 15 of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. 98, by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899836, response status: 200"

The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido N煤帽ez Rom谩n, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.,"Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE's attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido N煤帽ez Rom谩n, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article 334 of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce 1,100 members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker's letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section 61 of the Constitution and Sections 364, 366, 368 and 369 of the Labour Code. Section 368 specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section 369 defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

Consequently, it is the Government's opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article 370 of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

The Government included a large mass of documentation with its comments, including in particular a copy of the report on the investigations carried out by the labour inspectorate on the allegations of trade union persecution. According to this document, the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was endeavouring to restore peace amongst the personnel of the Institute at a time when the other union, the ASDEICE, was preparing a strike in sympathy with the SITET strikers who had been dismissed. Twenty-five of the workers questioned had stated to the investigator that they had left the SITET without any pressure from the group. The investigators stated that they had found no proof that members of the group had drafted some of the resignation letters referred to; most of them had been written by the heads of the offices at the various workplaces, in all cases at the request of the workers concerned. The Government attaches to its letter the text of statements obtained from the workers questioned. The reasons given for the resignations included in particular disagreement with the decision to strike and the need to use the union contribution money for other purposes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

In some cases the worker informed the union of his decision in writing; the worker sometimes asked the employer to cease deducting union dues from his pay because he was leaving the union; there were also cases in which workers sent a collective notice of resignation to the employer in the same way; in the majority of cases, the personnel department had received from the workers concerned a copy of the letter of resignation sent to the union and in such cases the employer had not checked whether the union had in fact received the original. The report in question concludes that the procedure followed by IOE to strike the names of resigning workers from the list it had prepared for check-off purposes is an internal matter, since, when notified of the resignations by one of the means mentioned, the personnel department instructs the accounts department to cease the deduction of union dues from the pay of the former union member.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

The strike was illegal since IOE is classified as a public service in which all strikes are forbidden (sections 368 and 369 of the Labour Code). According to the employer, the dismissal of eight strikers was due not to their participation in the strike action, but to committed actions harmful to the undertaking and punishable under law. The Committee nevertheless notes that an investigation carried out by the Ministry of Labour disclosed that seven of the eight dismissed workers had not committed any punishable offence. The decision to dismiss them was nevertheless maintained.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

In the case under discussion the strike had been started after the breakdown of negotiations. However, if, as claimed by SITET, arbitration could be refused by the IOE in application of a special provision, the workers of that Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests, which is contrary to the principle mentioned above.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

However, the Committee considers it somewhat strange that in many cases union members wishing to leave the union communicated firstly and sometimes only with the employer, that union members submitted collective resignations and that resignation letters were often written by the chiefs of offices at the request of the workers concerned. It considers that if the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was encouraged by the management to induce workers to leave the union, that would constitute an infringement of freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899718, response status: 200"

The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido N煤帽ez Rom谩n, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.,"Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE's attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido N煤帽ez Rom谩n, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article 334 of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce 1,100 members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker's letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section 61 of the Constitution and Sections 364, 366, 368 and 369 of the Labour Code. Section 368 specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section 369 defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

Consequently, it is the Government's opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article 370 of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

The Government included a large mass of documentation with its comments, including in particular a copy of the report on the investigations carried out by the labour inspectorate on the allegations of trade union persecution. According to this document, the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was endeavouring to restore peace amongst the personnel of the Institute at a time when the other union, the ASDEICE, was preparing a strike in sympathy with the SITET strikers who had been dismissed. Twenty-five of the workers questioned had stated to the investigator that they had left the SITET without any pressure from the group. The investigators stated that they had found no proof that members of the group had drafted some of the resignation letters referred to; most of them had been written by the heads of the offices at the various workplaces, in all cases at the request of the workers concerned. The Government attaches to its letter the text of statements obtained from the workers questioned. The reasons given for the resignations included in particular disagreement with the decision to strike and the need to use the union contribution money for other purposes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

In some cases the worker informed the union of his decision in writing; the worker sometimes asked the employer to cease deducting union dues from his pay because he was leaving the union; there were also cases in which workers sent a collective notice of resignation to the employer in the same way; in the majority of cases, the personnel department had received from the workers concerned a copy of the letter of resignation sent to the union and in such cases the employer had not checked whether the union had in fact received the original. The report in question concludes that the procedure followed by IOE to strike the names of resigning workers from the list it had prepared for check-off purposes is an internal matter, since, when notified of the resignations by one of the means mentioned, the personnel department instructs the accounts department to cease the deduction of union dues from the pay of the former union member.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

The strike was illegal since IOE is classified as a public service in which all strikes are forbidden (sections 368 and 369 of the Labour Code).

In the case under discussion the strike had been started after the breakdown of negotiations. However, if, as claimed by SITET, arbitration could be refused by the IOE in application of a special provision, the workers of that Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests, which is contrary to the principle mentioned above.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

However, the Committee considers it somewhat strange that in many cases union members wishing to leave the union communicated firstly and sometimes only with the employer, that union members submitted collective resignations and that resignation letters were often written by the chiefs of offices at the request of the workers concerned. It considers that if the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was encouraged by the management to induce workers to leave the union, that would constitute an infringement of freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899629, response status: 200"

Mr. Rodriguez began trade union activities in 1969 when he was a Class 2 Public Administration Officer in the Personnel Selection Branch of the Public Service Commission and he was responsible in large part for the founding in 1971 of the UNESECI.

It had drawn the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article 11 of Convention No. 87 according to which the countries (of which Costa Rica is one) having ratified this Convention undertake to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers - including public servants - may exercise freely the right to organise. The Committee had also stressed that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899540, response status: 200"

In July 1971, Mr. Brautigam proposed transferring Mr. Rodriguez to the Transport Ministry and in spite of petitions by the UNESECI and certain members of the Legislative Assembly explaining that such a transfer would leave the union leaderless, Mr. Rodriguez was sent to the Transport Ministry on 4 October 1971, to a job involving personnel classification which was not his special field.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899539, response status: 200"

Nevertheless, in April 1972 the UNDECA filed a series of claims in which it demanded various financial improvements. Notwithstanding the undertaking that had been given, the Executive Board of the Fund agreed to examine this list of claims, although it requested a longer time limit for the negotiations than the twenty-two days demanded by the union. At the beginning of May, while the negotiations were in progress, the union threatened to launch a series of strikes, which it in fact did on 12 May 1972.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899514, response status: 200"

Nevertheless, in June the union launched a further strike, which was likewise ruled to be illegal by the labour tribunal. On this second occasion the union went so far as to besiege the head office of the Fund and some of its hospital centres, endangering the health and even the lives of the patients. In consequence, the Fund was compelled to dismiss some of the workers and union leaders, since they had defaulted in their duties as employees in the hospital centres. It was this situation which prompted the request for the intervention of the police in order to safeguard order and the interests of the patients. The strike was ended and talks were resumed, but the union has already announced yet another stoppage.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899514, response status: 200"

As concerns the right to strike in essential services or in the civil service, the Committee has pointed out that, where strikes are forbidden or subject to restriction in such sectors, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard to the full the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests. The Committee has also pointed out that the restriction or prohibition in question should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. The Committee has also expressed the view that legislation which provides for compulsory conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899514, response status: 200"

The purpose of the law is that the appointments should be made on the basis of the degree of representativity of the Confederations concerned.

By such a procedure it would appear that the Council is under no obligation to nominate an equal number of members from each of the Confederations, and, according to the complainants, only one member proposed by them was nominated by the Council. The Committee further notes the Government's explanation that the purpose of the Act is that the members of the executive body of the Bank should be selected by the Council on the basis of the degree of representativity of each of the Confederations concerned, and that the complainant organisation was not the one having the largest membership.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899467, response status: 200"

The Homoeopathy Workers' Union, founded in 1969, was duly registered by the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour after the provisions of its statutes relating to the organisation's funds had been amended in compliance with a request made by the office in question. The Union appears to have functioned normally until April 1971, when it was informed by the Ministry that, on the basis of information furnished by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Ministry had made application to the courts for the Union's judicial dissolution. The information supplied by the College of Physicians and Surgeons was to the effect that up to 1970 only three persons had been authorised by the College to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica. Under the law of that country the practice of homoeopathy and certain other special branches of medicine is subject to such authorisation being granted.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899414, response status: 200"

The Committee observed that in Costa Rica the medical profession is governed by laws and regulations of this kind, and that it was these provisions and the law governing the establishment of trade unions which the Government had invoked as justification for its application to the courts for the dissolution of a union consisting, apparently, of three properly qualified and duly authorised homoeopaths and a number of other persons who had not received proper authorisation to practise this branch of medicine.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899414, response status: 200"

In addition, the Government draws attention to the legal provisions of the Health Code of 1949, which makes it illegal for unauthorised persons to practise certain paramedical occupations (including homoeopathy). Under the Penal Code, the unlawful practice of medicine and related occupations is a criminal offence.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899415, response status: 200"

The union appears to have functioned normally as such until April 1971, when it was informed by the Ministry that, information having been received from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, an application had been made to the Court for its dissolution. The information supplied by the College was that up to 1970 only three persons in Costa Rica had been authorised by the College to practise homoeopathy.

Such rules are, of necessity, stringent in order to ensure that the general public may have adequate protection against persons who may seek to exercise professional activities without the qualifications or authorisation by the supervisory professional body which may be necessary before doing so. The Committee has observed that, in Costa Rica, the medical profession is governed by laws and regulations of this kind, and it is these regulations and the law governing the establishment of trade unions which the Government invokes as justification for the application to the courts for the dissolution of a union consisting, apparently, of three properly qualified and duly authorised homoeopaths and a number of other persons who have not received proper authorisation to practise this branch of medicine. The Government argues that the union is not a union constituted by at least 20 persons exercising their profession independently, as required under section 273 of the Labour Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899415, response status: 200"

It would therefore seem that these persons are engaged in work connected with, or ancillary to, the practice of homoeopathy and that it is not considered that special authorisation is essential for this type of work. The Committee considers that such persons, provided they are legally performing activities in connection with the profession of homoeopathy, should be entitled to the protection afforded by the freedom of association Conventions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899415, response status: 200"

According to the information supplied by the Government, this provision would appear to be interpreted in such a manner as to place a restriction on the forming of an occupational organisation consisting both of independent professionals and of employees (trabajadores) as defined in section 4 of the Labour Code, despite the fact that they all exercise functions in the same occupational sphere. Such a restriction would, in the opinion of the Committee, constitute an infringement of Article 2 of Convention No. 87, which guarantees to workers, without distinction whatsoever, the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899415, response status: 200"

Mr. Gamboa spoke to them, but did not ask them why they were there. At a later meeting at which the Minister of Public Security, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Mr. Gamboa and the two policemen concerned were present, the latter declared that while on their beat during the Christmas festivities they passed in front of the union offices in question and were invited by a man who came out to join the party. They stayed for a few minutes and had a short conversation with Mr. Gamboa, and then left without in any way - disturbing the guests at the party. According to the Government Mr. Gamboa did not deny this account, but argued that he had lodged his complaint with a number of international trade union organisations because of the potential threat to trade union freedoms involved in actions such as these, which might create a precedent.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898755, response status: 200"

The meeting he attended was alleged to be communist-inspired, and the commandant requested Mr. Gamboa to accompany him to his office.

In Case No. 66, concerning Greece, the Committee expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. On that occasion the Committee considered that in this respect it should be guided by the conclusions approved by the Governing Body in 1937 and 1938 with regard to two representations submitted by the Madras Labour Union for Textile Workers and by the Soci茅t茅 de Bienfaisance des Travailleurs de l'Ile Maurice, in accordance with article 23 of the Constitution of the Organisation (now article 24). The Governing Body at that time established the principle that, from the moment that a representation was submitted to it, it alone was competent to decide what effect should be given to it, and that "" the withdrawal by the organisation making the representation is not always proof that the representation is not receivable or is not well founded"". The Committee considers that, in implementing this principle, it is free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence. It has been pointed out by the Committee that cases might exist in which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it would be a result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898755, response status: 200"

",['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898755'],"70.In the present case it would appear from the information supplied by the Government, taken in conjunction with that contained in the complainants' communication of 6 February 1964, that the problems raised have been adequately taken care of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare having given an explanation of what had occurred and issued instructions to local authorities to ensure respect for the principle of freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898755, response status: 200"

However, the Committee considered that it would be difficult to determine in advance whether an organisation applying for registration would or would not engage in activities foreign to trade union activities. As the Committee emphasised in its general conclusions in 1957, normal control of the activities of trade unions should be effected a posteriori and by the judicial authorities; and the fact that an organisation which seeks to enjoy the status of an occupational organisation might in certain cases engage in activities foreign to trade union activities does not appear to constitute sufficient reason for subjecting trade union organisations a priori to control with respect to their composition and with respect to the composition of their management committees.""","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898462, response status: 200"

In accordance with the Labour Code of Costa Rica the Superior Labour Court recognised the lawfulness of their action.,"Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

The Minister of Labour stated, it is alleged, that the Government would negotiate only with the leaders of FETRABA, ignoring the leaders of F.O.B.A in the action undertaken by these two organisations. Thus, states the complainant, the Government has shown itself to be the worst enemy of the unity of the working class and nothing more than a servile instrument of the Company.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

It states that a pact of unity between F.O.B.A and FETRABA was the only means available to the worker of starting a collective dispute in the banana industry in accordance with the requirements of the laws. The dispute followed the procedure prescribed by law ; recourse was had to conciliation proceedings and then the workers' representatives secured from the labour courts a ruling that their strike was legal. It was then that the Government decided to intervene on its own initiative circumventing the statutory procedure-to prevent the strike from spreading. The complaining organisation was not averse to government intervention because it desired to reach a settlement by negotiation. But, the complainant declares, the intervention was not limited to an attempt to mediate, being intended to break the united front of the workers by a move against the agreement which was needed to make the strike legal. In this connection the complainant states that, while it is true under Costa Rican law that trade union organisations as such have no place in a dispute, it is also true that the Minister did not address himself directly either to the workers or to their legal representatives, but to one only of the federations concerned-FETRABA-to the exclusion of the other. While intervention by the administrative authorities is not provided for under the law, the complainant admits the right of the Minister to approach one of the organisations concerned for the purpose of negotiating ; in the present case, however, it is alleged that the choice made was discriminatory because it did not take account of the fact that F.O.B.A is the majority and, therefore, the more representative organisation. The pact of unity between the two organisations concerned was attacked and it was stated publicly-without, it is alleged, the Minister of Labour denying it-that the Minister refused to deal with the F.O.B.A on the ground that it was Communist. In fact, the Minister dealt only with FETRABA. It is contended that the Minister of Labour, in statements to the press, attacked F.O.B.A and its leaders and spoke only against the inter-union pact. On 23 August 1955, declares the complainant, the Minister stated that he had decided "" to prevent persons to whom the workers' fate is of no consequence -and by that I mean the Communists-from trying to add grist to their mill simply to promote the class struggle and to maintain a state of constant unrest in the banana plantations "". It is alleged that the President of the Republic directly attacked the pact in an interview, stating : "" The recent amalgamation of the F.O.B.A unions (directed by the Communists) and the FETRABA unions (non-Communist) was not exactly a happy manoeuvre for the democratic workers, because I feel convinced that they can greatly improve their working conditions without having to resort to communism. We always foster the growth of strong and democratic workers' movements when they are not tainted with communism.""","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

In support of this the Government refers to article 262 of the Labour Code, which provides that "" the lawful Constitution of social organisations, whether industrial associations or co-operative societies, is hereby declared to be in the public interest as one of the most efficacious means of contributing to the maintenance and development of popular culture and democracy in Costa Rica "", adding that the present Government has faithfully respected this principle by recognising without restriction the right of the workers to form trade unions. The Government states that all trade unions have the right to take action in matters relating to the study, improvement and protection of the economic and social interests of their members, and that no person or trade union organisation has been discriminated against with respect to the recognition of these rights. The Government claims that it has shown tolerance in this respect even at times when the safety of the nation has been in danger. Although the Constitution of Costa Rica prohibits the formation of political parties-such as the Communist Party which seek to undermine the foundations of the country's democratic r茅gime, the Government has allowed former adherents of the Communist Party to work in the trade unions. Despite the links between the Communist Party and such persons, the Government has refrained from interfering in the affairs of the trade unions to which they belong. According to the Government, the person behind the present complaint is one of these persons.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

The law states that for a collective dispute to arise the workers concerned have to form an ad hoc association representing at least 60 per cent of all the persons employed in the undertaking. The dispute must be submitted to the employer with a view to an amicable settlement ; if such settlement proves impossible it is submitted to a tripartite conciliation board, whose recommendations are not binding on the parties. If no agreement can be reached the workers may apply to a court of law to authorise them to call a strike. If this authorisation is given the strike is legal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

However, in the present case, in order to avoid the harm resulting from a strike, the Government saw fit to intervene on its own initiative with the workers and with the company without considering-contrary to the complainant's statement-their membership or non-membership of one organisation or another. The intervention of the Ministry of Labour was made in all good faith without preference being given to any particular trade union. The Ministry consulted different persons, regardless of their trade union affiliations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

It also points out that in Costa Rica the right to declare a strike is not a trade union right but a right of workers in general. When the Government proposes to mediate a dispute it does not have to choose between trade union leaders ; it is sufficient to deal with workers inspired by sound democratic doctrine who enjoy the confidence of their comrades. The statements by the President of the Republic and the Minister of Labour mentioned by the complainant are substantially correct and were justified because the intervention in the dispute of Communist leaders and agitators was a secret to nobody. The Government did not discriminate between trade unions but with respect to ideological groups tainted with communism. When the Government takes measures against the members of such groups it cares little for their trade union affiliation. The Government, however, cannot support any form of trade unionism other than democratic trade unionism free from any separatist influence.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

The complainant does not object to the Government intervening to mediate, even though it exercised its initiative in a manner not exactly corresponding to law, but objects to the alleged discrimination by the Government between the two organisations and to the making of public statements by leading members of the Government which, it is alleged, caused FETRABA to denounce its pact of unity with F.O.B.A. The Government declares that, while it encourages only the democratic trade unions, it has respected the right of workers of all tendencies to organise. Under the Labour Code of Costa Rica, however, no trade union organisation as such is a participant in disputes-a fact admitted by the complainant-because the dispute procedure laid down requires the formation of an ad hoc organisation representing at least 60 per cent of the workers in the undertaking, and a strike can be lawful only when this procedure has been followed. The Government admits that it intervened to mediate, although no provision for mediation by the administrative authorities is made in the law, and states that it hoped in this way to avoid the effects of a strike which would have been disastrous. In its first reply the Government states that it approached the leaders of the workers irrespective of their trade union affiliation. In its second reply, while adhering to the statement that it did not discriminate between trade union organisations but between leaders of the workers of different ideologies, the Government admits that, among other things, the President did state that the inter-union agreement was not a happy manoeuvre, as it linked F.O.B.A, which he called Communist, with FETRABA, which he called non-Communist. The Government denies that the measures it took had anything to do with the breaking of the pact of unity between the two federations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

In several earlier cases the Committee has been called upon to give a decision with regard to the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, might nevertheless affect the exercise of such rights. In the present case, while the Government contends that the action which it took involved no discrimination between trade unions, the Committee considers that it has before it precise allegations to the effect that, directly or indirectly, the action of the Government resulted in the leaders of a smaller organisation being consulted to the exclusion of the leaders of a larger one in a matter which was clearly of an occupational nature, and that it should, therefore, examine the substance of the allegations made.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

Because of this, and because under the law trade unions are not parties to disputes, the Government argues that any discrimination between the persons with whom it chose to deal made on ideological grounds did not constitute a discrimination between trade unions. As it admits that its ideological considerations led it to regard it as sufficient to deal only with those leaders of the workers whom it considered to be "" inspired by sound democratic doctrine "" and stands by a public statement of the President that F.O.B.A is Communist and FETRABA non-Communist and that their fusion was an unhappy manoeuvre, it appears to the Committee that the natural consequence of this was that the leaders of the workers consulted by the Government in the mediation proceedings must of necessity have been leaders of FETRABA rather than of F.O.B.A.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

Where a body representing the workers in a dispute is elected by those workers, the Committee considers that the right to elect their representatives in full freedom is restricted if some only of those representatives, on the basis of their political opinions, are chosen by a government as persons with whom it will deal in an effort to mediate in the dispute. Where the law of the land provides that the Government may address itself to those who appear to be the representatives of the workers of an undertaking and, in effect, to choose those with whom it will deal, any selection on such a political basis as to eliminate from those dealings, even indirectly, the leaders of the organisation most representative of the class of workers concerned would appear to result in the law of the land being so applied as to impair the right of the workers to choose their own representatives.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898185, response status: 200"

The proposed enactment, the text of which is attached to the complaint, would in particular amend the Labour Code by forbidding persons who have been members of or sympathisers with any of the political parties prohibited by the Constitution or by Parliament to act as trade union officers. In addition, the Minister of Labour would have power to dissolve trade unions which did not comply with this provision. Persons who had been members of or sympathisers with the Communist Party could not join or represent a trade union. The fact that it had more than two members who were Communist sympathisers would justify the dissolution of a union, and the fact that it had not complied with a provision in the proposed enactment would render it liable to fairly serious penalties.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898160, response status: 200"

In these circumstances, while emphasising again the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers should have the right to join organisations of their own choosing and that their organisations should not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority, but noting the assurance given by the Government that the Bill in question in the present case is not a Government proposal, the Committee, without prejudging any examination as to the merits which it might be called upon to make as the result of a further complaint being presented in the event of the Bill being adopted, considers that it would be premature for it to take any action on the present complaint.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898160, response status: 200"
