The trade union alleges in particular that: (i) on 8 November 2021, it submitted an application for registration to the Ministry of Labour in order to safeguard the rights of the 100,000-plus digital platform workers in the country who are not recognized as employees and who are subjected to highly precarious working conditions; (ii) by Official Letter No. MDT-DOL-2021-1817-O, the Ministry of Labour stated that the intention of the applicants is to establish a primary-level trade union of digital platform workers in Ecuador who do not have an employment relationship with the same employer, and therefore the application in question falls outside the scope of the Labour Code; (iii) in the aforementioned official letter, the Ministry of Labour referred to a ruling of 25 May 2021 (Case No. 17981-2020-02407) concerning the application for the registration of the Trade Union Association of Rural Banana Workers (ASTAC), in which the Criminal Chamber of the Pichincha Provincial Court instructed the Ministry of Labour to regulate the exercise of the right to freedom of association by branch of activity and to refrain from restricting or limiting the rights relating to freedom of association of other organizations applying for registration by branch of activity, under the same conditions and circumstances as those examined in this case; (iv) the official letter further stated that the Ministry of Labour has filed an appeal against this ruling and a recommendation was therefore made to FRENAPP to reapply once the appeal has been resolved; (v) noting that, by Ministerial Agreement No. MDT-2022-001 of 11 January 2022, the Ministry of Labour agreed to endorse and register the statutes of and grant legal status to ASTAC, on 9 May 2022 FRENAPP submitted in writing to the Ministry of Labour another request to register it as a trade union and to grant it legal status immediately, drawing attention to the aforementioned ruling of 25 May 2021; (vi)聽by Official Letter No. MDT-DOL-2022-0735-O of 23聽August 2022, the Ministry of Labour reiterated its previous reply, again inviting FRENAPP to resubmit its request once the appeal filed by the Ministry of Labour against the ruling of 25 May 2021 has been resolved; and (vii) on 28 July 2022, an action for non-compliance was brought before the Constitutional Court of Ecuador against the Ministry of Labour, under Case No. 147-22-IS, which is under evaluation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421, response status: 200"

The Government adds that section 459 of the Labour Code, which was amended by a 2018 decision of the Constitutional Court (Decision No. 2 of the Constitutional Court, published in the Official Journal, Supplement 40, of 6 April 2018), provides for the possible establishment of workers' associations by branch of activity, provided that the workers work in the same enterprise and not in different enterprises, since an employer鈥揺mployee relationship is a precondition for the right to freedom of association. In the light of the foregoing, the Government states that the non-registration of FRENAPP is not contrary to freedom of association, which is safeguarded both by the Constitution of Ecuador and by Convention No. 87.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421, response status: 200"

In particular, the Government reiterates that: (i) in accordance with section 97 of the Organic General Procedural Code, the ruling of 25 May 2021 concerning the registration of the ASTAC banana workers鈥?union has binding effect only for the parties that instituted the proceedings; (ii) the part of the said ruling instructing the Ministry of Labour to regulate the exercise of the right to freedom of association by branch of activity would contravene the Constitution and the Ecuadorian legal system whose legislation restricts the registration of organizations of workers who do not belong to the same enterprise or share the same employer; and (iii) the said ruling is still under review by the Constitutional Court of Ecuador.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that the complainant organization specifically alleges that: (i) the Ministry of Labour, by its decisions of 28 December 2021 and 23 August 2022, refused the registration of FRENAPP on the grounds that it is seeking to bring together workers from several enterprises; (ii) the refusal of the registration of FRENAPP is contrary to the ruling of 25 May 2021 of the Pichincha Provincial Court relating to the application for the registration of another trade union, the banana workers' association ASTAC, which instructed the Ministry of Labour to regulate the exercise of the right to freedom of association by branch of activity and to refrain from restricting or limiting the rights relating to freedom of association of other organizations applying for registration by branch of activity; (iii) the Ministry of Labour invited FRENAPP to resubmit its application for registration once the Constitutional Court has handed down a decision on the ASTAC case; and (iv) in view of the above, FRENAPP brought an action for non-compliance before the Constitutional Court against the Ministry of Labour. The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) the national legislation, in particular the Labour Code, does not provide for the possibility of establishing trade unions composed of workers from several enterprises, since the existence of an employer鈥揺mployee relationship is a precondition for freedom of association; and (ii) in accordance with the Organic General Procedure Code, the ruling of the Pichincha Provincial Court in the ASTAC case is limited in effect to the parties to the dispute in question and is the subject of an appeal before the Constitutional Court.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421, response status: 200"
Case No 3437 (Ecuador),17-Oct-22,the Ecuadorian Digital Platforms Workers' Front (FRENAPP),['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421'],"358.The Committee observes that it is clear from the foregoing that the present case concerns the refusal of the registration of a trade union whose objective is to bring together workers from the different digital platforms that exist in the country. The Committee notes that both the complainant organization and the Government agree that the refusal by the Ministry of Labour of the registration of FRENAPP was based on the fact that the latter is seeking to bring together workers from different enterprises. The Committee recalls that Case No. 3148, which has given rise to two interim reports of the Committee [see 381st Report, March 2017, paras 420鈥?42, and 391st Report, October 2019, paras 225鈥?52], concerns the same issue, which in that case relates to the registration of ASTAC, a trade union in the country鈥檚 banana sector whose situation has been mentioned by both the complainant organization and the Government in the present case. The Committee recalls that, in the context of Case No. 3148, it requested the Government to: (i) take the necessary measures to ensure that national legislation complies with the principles of freedom of association concerning the minimum membership required to establish a trade union at the enterprise level and the possibility of setting up primary-level trade unions comprising workers from various companies; and (ii)聽to take the necessary measures to enable the registration of ASTAC without delay. The Committee also recalls that it referred the legislative aspects of that case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) [see Case No. 3148, 381st Report, March聽2017, paragraph 442].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421, response status: 200"
Case No 3437 (Ecuador),17-Oct-22,the Ecuadorian Digital Platforms Workers' Front (FRENAPP),['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421'],"359.The Committee notes with regret that, despite its recommendations in the context of Case No. 3148 and the follow-up by the CEACR of the legislative aspects of the case, neither the country's legislation nor the practices of the Ministry of Labour yet allow for the establishment of primary-level trade unions composed of workers from different enterprises. The Committee recalls that this constraint is particularly detrimental to the exercise of freedom of association in view of the Labour Code of Ecuador, which requires a minimum number of 30 workers to establish a trade union (sections 443 and 452). The Committee once again recalls that the free exercise of the right to establish and join unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of unions and that workers should be free to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organization, such as an industrial or craft union [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, paras 502 and 504]. With respect to the statement by the Government that the existence of an employer鈥揺mployee relationship would be a precondition for freedom of association, the Committee recalls that it has considered that, by virtue of the principles of freedom of association, all workers 鈥?with the sole exception of members of the armed forces and the police 鈥?should have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. The criterion for determining the persons covered by that right, therefore, is not based on the existence of an employment relationship, which is often non-existent, for example in the case of agricultural workers, self-employed workers in general or those who practise liberal professions, who should nevertheless enjoy the right to organize [see Compilation, para. 387].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4364421, response status: 200"

In this respect, the Committee recalls that the principle that both employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith and make efforts to reach an agreement means that any unjustified delay in the holding of negotiations should be avoided [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, para. 1330].

The Committee has also considered that insofar as the income of public enterprises and bodies depends on state budgets, it would not be objectionable 鈥?after wide discussion and consultation between the concerned employers鈥?and employees鈥?organizations in a system having the confidence of the parties 鈥?for wage ceilings to be fixed in state budgetary laws, and neither would it be a matter for criticism that the Ministry of Finance prepare a report prior to the commencement of collective bargaining with a view to ensuring respect of such ceilings [see Compilation, paras 1486 and 1491]. Based on the foregoing, and with a view to strengthening the parties鈥?confidence in collective bargaining mechanisms and reaching a reasonable compromise between the need to preserve the autonomy of the bargaining parties and the duty incumbent on governments to ensure the balance of public accounts, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures, including legislative measures if needed, to ensure that the reports or opinions of the budgetary authorities are issued prior to the conclusion of an agreement between the parties.

The Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege in particular that: (i) there is interference by the Government in the criminal proceedings against Mr Tatamuez Moreno; and (ii) the aim of such interference is to stop trade union leaders from fighting against labour reform policies in the country. The Committee notes that the Government, for its part, indicates that, under the constitutional rule of law, the branches of government are duly separated and independent, and that there has been no interference on its part in the criminal investigation by the Prosecutor-General鈥檚 Office into the events that took place in the context of the social protests of October 2019. It also notes that the Government maintains that giving a statement before a duly appointed prosecutor does not mean that a person is under suspicion or being prosecuted, and that there has been no action that has violated Mr Tatamuez Moreno鈥檚 rights because of his status as a trade union leader. The Committee takes due note of these points. The Committee notes that the above-mentioned criminal complaint relates to Mr Tatamuez Moreno鈥檚 participation in a demonstration in the context of the October 2019 protests. Observing that no details have been provided of the specific facts that gave rise to the complaint, the Committee recalls that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising protest action and that, while persons engaged in trade union activities or holding trade union office cannot claim immunity in respect of the ordinary criminal law, the arrest of, and criminal charges brought against, trade unionists may only be based on legal requirements that in themselves do not infringe the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, paras 224 and 133]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation into the criminal complaint brought against Mr聽Tatamuez Moreno and trusts that, in the context of the examination of that complaint, the competent authorities will take full account of the above-mentioned decisions on freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4120995, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) the Ministry of Labour held working groups, including with the complainant organizations, and publicized the proposals through the media; (ii) the proposed reforms were not submitted to the National Assembly; and (iii) the Committee does not have sufficient grounds to comment on proposed reforms, which do not have legal force, and in respect of which the complainant organizations have not submitted precise and detailed allegations, but rather arguments that do not reflect the reality of the labour reforms led by the Ministry of Labour.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4120995, response status: 200"

The complainants allege, specifically, that: (i) on 24 January 2019, the Communications Director of the National Customs Service of Ecuador (鈥渢he public institution鈥? sent a memorandum regarding two posts published in January 2019 by Mr聽Bastidas Ord贸帽ez on ASPAE鈥檚 social media page in which, on the one hand, he deplores the fact that the director of the public institution relies more on the national police than on her own service鈥檚 employees and that, on the other hand, the institution鈥檚 equipment and staffing levels are inadequate; (ii) the memorandum considers that the two posts constitute gross misconduct, flouting the public institution鈥檚 communications guidelines and code of ethics, as well as section 289 of the code for agencies responsible for public safety and public order (COESCOP), which include provisions for gross misconduct committed by the public officials of those agencies; (iii) on 7 April 2019, following a series of procedural steps, the public institution鈥檚 disciplinary board imposed a financial penalty on Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez equivalent to 8 per cent of his monthly salary; and (iv) the administrative appeal lodged by Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez was subsequently rejected.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081875, response status: 200"

With respect to the truthfulness of the statements made by Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez, the complainants maintain that, during the disciplinary proceedings, the defence asked for reports to be provided demonstrating that the various statements made by Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez on the institution鈥檚 inadequate equipment and staffing levels were unfounded, but that this request was rejected. With regard to the possible damage caused by the posts published by the trade union official, the complainants state that an administrative ruling included in the administrative inquiry asking the Directorate of Communications to indicate the damage caused had gone unheeded and that there is no information in the administrative file on the damage caused. The complainants also maintain that the communications in question cannot be considered to be contravening the institution鈥檚 communications guidelines because they apply to public servants while carrying out their employment duties, whereas Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez published his posts while carrying out his responsibilities as a trade union official.

The complainants refer, first, to administrative inquiry No. SENAE-CVA-006-2019, based on the statements that Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez gave to the broadcasting and media production company, Pichincha Universal, during the period of public protests that began in Ecuador in October 2019 in the wake of the economic measures adopted by the Government. Memorandum No.聽SENAE DNV 2019 2207 M dated 14 October 2019 states that Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez 鈥渁llegedly issued statements that were devoid of technical basis regarding the quality of the institution鈥檚 public servants and measures announced by the National Government鈥? acts that could constitute misconduct under section 289(11) and (22) and section 290(11) of the COESCOP. The complainants refer, second, to administrative inquiry No.聽SENAE CVA 007 2019, based on a letter dated 24 September 2019 sent by CONASEP to the President of the Republic in which numerous acts of violence against the institution鈥檚 public servants are detailed and which includes a request for a hearing to discuss the facts. The complainants state that, once again, the employer considered this letter to be contrary to the above-mentioned provisions of the COESCOP because the statements were without technical basis. The complainants emphasize that, while section 289 of the aforementioned COESCOP provides for gross misconduct, section聽290(11) defines as very serious misconduct the issuance of reports or technical criteria that are unfounded, biased or malicious or contain technically proven fundamental errors.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081875, response status: 200"

The complainants add that, as in the initial administrative inquiries that led to the opening of the complaint file, the fundamental rules of domestic and international law regarding freedom of information and expression and freedom of association are not being taken into consideration in the ongoing disciplinary proceedings. The complainants maintain that taking these rules into account is of special importance now, given that the accumulation of administrative inquiries and sanctions against Mr聽Bastidas Ord贸帽ez will directly result in his dismissal as a public official.

(iii) one of these statements was also linked to the personal web page of Mr聽Bastidas Ord贸帽ez; (iv) it was verified during the disciplinary proceedings that Mr聽Bastidas Ord贸帽ez was indeed the author of the posts and the administrator of the web pages in question; (v) in his defence, Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez merely stated that it was the obligation of the party initiating the proceedings to establish the facts contained in the complaint, thereby challenging the facts and legal basis for the disciplinary proceedings and claiming his right to legal certainty; and (vi) among the rules violated by the public official are the public institution鈥檚 guidelines, which provide that an official spokesperson of the institution should not give a personal opinion, but transmit the institution鈥檚 position through messages previously decided by the Directorate of Communications, and that official spokespersons are members of general management and that assistant managers, while being district spokespersons, can only act with the prior authorization of the Directorate of Communications.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081875, response status: 200"

Furthermore, regarding the complainants鈥?allegation that Mr Bastidas Ord贸帽ez is at risk of imminent dismissal, the Government asserts that this allegation is untrue, since the public servant in question is still in active service and the reasons for dismissal of any customs official from the customs inspection corps are explicitly established in section 240 of the COESCOP.

The Government adds that: (i) the LOSEP provides for a number of ways to definitively terminate the employment of civil servants, including the abolition of posts with compensation and the purchase of redundancy with compensation; (ii) while in both cases the terminations must be duly justified in the respective technical and legal reports, the abolition of posts and the purchase of redundancy with compensation are two different arrangements with different purposes, and each arrangement is therefore subject to specific requirements; (iii) in the present case, the abolition of posts with compensation was the arrangement used; (iv) in full compliance with section 60 of the LOSEP and with the Constitution of Ecuador, the abolitions were supported by technical reports and preceded by a process carried out on technical, functional and economic grounds, based on the principles of rationalization, prioritization, optimization and functionality, and therefore there was no discrimination against the ANERCIC and its members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081869, response status: 200"

In light of the foregoing, the Committee regrets that it must once again emphasize that insofar as civil servants鈥?organizations are intended to promote the economic and social interests of their members, they are fully covered by the principles of freedom of association in general and protection against anti union discrimination in particular, regardless of their legal name or regulations under national legislation. Noting that the legislation applicable to the public sector reformed in 2017 provides special protection against dismissal that applies only to the leaders of the Civil Services Committees (a specific form of representation for public sector workers established by that legislation), the Committee trusts that the Government will take all necessary measures to ensure that the above-mentioned legislative provisions protect all leaders of public workers鈥?organizations against possible acts of anti-union discrimination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081869, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes the indication of the complainant organizations that all of the dismissed workers were ANERCIC members, including five members of its leadership, and their allegations that the dismissals were not preceded by consultation with the trade union or accompanied by an indication of the technical grounds upon which they were based. In light of the above, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the alleged anti-union nature of the dismissal of 36 members of the ANERCIC is investigated in the near future by an independent body. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed regarding this investigation and its outcomes. Furthermore, noting the Government鈥檚 statement that neither the public institution concerned nor the Ministry of Labour have received complaints about the dismissal process in question, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information on any administrative or judicial action taken in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081869, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee notes that, in its reply, the Government did not refer to contacts between the public institution and the civil servants鈥?organizations concerned before the abolition of the above-mentioned posts. Reiterating its recommendations regarding Case No. 2926 (see 370th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, paragraph 389), the Committee once again requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the civil servants鈥?organizations concerned are consulted on staff reduction plans with a view, inter alia, to preventing possible instances of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4081869, response status: 200"

The complainant also alleges that its leaders do not have union leave or collect union dues, an issue that was raised in Case No.聽2755, the recommendations from which the Government has not complied with. The complainant states that administrative proceedings have been brought against teachers and leaders, they have been dismissed, transferred or had their working hours reduced or increased excessively. They also state that Ms Mery Zamora, former president of the UNE, has been subjected to criminal persecution by the public authorities.

The Government states that, although the legislature sought to provide workers with indefinite job stability, with a view to adapting to the needs of each production sector the legislature had left it to the employer鈥檚 discretion to use other contractual arrangements such as temporary, casual or seasonal contracts (article 11 of the Labour Code). In addition, in accordance with article 23.1 of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour is empowered to allow special employment relationships not provided for under the Code, including in the agriculture sector. Consequently, in view of the high percentage of informality in the agricultural sector and the specific needs of the sector, which has specific periods for planting and harvesting that do not correspond to the statutory hours of work established in the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour decided to adapt to the economic, social and legal reality of the agriculture and banana sectors and to issue the aforementioned ministerial agreements.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017595, response status: 200"

However, the Government considers that the minimum pay set by the sectoral wage scale may be improved by agreement between the parties and emphasizes that the labour organizations are a key part of the continuous improvement of remuneration in Ecuador. Furthermore, the Government states that the ministerial agreements allow the possibility to maintain discontinuous stability for workers, analogous to the seasonal contract contemplated in the Labour Code in force, as the employer may call on its workers in each cycle or phase of productivity. Concerning specifically the purported restrictions on the right to freedom of association, the Government affirms that that right is protected under the Constitution. Lastly, the Government makes reference to an application filed by ASTAC on 22 August 2018 for constitutional review of the aforementioned agreements, and indicates that, on 2 May 2019, the Constitutional Court denied the application on the grounds that the applicant had failed to argue how the aforementioned ministerial agreements violated the Constitution and the international conventions ratified by Ecuador.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017595, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that ASTAC reports that, despite the Committee鈥檚 recommendations, the Ministry of Labour has still not met with the union, that the Ministry did recognize two branch-level unions (in the horticultural and domestic work sectors) and that certain matters of a political and social nature were impeding the establishment of the trade union organization. The Committee notes that, in turn, the Government reiterates that the application for the approval and registration of the articles of association of ASTAC was rejected because the 31聽founder members were not in a dependent employment relationship with only one employer and that the application for approval of status and granting of legal personality to recognize ASTAC as a social organization was rejected in 2016 because it was flawed in form and substance. The Government adds that: (i) on 9 February 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Farming granted legal personality to ASTAC as an agro-production organization; (ii) the Government has no record of ASTAC having filed administrative or legal appeals with a view to continuing the formal process for administrative recognition or a further application to establish a trade union organization; and (iii) denies that the Ministry of Labour declined to meet with ASTAC leaders and states that it even advised them on the recent legislative changes that affect the banana sector.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017595, response status: 200"

While pointing out once again that branch-level trade unions have been recognized in other sectors in the country, the Committee recalls that, in its previous examination of the case, it noted with concern that many agricultural workers in Ecuador not only find it impossible to set up company unions owing to the minimum membership requirement which is conflicting with the structure of a sector where most production units are small, but that they were also seeing their efforts to overcome that obstacle by grouping together in sectoral organizations being frustrated. The Committee observes that, on the one hand, ASTAC states that no representatives of its organization have managed to meet with the Ministry of Labour to discuss the union鈥檚 registration and the situation of workers in the banana sector in Ecuador, while, on the other hand, the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour did not decline to engage in dialogue with the representatives of that trade union organization and even provided it with advice. In addition, while noting the Government鈥檚 indication that ASTAC has not challenged the decision denying its registration, the Committee draws the Government鈥檚 attention to the fact that one of the main subject matters of this complaint concerns the registration of ASTAC and the fact that it is impossible under the law to form branch-level trade unions. Recalling that recognizing ASTAC as an agro production organization does not guarantee that its trade union rights are protected, the Committee once again requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that ASTAC is registered as a trade union organization if the organization submits a further request and to ensure that, in the meantime, the necessary guarantees and protections are provided to its members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017595, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that the Government indicates that a request to initiate an inquiry must be substantiated on the basis of a complaint from the applicant and that the Ministry of Labour indicates that it has no record of any complaints concerning actions directed against the founding of the company union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017595, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that the appendices provided by the complainant show that it filed two complaints, in 2010 and 2016, with the Office of the Ombudsperson; that the Office of the Ombudsperson conducted two site visits on the basis of a report from ASTAC members; and that on 8 November 2017, and 28聽March and 8聽November 2018, ASTAC filed reports with the Public Prosecutor鈥檚 Office in connection with anti-union dismissals, blacklisting, harassment and acts of retaliation. As to the alleged blacklisting, the Committee recalls that all practices involving the blacklisting of trade union officials or members constitute a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights and, in general, governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, 2018, para. 1121].","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017595, response status: 200"

While noting that the company states that the person who threatened Mr Luis Ochoa is not a representative of the company, the Committee notes with regret that the Government does not communicate any specific information in relation to Mr Luis Ochoa鈥檚 circumstances or the status of his criminal complaint, and recalls once again that the rights of workers鈥?and employers鈥?organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 84].

In this respect, the Government states that the system containing the proceedings of the Council of the Judiciary only shows the existence of an application for protection that had been filed, and that if the union leader wishes to request protection measures, he may make an application to the relevant bodies, which will duly attend to it. The Committee observes that, on 23聽February 2018, ASTAC filed a complaint with the Public Prosecutor鈥檚 Office concerning death threats against its general secretary (file number 090101818024320), and urges the Government to ensure that the complaint filed by the secretary general of ASTAC, Mr Jorge Washington Acosta Orellana, on 7 March 2018, is investigated, that the Government takes any action necessary to prevent any repetition of those acts in the future and to ensure his safety, and that it keeps the Committee informed in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:4017595, response status: 200"

In turn, the Government denies that the agreements contain any restrictions on freedom of association or collective bargaining, which are protected under the Constitution, given that in its view, the primary objective is to adapt the legislation in line with the realities and needs of the banana sector and to regulate labour relations in the sector. Furthermore, the Government states that the agreements have allowed employers the possibility to maintain a discontinuous stability for workers, as employers may call on their workers in each cycle or phase of productivity, and that ASTAC鈥檚 application for constitutional review was denied by the Constitutional Court. While recalling that it is not within the mandate of the Committee to assess the legislative and regulatory action of the Government to establish minimum employment and contractual conditions in a particular sector [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 34], the Committee recalls that, in certain circumstances, the renewal of fixed-term contracts for several years may affect the exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, op. cit., para. 1094]. In the absence of evidence to assess the impact of the issuance of the ministerial agreements on the exercise of freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively in the banana sector, the Committee invites the Government to examine, together with the organizations of employers and workers concerned, the impact of the reform on the exercise of freedom of association.

The Committee notes that the complainants allege that: (i) the refusal to register the trade union was a clear violation of the trade union rights recognized by Conventions Nos 87, 98, 110 and 141, which Ecuador has ratified; (ii) in practice, preventing banana plantation workers from forming a trade union whose members come from more than one company renders it impossible for 20,000 workers in that sector to exercise their trade union rights, since thousands of banana plantations employ fewer than 30 workers, the minimum number of workers required by the Labour Code for the establishment of a trade union; and聽(iii) the refusal to register the trade union constitutes discrimination against banana plantation workers, given that in other sectors in the country the labour administration registers sectoral trade unions, as is shown by the establishment of the SINUTRHE in June聽2016.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3327395, response status: 200"

Observing that section 449 of the Labour Code does not directly prohibit the establishment of trade unions made up of workers from various companies, while other provisions of the Labour Code (especially section 440) broadly recognize the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing, the Committee draws attention to the fact that the free exercise of the right to establish and join trade unions implies free determination of the structure and membership of those trade unions and that workers must be able to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organization, such as an industry or craft union [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, paras 333 and 334]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that, even though the minimum number of 30 workers would be acceptable in the case of sectoral trade unions, this minimum number should be reduced in the case of enterprise unions so as not to hinder the establishment of such bodies, particularly when it is taken into account that the country has a very large proportion of small enterprises and that the trade union structure is based on enterprise unions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3327395, response status: 200"

The Committee recalls that, with respect to rural and agricultural workers in general, Article聽3(3) of Convention No. 141, ratified by Ecuador, provides that the acquisition of legal personality by organizations of rural workers shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the exercise of the right of rural workers to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, to join organizations, of their own choosing without previous authorization. It is also worth recalling that paragraph 8(2)(b)(i) of the Rural Workers鈥?Organisations Recommendation, 1975 (No. 149) underlines the importance of the relevant laws and regulations being adapted to the special needs of rural areas and in particular that requirements regarding minimum membership, minimum levels of education and minimum funds shall not be permitted to prevent the development of organizations in rural areas where the population is scattered, ill-educated and poor. In this connection, the Committee notes with concern that many agricultural workers in Ecuador not only find it actually impossible to set up company unions owing to the minimum membership requirement which is conflicting with the structure of a sector where most production units are small, but that their efforts to overcome that obstacle by grouping together in sectoral organizations are frustrated as well. In this context, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to enable the registration of ASTAC without delay, and to ensure that, in the meantime, the necessary guarantees and protections are provided to its members. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3327395, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that the complainants allege that the number of members of the nascent trade union was reduced by pressure exerted by the company, which resulted in practice in numerous founding members signing sworn statements denying that they had participated in the establishment of the trade union and also took the form of the termination of the contract of those members who refused to sign the sworn statements and of threats of physical violence towards the trade union鈥檚 general secretary. In this connection, the Committee notes that, although the Government was informed that the contracts of many founding members of the trade union had been terminated a few days after the employer had been notified of the registration application, it is silent on the reasons for this termination and says nothing about the holding of investigations to ascertain the truth of the allegations of discriminatory anti-union acts made by the complainants. In this respect, the Committee recalls that anti-union discrimination is one of the most serious violations of freedom of association, as it may jeopardize the very existence of trade unions and that where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [See, Digest, op. cit. paras聽769 and 835]. While it refers to its previous recommendation regarding the minimum union membership required for registration, the Committee likewise requests the Government to ensure that an independent inquiry is held in the near future into the various anti-union acts that are alleged to have taken place around the time the company trade union was founded and that it inform the Committee of the inquiry鈥檚 findings and of any action taken by the public authorities thereupon, including in relation to the registration of the company trade union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3327395, response status: 200"

In this regard, the complaint organization firstly states that, although article 23 of the LOSEP recognizes the right to freedom of association of public servants, the organizations that they can form do not have trade union status, the public agencies responsible for registering these organizations are not specified, and the protective provisions contained in the Labour Code do not apply to them. Secondly, it claims that the LOSEP does not recognize the right of public servants鈥?organizations to negotiate the working conditions and labour relations of their members, and thus violates Article 4 of Convention No. 98 and Article 5(2) of the Nursing Personnel Convention, 1977 (No. 149), according to which, the determination of conditions of employment and work should preferably be made by negotiation between employers鈥?and workers鈥?organizations concerned. The complainant organization furthermore indicates that article聽24 of the LOSEP excludes the right to strike and the exercise thereof. Lastly, the complainant organization adds that the unilateralism demonstrated by the Government in the reforms that it has been implementing excludes any dialogue or consultations with trade union organizations, and that the use of legal and constitutional authorities has been rendered pointless by the control exercised by the Government over the judiciary and the Constitutional Court.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254194, response status: 200"

They state that articles 10 and 13 of the draft amendments provide for the removal of article 229, paragraph 3 and the amendment of article 326, paragraph 16 of the Constitution, which establish that public sector workers are currently covered by the Labour Code. The amendments would therefore bring all public sector employees under the scope of the LOSEP system and other administrative laws.

In light of the above, the Mission considers it appropriate for the Government to initiate, without delay, substantial dialogue with the trade union organizations on the proposed amendments, in order to ensure that the possible transfer of public sector employees from the public system under the Labour Code to the LOSEP system does not cause a further restriction of the collective bargaining rights of public sector employees who are not engaged in the administration of the State. Accordingly, the Mission recalls once again that the ILO is fully prepared to provide technical assistance for the aforementioned dialogue and for the discussions on the amendments within the National Assembly.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254194, response status: 200"

The Committee observes in particular that the aforementioned laws do not recognize the right of public servants to collective bargaining, regardless of whether they are engaged in the administration of the State, and notes that, if the current legislation were maintained, the adoption of the constitutional amendments would increase the restrictions on the collective bargaining rights of public sector employees who are not engaged in the administration of the State.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254194, response status: 200"

The Committee therefore considers that, in light of the draft constitutional amendments, which, if adopted, would extend the application of the LOSEP, it is even more imperative to reform this law, as underscored earlier in these conclusions. While noting the Government鈥檚 statement that the Ministry of Labour would adopt rules to govern the trade union rights of public servants more expressly once the constitutional amendments had been adopted, the Committee observes that it has not received any information on specific initiatives to reform the LOSEP accordingly.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3254194, response status: 200"

The workers informed the inspectors that they had been on strike since 16 October 2011 and that their lawyer would shortly provide them with an official strike notice. The Government also indicates that, according to the company鈥檚 security guards, in the early hours of the morning, a group of hooded individuals armed with sticks who did not belong to the company entered the premises, which led the inspectors to conclude that the work stoppage did not comply with the provisions of sections 467 and 497 of the Labour Code. The labour inspectorate鈥檚 decision to approve the dismissal of 73 workers of the company, taken in accordance with sections聽172 and 183 of the Labour Code, was due to the hostile takeover of the company鈥檚 premises, it being confirmed that the individuals who claimed to act on behalf of the company鈥檚 workers were not in fact their representatives and moreover forcibly took over the company鈥檚 premises in a manner that was both unlawful and arbitrary.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3171938, response status: 200"

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this regard.(d) The Committee requests the Government and the complainant to inform it of any judicial appeals filed against the decisions issued by the labour administration in this case, and expects that a decision will be issued by an independent body, not only on the legality or illegality of the strike, but also on whether the possible perpetration of acts of violence during the strike justified the dismissal of all 73 workers whose employment was terminated as a result of their participation in the strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3171938, response status: 200"

In any case, the Committee can only regret that in the rationalization or staff reduction process, the Government did not consult or try to reach an agreement with the trade union organizations [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, para. 1079]. Here the Committee notes that, in the context of this complaint, the complainant organizations are alleging that the restructuring that was carried out by applying Executive Decree No. 813 was used to dismiss, in a discriminatory manner, a significant number of trade union activists and leaders.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3143970, response status: 200"

It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since workers in both categories should have the right to organize for the defence of their interests [see Digest, op. cit., para. 218]. In this respect, the Committee expects that enjoyment of all the rights upheld in Convention No. 87 will be fully secured for organizations of public servants. The Committee also recalls that anti-union discrimination is one of the most serious violations of freedom of association, as it may jeopardize the very existence of trade unions [see Digest, op. cit., para. 769]. Finally, the Committee has already had occasion repeatedly to state that where public servants are employed under conditions of free appointment and removal from service, the exercise of the right to freely remove public employees from their posts should, in no instance, be motivated by the trade union functions or activities of the persons who could be affected by such measures [see Digest, op. cit., para. 792]. The Committee draws these legislative aspects to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3143970, response status: 200"

The Committee further recalls that the requirement that workers confirm their trade union membership in writing in order to have their union dues deducted from their wages does not violate the principles of freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., para. 476]. In these circumstances, bearing in mind that, as recognized in Ministry of Education circular No.聽082, retentions of trade union dues on behalf of the UNE had previously been taking place, and the decision to suspend them occurred without any special reason, and the cessation of these retentions could very seriously prejudice the UNE, in particular because it was a national organization, the Committee requests the Government that, in line with the practice which it had followed previously, it should immediately restore the deductions of dues of UNE members who had authorized that deduction.

The Government adds that it appealed against the decisions of the court that ordered the registration of the executive committee headed by Mr Jaime Arciniega Aguirre, as well as against the court order to register the executive committee headed by Mr聽Eduardo Valdez Cu帽as. The Committee observes, however, that according to the documentation provided by the complainant organization, the Ministry of Labour registered the executive committee of Mr Jaime Arciniega Aguirre first and then subsequently registered the rival executive committee. Lastly, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, after having considered the applications for amparo (for violation of constitutional rights), on 6 May 2009 the Constitutional Court issued an order to call and hold new elections within a maximum period of 90 days to appoint the new executive committee of the CEOSL; it also ordered the presence of two officials from the Ministry of Labour to act as observers and the assistance of the National Electoral Board.The Committee recalls that it is not competent to make recommendations on internal dissentions within a trade union organization, so long as the government does not intervene in a manner which might affect the exercise of trade union rights and the normal functioning of an organization. The Committee also recalls that, when internal disputes arise in a trade union organization, they should be resolved by the persons concerned (for example, by a vote), by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, paras 1114 and 1122]. In this regard, the Committee notes that the internal dispute in the CEOSL has been brought before a judicial authority and that this authority has indicated the steps to be taken to resolve it, namely the holding of elections in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of those union elections and expects to receive this information as soon as possible. The Committee regrets to note that these elections will be conducted almost two years after the internal conflict occurred and the damage that this has caused to the trade union organization and its members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2911898, response status: 200"

It then goes on to say that regrettably they were despicably deceived by the CNE. The CNE unilaterally drew up 鈥渞egulations鈥?that were contrary to what had been agreed and that allowed the opposing party to participate with delegates up until 25 August 2009 (419 delegates) while the complainant organization鈥檚 sector was permitted to participate as per its list up until 31 July 2009 (219 delegates, with the list also including some delegates from the opposing party).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2911898, response status: 200"

Lastly, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, after having considered the applications for amparo (for violation of constitutional rights), on 6 May 2009 the Constitutional Court issued an order to call and hold new elections within a maximum period of 90 days to appoint the new executive committee of the CEOSL; it also ordered the presence of two officials from the Ministry of Labour to act as observers and the assistance of the National Electoral Board.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2911893, response status: 200"

The Committee also recalls that, when internal disputes arise in a trade union organization, they should be resolved by the persons concerned (for example, by a vote), by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, paras 1114 and 1122]. In this regard, the Committee notes that the internal dispute in the CEOSL has been brought before a judicial authority and that this authority has indicated the steps to be taken to resolve it, namely the holding of elections in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of those union elections and expects to receive this information as soon as possible.

The Committee notes in this respect the subsequent information provided by the complainant organization on the judgment handed down in this respect by the Constitutional Court on 29 September 2021 in favour of the reinstatement of the trade union leaders.

The workers only paid contributions to the works councils corresponding to their subsidiary and those works councils are currently in possession of the union dues in question.

The Government highlights that the previous works councils that made up FETRAPEC, which belonged to the former subsidiaries of E.P.

Ecuadorian legislation does not consider the unilateral termination of an employment relationship to be illegal, provided that the worker is duly compensated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the current Government has approved three times more trade union organizations than other governments and that the proposed new Labour Code, which has been developed with the technical assistance of the ILO, guarantees the right to freedom of association by branch without interference from employers.

In the light of these facts and with regard to the alleged dismissals, the Government states that, on the morning of Wednesday 18 November 2009, the aforementioned Unidad El茅ctrica de Guayaquil workers arbitrarily stopped work for no legitimate reason and began shouting slogans against the authorities of the enterprise. According to the Government, it became clear from the numerous press articles on the incident that the workers had even resorted to the unauthorized use of automobiles to block the entrances to the enterprise鈥檚 premises in order to carry out the stoppage. It should be noted that those automobiles are public property and should only be used for work purposes. The Government states that, in this way, the workers endangered the safety and physical integrity of all the persons present at that time by committing acts that are expressly prohibited by section 46, paragraphs (a) and (b), of the Labour Code. In the light of these facts and as is reflected in the documentation in the possession of the Guayaquil Department of the Ministry of Labour Relations, the dismissals were approved in accordance with the third reason listed in section 172 of the Labour Code, which led the labour inspector, who was acting on behalf of the administrative authority and using the powers conferred on him by section 545, paragraph聽5, of the Labour Code, to approve the dismissal of the workers in question.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3173617, response status: 200"

Ecuador respects the principles enshrined in Convention No. 98 and has on no occasion prohibited free collective bargaining, rather it has regularized such bargaining so that it takes place within the framework of established parameters, which are in keeping with the limitations of the State of Ecuador, its fiscal budget and its constitutional principles, such as those established in article 286 of the Constitution, which provides that: 鈥淎t all levels of Government, public funds shall be managed in a sustainable, responsible and transparent manner and shall seek to achieve economic stability. Permanent expenditure shall be funded with permanent sources of income. Permanent expenditure on health care, education and the judicial system shall take priority and, in exceptional circumstances, shall be funded with non-permanent sources of income鈥? In this connection, the Government also refers to Ministerial Order No. 00155A, which was published in Official Journal No. 455 of 14 October 2008 and lays down the regulations for revising collective labour agreements, in accordance with the provisions of Constituent Resolution聽No. 008, but which does not prevent free collective bargaining, provided that it takes place within the established parameters and is in keeping with the principle enshrined in article 286 of the Constitution and the principles of equality and transparency. Ministerial Order No. 00155A also seeks to ensure equal pay for equal work in the public sector by respecting differences but not excesses and privileges, which cannot be sustained by the budget of the State of Ecuador and which undermine the principle of equity. Thus, Ministerial Order No. 00155A is also final and complies with Ecuadorian legislation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3173617, response status: 200"

In this regard, the Committee notes with concern that national legislation does not grant specific protection against anti-union dismissals and that there is no obligation to motivate the dismissals occurring in this context. In this respect, the Committee recalls that it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. 98, is granted by legislation in cases where employers can in practice, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, dismiss any worker, if the true reason is the worker鈥檚 trade union membership or activities. The Committee also recalls that in a case in which trade union leaders could be dismissed without an indication of the motive, the Committee requested the Government to take steps with a view to punishing acts of anti-union discrimination and to making appeal procedures available to the victims of such acts (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, paras 791 and 807). Based on the abovementioned principles, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures, in full consultation with the social partners, to amend the legislation so as to guarantee specific protection against anti-union discrimination including anti-union dismissals and to establish sufficiently dissuasive sanctions. In addition, observing that the Government did not indicate the grounds on which the trade union leaders concerned have been dismissed, the Committee once again requests the Government to promote without delay the commencement of discussions between FETRAPEC and the company with a view to the reinstatement of the abovementioned trade union leaders.

Moreover, the Committee requests the Government to encourage without delay the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the enterprise with a view to recognition of the trade union organization.(b)	As to the dismissal of the four trade union officials (Mr Edgar de la Cueva, Mr Ramiro Guerrero, Mr John Plaza Garay and Mr Diego Cano Molestina), the Committee requests the Government to encourage the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the enterprise with a view to reinstatement of these union officials. The Committee considers that, as a representative organization, FETRAPEC has a legitimate right to exist and represent its members. However, the Committee also considers that the statutes of this organization should take into account the existence of a new public enterprise and that said organization should hold trade union elections given that the four former subsidiaries no longer exist.

In turn, the Committee requests the Government to indicate: (1) whether the consideration that the four dismissed persons were not trade union officials was related to their dismissal, which might have made them lose that status under Ecuadorian legislation; and (2) the specific facts which motivated the dismissal of those four persons, as it would appear from the Government鈥檚 reply that they were dismissed unilaterally and without any indication of the grounds. The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the sanctions set out in the legislation in the case of arbitrary and unjustified dismissals of trade unionists.(b)	The Committee requests the Government and the authorities competent for issuing labour legislation to hold in-depth consultations in advance and allowing sufficient time with the workers鈥?and employers鈥?organizations concerned in order, as far as possible, to reach shared solutions.(c)	The Committee observes that Constituent Resolutions Nos 002, 004 and Executive Decree No. 1406 set a permanent cap on remuneration in the public sector, compensation for termination of the employment relation and prohibit supplementary private pension schemes which involve contributions of State resources. To the extent that these are permanent limitations on collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to restore the right of collective bargaining on conditions of work and living standards of workers and to inform it accordingly.(d)	As regards the imposition of the revision of clauses of public sector collective agreements by administrative means (declaration of nullity or amendment) which contain excesses and unreasonable privileges (Constituent Resolution No. 008) by unilateral decision of a commission (Ministerial Order No. 00080 and Order No.聽00155A) the Committee emphasizes that control of allegedly abusive clauses of collective agreements should not be up to the administrative authority (which in the public sector is both judge and party), but the judicial authority, and then only in extremely serious cases. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to annul those ministerial texts and their effects since they seriously violate the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining consecrated in Convention No. 98, and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No. 008 is compatible with exclusively judicial control of the possible abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee requests the competent authorities that, if it is wished to amend the result of collective bargaining in the public sector, they should wait until the expiry of the collective agreements and the respective employers should renegotiate their content with the trade union organizations.(e)	The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the collective agreements, which were revised by administrative process, are renegotiated if the trade union organizations confirm the wish to do so.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken to give effect to the various recommendations formulated in this report and, noting the request of the complainant organizations, invites the Government to accept an ILO mission to assist in solving the problems observed in this case.(g)	The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the communications from the CEOSL dated 16 March and 20 May 2009.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3057171, response status: 200"

There is no acceptable legal basis for this statement, which leaves workers whose rights have been expressly violated totally defenceless. The Constituent Assembly received a mandate from the people to prepare a new Constitution and change the country鈥檚 institutional framework. The Assembly exceeded the powers bestowed upon it by the people when it issued those Constituent Resolutions, which through dictatorial action could become immutable instruments by virtue of the fact that they do not exist in the Ecuadorian legal system. In Constituent Resolution No. 002, the public authority, which is also the employer, unilaterally imposes the amendment and deletion of clauses or articles contained in collective agreements and contracts that have been negotiated and legally concluded, ignoring the principle of collective autonomy. Constituent Resolution No. 004 goes even further, expressly affirming that compensation for unfair dismissal set out in legally concluded collective agreements is also referred to. Constituent Resolution No. 008 provides that for the sake of fairness in work, it is necessary to revise and regulate the clauses of unreasonable and excessive collective agreements concluded by minority groups which run counter to the general interest and the workers themselves.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3057171, response status: 200"

The Constituent Resolutions remained in force until the approval of the new Constitution on 20 October 2008 and all the regulations and standards issued by the executive authority and the Ministry of Labour and Employment (now the Ministry of Labour Relations) had to be coherent and in harmony with the provisions of the Constitution.

Public bodies are obliged to submit lists of personnel, stating staff members鈥?responsibilities and activities, to the National Technical Secretariat for Human Resources Development and Public Sector Remuneration (SENRES). Furthermore, according to the Decree, the Secretariat 鈥渟hall proceed to determine which workers shall be subject to the Labour Code or to the conclusion of collective agreements, as the case may be鈥? SENRES also has the power to establish the amounts of compensation paid to those opting for voluntary cessation of service with a view to retirement. FETRAPEC states that the process of determining whether workers shall be subject to the Labour Code or to the conclusion of collective agreements (as referred to above) carried out by SENRES serves two purposes: (1) the redefinition and downgrading of the worker鈥檚 status, through the claim that the tasks that he carries out are purely or mainly manual rather than intellectual; (2) the redefinition of the employment relationship which occurs when a physical person continuously provides services for a public or private employer in a relationship of dependency or subordination and for remuneration. In the petroleum sector workers carry out tasks in both the administrative and operational sectors. Owing to the evolution of technology, there are technicians working in both sectors whose employment relationships are governed by the principle of reality, from both a factual and a legal point of view . Moreover, FETRAPEC states that the aim is to interfere in trade union affairs by altering the statute of workers is to ensure that they continue to be covered by the Organic Law on the Civil Service and Administrative Careers (LOSCCA) (now the Organic Law on the Civil Service (LOSEP)), which makes no provision for either collective bargaining or the right to strike. The complainant organization states that, far from restoring the right to collective bargaining, the Government is on the verge of eliminating it.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3057171, response status: 200"

The CTE denounces the violation of the collective agreement in force and demands the payment of the compensation owed to the workers. Following the voluntary separation of the workers, either through early retirement or cessation of the employment relationship, the enterprise failed to comply with section聽185(2) of the Labour Code, which expressly states that enterprises shall pay the compensation due to the worker, within a non-extendable time period of 15 days, from the legal notification of the request for cessation of the employment relationship and shall settle the amount of the bonuses owed to the worker. After a year or more of waiting to be compensated, the workers initiated a legal action against their former employer who, having agreed to pay them for cessation of employment relationship on a pro-rata basis and to pension them off, never carried out in a rational way the payment of the bonuses and compensation corresponding to voluntary separation and retirement within the time period set out in law and in the collective agreement. The labour complaints were lodged and brought before the labour judges and, once all of the procedural rules had been complied with, the presiding and appeal judges rejected the said complaints on the legal pretext that 鈥渢he time granted under labour legislation to workers (three years) to lodge legal claims against their employers, had expired鈥? It should be pointed out that no examination was ever carried out of the evidence which showed that, owing to the fact that the defendant enterprise had recognized the existence of the debt through partial dismissal payments, the time period in which the workers could bring an action claiming compensation was suspended and interrupted for up to five years from the moment the employment relationships were terminated. The workers lodged appeals with the Supreme Court, which rejected them stating that 鈥渢here was no evidence proving the existence of any facts involving the interruption of the deadline and the suspension of the time period鈥? The CTE states that many of the workers, who were affected by pollution generated as a part of the petroleum refining process, died without receiving compensation. Extraordinary actions for protection were then lodged with the Constitutional Court but were declared inadmissible by the Chamber of Admissions of that court.

Therefore, it has been both demonstrated and proven that the trade union officials, by attending and participating in this act and agreeing in consensus to the Resolutions that clear up a number of their concerns with regard to the revision of their collective agreement, have recognized that this process is completely valid. Furthermore, within the framework of an action for constitutional protection lodged against the chairperson of the committee revising said collective agreement by the Single Trade Union of Workers of Eugenio Espejo Hospital, the constitutional judge stated that the bringer of the action sought recognition for rights expressly prohibited by the Constitution itself and the Resolutions and therefore rejected the action for constitutional protection.

Officials and public servants are under a moral and legal obligation to comply with decisions adopted by the Constituent Assembly. The provisions of both Constituent Resolution No. 008 and the regulations in application clearly and unambiguously establish that the list of clauses which are considered to contain excesses and privileges is only indicative and not exhaustive. The clauses singled out, as examples, by the Constituent Assembly itself and the President of the Republic as being void in law serve as guidelines which must be followed in the process of revision to determine other clauses which also contain excesses and privileges and are contrary to the general interest and which must also be declared void in law.

The Committee observes that, according to the mission report, the Government stated that following the change in the statute of the State enterprise Petr贸leos del Ecuador, FETRAPEC had requested that its statutes be reformed in order to allow it to represent the workers of the new public enterprise E.P. PETROECUADOR, a request that was rejected by the authorities. The Government indicated that, owing to the fact that E.P.PETROECUADOR was a new enterprise rather than the result of a merger of the four subsidiaries that made up the old enterprise, it considered FETRAPEC to be defunct as a trade union body. The Government stated that new elections should be held to form a comit茅 de empresa (the national term for majority union) and highlighted that, in accordance with the law, there is only one comit茅 de empresa in each public enterprise. The Government stated that to date FETRAPEC had not initiated procedures concerning the holding of the proposed elections. The Committee recalls that in the light of Convention No. 87, organizations of workers can only be dissolved voluntarily or through judicial channels and that, consequently, the Government and the employer enterprise cannot consider FETRAPEC to be dissolved as a result of the change of statute of the public enterprise. Moreover, the Committee observes that according to the mission report, although the Government and the enterprise do not recognize FETRAPEC, trade union dues continue to be deducted from the wages of the workers affiliated to the abovementioned trade union organization. FETRAPEC stated that the dues were being held by the Ministry of Labour Relations. The Committee also notes that, according to the mission report, the Ministry of Labour Relations transferred the trade union dues to the enterprise. The Committee highlights that trade union dues do not belong to the authorities, nor are they public funds, but rather they are an amount on deposit that the authorities may not use for any reason other than to remit them to the organization concerned without delay [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, 2006, para. 479]. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the trade union dues are immediately returned to the workers and to keep it informed in that regard. Moreover, the Committee understands that the workers affiliated to FETRAPEC continue to work for the newly-created enterprise E.P. PETROECUADOR. The Committee requests the Government to encourage the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the enterprise with a view to recognition of the trade union organization. Finally, the Committee highlights that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that the workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination relating to their jobs, in particular trade union officials. Taking note of the fact that the Government has not provided information on the dismissal of Mr Edgar de la Cueva, Mr聽Ramiro Guerrero, Mr聽John Plaza Garay and Mr Diego Cano Molestina, the Committee requests the Government to encourage without delay the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the enterprise with a view to the reinstatement of the abovementioned trade union officials.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:3057171, response status: 200"

However, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the trade union organizations (OSUNTRAMSA and CEOSL) highlighted that they were not calling into question the provisions of the abovementioned Constituent Resolutions but rather the provisions promulgated as a consequence of those Resolutions (Ministerial Orders Nos 00080 and 00155A). They indicated that their collective agreements in the public sector were rendered devoid of any of the rights that they had acquired and that the legal provisions were not respected given that there was no real bargaining process concerning the collective agreements but rather the ministerial authorities unilaterally imposed a series of amendments to the collective agreements.

PETROECUADOR, denounce the violation of the collective agreement in force and demand payment of the compensation due to them. The Committee notes that, according to the CTE, following the voluntary separation of the workers, either through early retirement or cessation of the employment relationship, the enterprise failed to comply with section 185(2) of the Labour Code, which expressly states that enterprises shall pay the compensation due to the worker, within a non-extendable time period of 15聽days as of the legal notification of the request for cessation of the employment relationship and shall settle the amount of the bonuses owed to the worker. The Committee notes in particular that: (1) the workers decided to bring a claim against their former employer; (2) the employer enterprise agreed to pay them for the cessation of employment relationship on a pro-rata basis and to pension them off, although the enterprise never carried out in a rational way the payment of the bonuses and compensation corresponding to voluntary separation and retirement within the time period provided for by law and in the collective agreement; (3) the claims were rejected in the first and second instances given that 鈥渢he time granted under labour legislation to workers (three years) to lodge legal claims against their employers, had expired鈥? (4) the Supreme Court rejected the appeal, stating that 鈥渢here was no evidence proving the existence of any facts involving the interruption of the deadline and the suspension of the statute of limitation鈥?

Moreover, the Committee requests the Government to encourage without delay the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the enterprise with a view to recognition of the trade union organization.(b)	As to the dismissal of the four trade union officials (Mr Edgar de la Cueva, Mr Ramiro Guerrero, Mr John Plaza Garay and Mr Diego Cano Molestina), the Committee requests the Government to encourage the initiation of discussions between FETRAPEC and the enterprise with a view to reinstatement of these union officials. The Committee considers that, as a representative organization, FETRAPEC has a legitimate right to exist and represent its members. However, the Committee also considers that the statutes of this organization should take into account the existence of a new public enterprise and that said organization should hold trade union elections given that the four former subsidiaries no longer exist. Finally, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the trade union dues are immediately returned to the workers and to keep it informed in that regard.(c)	The Committee requests the Government once again to annul the abovementioned Ministerial Orders and their effects, since they seriously violate the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. 98, and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No. 008 is compatible with an exclusively judicial control of the possibly abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to continue to promote dialogue with the representative trade union organizations and to keep it informed of developments, in particular concerning the meetings with the trade union representatives and the work of the CNT.

Furthermore, the application mentions anti-trade union reprisals as a consequence of a press release in the name and representation of the trade union organization establishing guidelines for the definition of petroleum policy and complaints against the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum. The application was refused for reasons of form (failure previously to exhaust the ordinary legal remedies). Nevertheless, given that the Government has raised the question of the receivability of the complaint, making it subject to evidence of the status of trade union official of the signatories of the complaint (four of them dismissed), the Committee requests FETRAPEC to confirm the status of trade union official of the signatories of the complaint, including the dismissed persons, for example, by sending the minutes of the general meeting in which they were elected by their trade union organization, grass-roots union or federation. In turn, the Committee requests the Government to indicate: (1)聽whether the consideration that the four dismissed persons were not trade union officials was related to their dismissal, which might have made them lose that status under Ecuadorian legislation, and (2) the 鈥渟pecific facts鈥?which motivated the dismissal of those four persons, as it would appear from the Government鈥檚 reply that they were dismissed unilaterally and without any indication of the grounds. The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the sanctions set out in the legislation in the case of arbitrary and unjustified dismissals of trade unionists. The Committee recalls paragraph 33 of its procedures, whereby the Committee has not regarded any complaint as being irreceivable simply because the government in question had dissolved, or proposed to dissolve, the organization on behalf of which the complaint was made, or because the person or persons making the complaint had taken refuge abroad.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2911731, response status: 200"

The Committee recalls that limitations on the free determination of wages in collective bargaining are only acceptable in exceptional circumstances. In this respect, the Committee has indicated that 鈥淚f, as part of its stabilization policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers鈥?living standards鈥?[see Digest, op. cit., para. 1024].

Moreover, this may have a detrimental effect on workers鈥?interests in unionization, since members and potential members could consider useless joining an organization, the main objective of which is to represent its members in collective bargaining, if the results of such bargaining are constantly cancelled by law [see Digest, op. cit., para. 1019]. The Committee also recalls that the right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and trade unions should have the right, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to seek to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent. The public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.

The Committee emphasizes that control of clauses of public sector agreements for possible abuse should not be up to the administrative authority, since it cannot be both judge and party, but a matter for the judicial authority, and then only in extremely serious cases, and not for just any significant benefit which has been agreed. The Committee therefore requests the Government that control of allegedly abusive clauses of collective agreements should only be carried out through the courts, so as to ensure impartiality, the right of defence and due process. The Committee observes that in the present case, the decisions of the administrative authorities are not subject to any appeal whatsoever, whether administrative or judicial and considers that the current regulations, especially the instruments of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, which allow it unilaterally to declare void or reduce a wide range of clauses of collective agreements, is a serious violation of the principle of free and voluntary bargaining. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to annul those ministerial texts and their effects and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No. 008 is compatible with exclusively judicial control (not administrative) of the possible abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee requests the authorities that, if it is wished to amend the result of collective bargaining, it should wait until the expiry of the collective agreements and the respective employers should renegotiate their content with the trade union organizations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2911731, response status: 200"

In turn, the Committee requests the Government to indicate: (1) whether the consideration that the four dismissed persons were not trade union officials was related to their dismissal, which might have made them lose that status under Ecuadorian legislation; and (2) the 鈥渟pecific facts鈥?which motivated the dismissal of those four persons as it would appear from the Government鈥檚 reply that they were dismissed unilaterally and without any indication of the grounds. The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the sanctions set out in the legislation in the case of arbitrary and unjustified dismissals of trade unionists.(b) The Committee requests the Government and the authorities competent for issuing labour legislation to hold in-depth consultations in advance and allowing sufficient time with the workers鈥?organizations concerned in order, as far as possible, to reach shared solutions.(c) The Committee observes that Constituent Resolutions Nos 002, 004 and Executive Decree No. 1406 set a permanent cap on remuneration in the public sector, compensation for termination of the employment relation and prohibit supplementary private pension schemes which involve contributions of State resources. To the extent that these are permanent limitations on collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to restore the right of collective bargaining on conditions of work and living standards of workers and to inform it accordingly.(d) As regards the imposition of the revision of clauses of public sector collective agreements by administrative means (declaration of nullity or amendment) which contain excesses and unreasonable privileges (Constituent Resolution No. 008) by unilateral decision of a commission (Ministerial Order No. 00080 and Order No. 00155A) the Committee emphasizes that control of allegedly abusive clauses of collective agreements should not be up to the administrative authority (which in the public sector is both judge and party), but the judicial authority, and then only in extremely serious cases. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to annul those ministerial texts and their effects since they seriously violate the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining consecrated in Convention No. 98, and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No. 008 is compatible with exclusively judicial control of the possible abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee requests the competent authorities that, if it is wished to amend the result of collective bargaining, that they should wait until the expiry of the collective agreements and the respective employers should renegotiate their content with the trade union organizations.(e) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the collective agreements, which were revised by administrative process, are renegotiated if the trade union organizations confirm the wish to do so.(f) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken to give effect to the various recommendations formulated in this report and, noting the request of the complainant organizations, invites the Government to accept an ILO mission to assist in solving the problems observed in this case.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the communications from the CEOSL dated 16 March and 20 May 2009.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2911731, response status: 200"

The complainant organization alleges that the response of the Supreme Court and the National Judiciary Council was to harass and penalize the union members and officials. Specifically, the complainant indicates that, without there being any legal competence for doing so and in violation of the principles of due process, the following union members and officials were dismissed: Mr Luis Hern谩n Mu帽oz Pasquel, Mr Jos茅 Barcia, Mr Girard David Vernaza Arroyo, Ms Josefa Clementina Mendoza Zambrano, Mr Jaime Fabi谩n P茅rez S谩nchez, Ms Alba Rosa Quinteros Campa帽a and Mr聽Milton Pazmi帽o Soria, citing alleged blatant and serious misconduct in the performance of their duties.

The Ministry of Labour has confined itself to pursuing the administrative procedure for registration of the union, and in this context it noted that the union lacked the minimum membership required, and some of the members even had probationary contracts, which meant that they did not remain in the company so as to follow up their claim to form a union. As is noted in the inspection report, four of the workers who previously wished to set up a union were interviewed, and the employer was informed in their presence of the right of workers to freedom of association and the employer鈥檚 obligation to refrain from interfering in trade union affairs, and that if in future attempts were made to do this, things would proceed according to the law.

It was noted that the workers involved in the internal dispute have lost any legal right to act as representatives among themselves, and the majority have clearly indicated to the labour authority that they do not wish to take collective action. The reasons of the party that initiated the administrative action are not known, since it did not appear before the labour authority to set out its case, as indicated in the statement by the Quito Labour Department dated 14 September 2000; the Ministry cannot pursue the action as there is an express application to revoke the collective claim, with the signatures required, and this is not opposed. The Government attaches a communication dated August 2000 signed by the workers of Hotel Chalet Suisse, stating that the collective claim was submitted without any consultations with them, and demanding that it be set aside; as well as a statement by the General Department of Labour dated 14 September 2000, which notes that those who presented the collective claim did not appear, although they were invited to do so and to attend a meeting on the abovementioned communication of August 2000.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906348, response status: 200"

This would also make it possible to rationalize public spending especially with regard to the payment of public servants鈥?salaries, without this resulting in any loss of value. This consolidation in no way restricted bargaining or any wage increases that might be won in the private sector by collective bargaining.

However, it is hard to believe that having got as far as announcing that they were forming a trade union, they suddenly resigned, and it is not possible to know what actually happened since the workers in question have now left the company and there exist termination statements duly legalized, in accordance with section 592 of the Labour Code.The documents supplied by the Government indicate that six workers ended their employment with the company by mutual agreement (most of them in December 2000) and four others had probationary contracts dated 1995 (two), 1998 (one) and 2000 (one).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906348, response status: 200"
Case No 2138 (Ecuador),14-May-01,The Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organizations (CEOSL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),"['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906350', 'f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906348', 'f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906351', 'f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906353']","852.Under these circumstances, taking into account the fact that the version of events given by the new manager was not accepted by the labour inspectorate, the Committee cannot rule out the possibility that in 2000 the new trade union had ceased to have the legal minimum membership for registration as a result of anti-union practices. As the allegations go back to 2000, it might be difficult to reinstate the dismissed workers, especially given the labour inspection report which appears to indicate that the whereabouts of those concerned are not known. Nevertheless, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that no person is prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of their trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present. It recalls that where a government has undertaken to ensure that the free exercise of trade union rights shall be guaranteed by appropriate measures, that guarantee, in order to be effective, should when necessary be accompanied by measures which include the protection of workers against anti-union discrimination in their employment. The Committee therefore requests the Government to undertake all necessary efforts to locate the workers in question, so that they may be reinstated in the company or, if that is impossible, they receive adequate compensation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2906348, response status: 200"

The Committee recalls that the Collective Agreements Recommendation, 1951 (No. 91), stresses the role of workers鈥?organizations as one of the parties in collective bargaining; it refers to representatives of unorganized workers only when no organization exists.

This is where social violence, caused by persons armed with all sorts of objects, erupted to a peak. All the residents of that sector, including those without any trade union link, participated spontaneously into the protests which culminated in acts of extreme violence and looting, during which the police and armed forces intervened to put an end to violations of public and private property. That is when a stray bullet mortally wounded Mr. Mena who was going home, as explained by his family; Mr. Mena was not taking part in the strike; his death was a most unfortunate accident, without any particular culprit. Mr. Javier Bone, who was not a union member, died in the City of Esmeraldas; he was mortally wounded during a violent protest, while in that same city, a bank was pilfered and a church stoned, which indicates the true nature of these protests; he was killed by a stray bullet, an unfortunate fatality during a situation of general violence. A third person died in the city of Manabi, when the hand grenade of a protester was confiscated, leading to the death of policeman Jos茅 Bowen Men茅ndez. In these chaotic circumstances, trying to blame trade unionists or the Government for these most regrettable incidents does not serve any purpose.

CONAUTEL has been representing the workers of EMETEL in negotiations and the signing of collective labour agreements.

In order to comply with the provisions of the first clause of section 1, of Article 49 of the Political Constitution of Ecuador (which sets out that: ""for all purposes of labour relations in bodies in the public sector, the labour sector shall be represented by one single organization""), CONAUTEL submitted its Statutes for approval by the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources: the said approval was implemented through Accord No. 210 and was registered in the General Directorate of Labour on 8 August 1996, thus constituting CONAUTEL as the only representative organization of workers in the public sector.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904226, response status: 200"

Although the administrative authorities did not have the authority to get involved in the activities of the union organization CONAUTEL, the latter proceeded to call for elections, since the Ministerial Resolution allowed the call to elections to be made by the union organization itself, under the supervision of the General Directorate of Labour, throughout the whole process of electing the Board in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of their Statutes. All of this was communicated to the Ministry of Labour in communication No. 239-96 CONAUTEL, dated 3 October 1996. In reply to this communication (No. 239-96 CONAUTEL), the authorities of the Sub-secretariat of Labour, yet again violating freedom of association, stated: ""Permit me to remind you that any election process must be made jointly with the Director-General of Labour, therefore what you have carried out digresses from the terms of the ministerial resolution of 26 September 1996, and for this reason lacks validity."" Subsequently, the Director-General of Labour issued an illegal and arbitrary instrument for elections to the Board of CONAUTEL, without knowledge of this body, and obliged the organization to sign an agreement for elections to the Board of CONAUTEL, setting up an electoral tribunal illegally and with persons foreign to CONAUTEL, with electoral lists which gave votes to people outside the organization.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904226, response status: 200"

(The CTE supports the Board presided over by Ms. Hoyos.) The decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Ecuador was preceded by strong support from the State Attorney General's office. In the union elections, Mr. Agapito Moreira, current President of CONAUTEL, came out as the winner, along with an Executive Committee made up of various workers from the enterprise EMETEL. None the less, the decision of the Constitutional Court disregards the results of these free and democratic elections.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904226, response status: 200"

This electoral process included the participation of Ms. Greta Hoyos, who headed the losing list. These elections were carried out within the legal norms in force in the country and totally in accordance with the principles set out in ILO Convention No. 87; (2) Mr. Agapito Moreira and the Executive Committee of CONAUTEL took possession of their posts in a ceremony which included the participation of the Minister of Labour and Human Resources, of other national authorities and of the top leaders of the Ecuadorean Central Organization of Class Organizations (CEDOC/CLAT); (3) the enterprise itself and CONAUTEL gave their full recognition to the new Board of CONAUTEL; and (4) Ms. Greta Hoyos had recourse on several occasions to various types of political influence to try to establish non-recognition of the new Board of CONAUTEL and the legal powers themselves rejected her false claim. So, it is alarming to receive information which demonstrates that the Constitutional Court and the State Attorney-General are involved in issues which are the exclusive affair of the workers, such as the election of their own appropriate authorities, thus making themselves directly responsible for an act of open interference in the internal affairs of a trade union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904226, response status: 200"

On 3 December, the executive chairman of PETROECUADOR (and legal representative of the said enterprise) went for an audience with the Provincial Labour Inspector of Pichincha to request the immediate dismissal of Mr. Iv谩n Narv谩ez Qui帽贸nez, President of FETRAPEC (National Federation of Workers of the State Petroleum Enterprise of Ecuador) and officer of CETAPE (Single Enterprise Committee of Workers of PETROECUADOR). Having been notified of this decision, the union officer presented himself at the instructed time at the Pichincha Labour Inspectorate to contest this decision which he considered completely unfounded and illegal. Certain declarations by the Minister of Energy and Mines, in which he describes this union leader in very negative and disrespectful terms, lead CLAT to conclude that this dismissal - like the previous ones - also has an anti-union nature and moreover violates union immunity.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904181, response status: 200"

In this context, there is serious reason to fear for the life and physical integrity of the union officers in this enterprise. In view of what has been set out previously, the union officers of PETROECUADOR enterprise cannot freely carry out their activities in defence of workers' rights.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904181, response status: 200"

The manager of PETROINDUSTRIAL, by means of resolution No. 97029, dated 27 March 1997, on the basis of Executive Decree No. 92, published in Official Register No. 13, supplement dated 28 February 1997, determined to remove from force resolution No. 96063, dated 1 October 1996, by means of which Mr. Marcelo Rom谩n was relieved of his duties as industrial technician class II in the state refinery of Esmeraldas, restoring him to his post and granting him his corresponding rights, that is to say the remunerations, salary and emoluments not received from the date of his suspension until his reinstatement. The Government annexes to its reply a copy of resolution No. 97029 and contract record No. 97003 which Mr. Marcelo Rom谩n signed in the presence of the Labour Inspector of Pichincha;- the smear campaign against the workers of PETROECUADOR and the case of Ms. Olga Chamba. In connection with the insults hurled at the workers of PETROECUADOR by the ex-Minister of Energy and Mines, these were denounced and in due course brought as a complaint by the workers before the President of the Supreme Court of Justice because of the immunity held by the Minister (precluding his being tried in a lower court). According to Ecuadorian legislation, slander offences can only be pursued and judged through personal accusation; therefore it is necessary for the injured (slandered) persons to institute proceedings individually;- the dismissal of Miss Olga Chamba. She has been reinstated to her duties in PETROECUADOR and has signed contract record No. 97016, dated 11 April 1997, by means of which she is granted all her rights infringed upon during the government of ex-President Abdal谩 Bucaram Ortiz, infringements which were rectified by Executive Decree No. 92, issued by the interim government of President Fabi谩n Alarc贸n. When Ms. Chamba was reinstated to her position, she was granted the pay and remunerations not received during the time that she was away from the enterprise. The Government annexes to its reply a copy of contract record No. 97016, dated 11 April 1997, signed between the executive chairman of PETROECUADOR and the above-mentioned worker;- the dismissal of Mr. Germ谩nico Avila Acosta. The acting manager of PETROCOMERCIAL, a subsidiary enterprise of PETROECUADOR, signed on 17 March 1997 the contract by means of which Mr. Germ谩nico Avila Acosta was reinstated to his position as administrative specialist class II, the same function that he was performing at the time of his removal. In the same way, PETROCOMERCIAL granted him the pay of his salary, remunerations and emoluments which the said worker had ceased to receive from the date that his dismissal came into force until his reinstatement. The Government annexes to its reply a copy of the contract record signed on 17 March 1997 between engineer Alberto Burbano and Mr. Germ谩nico Avila;- public declarations and smears made by the Minister of Energy. The ex-Minister of Energy and Mines, on various occasions and by different modes of communication, hurled insults, slander and threats against the workers of the PETROECUADOR system and its unions, as part of a state policy with a trend towards repressing and infringing upon the rights of workers, a situation which ended once the National Congress relieved ex-President Abdal谩 Bucaram of his duties on 5 February 1997; the actions taken are the exclusive and personal responsibility of the protagonist;- resolution No. 270-CAD-96, of 8 October 1996. With regard to the said resolution which ordered a request for the Inspector-General of State to make a special examination of the expenses and revenues received by union organizations of the PETROECUADOR system, the Government states that the secretary-general of CETAPE presented an appeal for habeas corpus to the Constitutional Court and it is this body that must rule on the legality of the resolution opposed by the union organization; in the meantime the resolution is in suspension until the Constitutional Court gives its verdict;- the dismissal of Mr. Iv谩n Narv谩ez. Mr. Iv谩n Narv谩ez Qui帽贸nez performed the duties of environmental protection specialist class II in the environmental protection unit of PETROECUADOR until 2 January 1997, date on which the Labour Inspector of Pichincha gave approval to terminate labour relations with this worker. On the legal basis of Executive Decree No. 92, Mr. Iv谩n Narv谩ez was reinstated in PETROECUADOR through resolution No. 97028, dated 21 March 1997, and the enterprise paid all that it owed to the said worker which he had not received from November 1996 until his reinstatement in the enterprise. It should be pointed out that Mr. Iv谩n Narv谩ez was reinstated as chief of the environmental protection unit. The Government annexes to its reply a copy of contract record No. 97028, signed on 18 April 1997 between Dr. Rafael Almeida Mancheno and Mr. Iv谩n Narv谩ez Qui帽贸nez;- raiding of trade union premises. The ex-Minister of Energy and Mines raided the premises of CETAPE (Single Enterprise Committee of Workers of PETROECUADOR) and of FETRAPEC (National Federation of Workers of the State Petroleum Enterprise of Ecuador) and placed them in the custody of private security guards. Aware of this situation, the new authorities of the enterprise arranged to hand over the premises to representatives of the labour organizations affected, once the said minister ceased his duties.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2904181, response status: 200"

The complainant organization adds that on 23 March 1994, before the term of the fourth collective agreement expired, the municipal workers' union communicated a draft fifth collective agreement to the municipality, through the labour inspectorate. In its letter notifying the inspectorate, the trade union explained that there were no changes in the agreement as regards employment stability. According to the complainant organization, on 26 March 1994 the municipal authorities accepted certain clauses of the draft agreement that had been presented to it and requested that others be amended or removed. After the bargaining period had been extended, both parties concluded their negotiations on 10 June 1994, but on 27 June 1994 the municipal authorities stated that they were unable to sign the fifth collective agreement since the municipal budget for the year 1994 had not been approved, and they therefore ended the negotiations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903392, response status: 200"

Lastly, the complainant organization states that the decision of the Tribunal cannot be appealed at national level, but it adds that the trade union filed a petition requesting that certain points be clarified and its decision expanded on, and that this appeal had been rejected by the majority of the Tribunal on 11 November 1994 (two of its members opposed the majority vote).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2903392, response status: 200"

The complainant organization states that, although it complied with every requirement under section 439 of the Ecuadorean Labour Code and sent the appropriate documentation to the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources on 12 March 1993, the Director-General of Labour returned this documentation to the FAELE on 12 April 1993, refusing to inscribe the organization in the corresponding registry, on the grounds that ""in order to create a federation or confederation, there must be as many constituent organizations as the number required for creating trade unions, in accordance with sections 439 and 446 of the Labour Code.""

The complainant organization points out that, although the legal situation was carefully explained, the documentation was again returned after the expiry of the 30-day deadline set in section 440 of the Labour Code - in other words, the provisions of paragraph 2 of this section were not complied with (section 440: Register of occupational associations.

Specifically involved are the Hospital Assistants Unions of the San Lazaro and Pablo Arturo Suarez Hospitals and the Vicente Corral Moscoso Hospital of Cuenca, the Hospital Assistants Union of the Province of Loja and the Hospital Assistants Union of the Province of Cotopaxi.

The complainant organization alleges that workers in the following enterprises have been left unemployed after having been paid to resign: Dinace, Ieos, Obras Publicas Fiscales, Enprovit, Enac, Iearac, and Inec, to name the main ones. In the private sector, mass dismissals have taken place at Ecuarosas, Astra, Hallburton, Indulana, Pintex, Industrias Quimicas Novel, la Tejedora, Infarma and others. It adds that all this is undermining the trade union movement in Ecuador; consequently, workers who belong to the Confederation have emphatically opposed the mass dismissal of trade unionists, the illegal lockouts at certain enterprises, the payment of workers to resign under the modernization plan, and the downsizing of the state sector, all of which have merely increased unemployment in Ecuador.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

The Government adds that this basic guarantee of the right to organize is provided for under the law on the public service and administrative career in the case of public servants, and under the Labour Code in the case of workers in the private and public sector and those in public enterprises.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

In the specific case of the hospital assistants in the national public health system, there has indeed been confusion and differing criteria concerning the labour regulations applicable to them. The Government states that in order to establish clear-cut criteria in this regard, a legal opinion handed down on 9 August 1990 by the State Attorney General's office indicated that by virtue of the nature of the work carried out by hospital assistants and the degree of training required to obtain a public post of this type, ""the characteristics are such that this group should exercise its rights and fulfil its obligations as provided for by the law on the public service and administrative career"". Therefore, since the question of the labour regulations applicable to hospital assistants is clear, there is clearly no justification for the establishment of trade unions. If some sort of organization of hospital assistants is desired, the proper procedure would be to create them under the law on the public service and administrative career and to exercising the rights provided for by this law.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

To establish an occupational association, section 439 states inter alia that the number of employees ""shall be not less than 30 members"". This is the only reference to a number in this paragraph, and section 446, which defines the scope of the paragraph, states that ""federations and confederations and also associations of salaried personnel in private employment"" are covered by these rules. In other words, the requirement concerning number as stipulated for lower-level trade unions applies to the establishment of federations. The Government states that the national authorities guarantee without restriction the right to organize of those who come under the Labour Code, and that between August 1993 and August 1994 the Department of Workers' Organizations of the Ministry of Labour registered 60 workers' organizations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes the Government's statement that under section 439 of the Labour Code at least 30 members are required to form a workers' organization, and that this provision is also applicable to the number of lower-level trade unions needed to create a federation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

On the one hand, the Government states that, according to a decision by the State Attorney-General, hospital assistants are governed by the law on the public service and administrative career and not by the Labour Code; on the other hand, it cites a provision from this same Code relative to the minimum number of trade unions required to constitute a federation in order to refuse registration of the Federation of Free Hospital Assistants of Ecuador.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that in this case the situation is even more serious, since the authorities are demanding a minimum of 30 trade unions. In these circumstances, and drawing the Government's attention to the fact that legislation which requires an excessively high minimum number of trade unions to establish a higher-level organization conflicts with Article 5 of Convention No. 87 and with the principles of freedom of association, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to modify the legislation in force and its application so as to guarantee that there are no obstacles to the freedom to establish federations and confederations. The Committee also urges the Government to register the Federation of Free Hospital Assistants of Ecuador (FAELE) and to keep it informed in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

According to the Government, such workers do not enjoy the right to organize as guaranteed by the Labour Code since they are considered to be public servants. Although the Government states that under the law on the public service and administrative career these workers may form associations, the Committee points out that under that law workers who are members of such associations have fewer rights than do trade unionists (e.g., as regards collective bargaining). Accordingly, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that ""the denial of the right of workers in the public sector to set up trade unions ... with the result that their associations' do not enjoy the same advantages and privileges as trade unions' involves discrimination as regards government-employed workers and their organizations, as compared with private sector workers and their organizations. Such a situation gives rise to the question of compatibility of these distinctions with Article 2 of Convention No. 87, according to which workers without distinction whatsoever' shall have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 3rd edition, 1985, para. 216).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

In such circumstances, the Committee considers it unacceptable that public servants cannot freely exercise the right to organize as guaranteed by Convention No. 87. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to modify the legislation in force so that public servants are free to establish and join organizations of their own choosing and to register the hospital assistants trade unions which have been denied registration (the Hospital Assistants Unions of the San Lazaro and Pablo Arturo Suarez Hospitals and the Vicente Corral Moscoso Hospital of Cuenca, the Hospital Assistants Union of the Province of Loja and the Hospital Assistants Union of the Province of Cotopaxi). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect and draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to the legislative aspects of this case.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902993, response status: 200"

There are lacunae in this respect in the Act respecting narcotic and psychotropic substances which was promulgated in September 1990, which says nothing about these obligations. What the Act does prescribe is that the National Council for the Control of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances - CONSEP - shall act as the depository of confiscated assets and in the final instance dispose of them, either provisionally or definitively. However, in this case CONSEP has not yet been able to assume its role as the legal depository of confiscated assets, so that the assets continue to be held in the custody of the police.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902876, response status: 200"

In the case in question, a labour inspector personally visited the El Prado ranch in May 1993 and noted that it employed 17 agricultural workers. The Ministry of Labour and Human Resources therefore refused to register this organization. It should be noted that almost nine months passed between establishment of the special committee (an ad hoc organization exclusively responsible for the representation of the workers during the settlement of the labour dispute) in September 1992 and that of the works council in May 1993 and that during this period some workers who had ceased to be employed by the El Prado ranch had nevertheless participated in the establishment of the works council as if they still had been working in the El Prado ranch.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902876, response status: 200"

In this respect, the Committee would like to emphasize that in a previous case concerning Ecuador (see 284th report, Case No. 1617, para. 1006), in examining the provisions of Ecuadorian legislation, it considered that the minimum number of 30 workers ""should be reduced in the case of works councils so as not to hinder the establishment of such bodies, particularly when it is taken into account that the country has a very large proportion of small enterprises and that the trade union structure is based on enterprise unions"". The Committee reiterates this conclusion, requests once again the Government to take measures to amend legislation accordingly, and must point out that it is precisely because workers were illegally dismissed during the labour dispute that the legal minimum number of workers required by the legislation in question could not be met. In these circumstances, the Committee repeats its previous conclusion respecting the reinstatement in their jobs of all workers illegally dismissed and requests the Government to register the trade union of workers in the El Prado ranch.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902876, response status: 200"

The complainant organization points out that after the elections held in January 1993, Ms. Greta Hoyos, the Chairman of CONAUTEL, was replaced by Mr. Abd贸n Logro帽o Losada, Chairman of the Samuel Morse organization affiliated to the PTTI. Since then Mr. Logro帽o has been carrying out the duties of lawful Chairman of CONAUTEL. As a result of negotiations for a collective agreement and of the strong position maintained by CONAUTEL, the EMETEL company subsequently decided unilaterally, in violation of the agreement signed with CONAUTEL, to negotiate and quickly sign the collective agreement with Ms. Hoyos, who is General Secretary of a telephone operators' union of which 143 of the 7,800 EMETEL employees are members. The agreement contained terms which were much less favourable than those demanded by the other organizations which currently have a total of 6,400 members among the employees. It points out that the collective agreement was unlawfully registered by the Ministry of Labour, since it does not meet the requirements laid down by the law, and that members were ordered to pay a contribution of 5,000 sucres, which only the trade union general meetings - which were not held - were competent to decide. This contribution was thus deducted from workers' wages by the enterprise.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902783, response status: 200"

Concerning the alleged dismissal of Mr. Ra煤l Barahona Pasquel, the Government states that this worker was neither removed from his post nor dismissed, but that on 15 April 1993 he handed in his resignation to the enterprise and requested permission to retire after having completed the length of service required by law, which the enterprise granted. Concerning the allegation that the Treasury Inspector's Office had granted approval (authorizations of dismissal) for the dismissal of 11 union leaders of SINTIETEL (City of Guayaquil), including the workers N茅stor P茅rez Valencia, Johny Ramirez, Vicente Ayala and Piedad Loor, the Government states that EMETEL requested the approval of the labour authorities of the City of Guayaquil in order to terminate the employment relationships with these workers; however, once the waiting period had expired, the authorities established that the enterprise had failed to give evidence of the grounds cited in requesting approval, which was denied as a result. The Government explains that the ""approval"" procedure (visto bueno) refers to a request submitted by the employer or the worker for the labour authorities to authorize termination of the employment relationship. In order to obtain this approval, the applicant must provide legal proof to the labour inspectorate that the prerequisites laid down in the Labour Code have been met, and that the accused party has exercised his right to defence. The grounds expressly cited in legal provisions refer to discipline, compliance with contractual obligations, aptitude for work and morality. The granting of approval has the effect of dissolving the employment relationship without giving rise to entitlement to any compensation, which is described as warranted dismissal. Unwarranted dismissal is, on the contrary, an illegal and arbitrary act.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902783, response status: 200"

Faced with a situation where two executives of the single central committee existed side by side, and with an apparent internal struggle for control, the labour inspectorate carried out an investigation and decided to reject the petition of Mr. Abd贸n Logro帽o Losada's group as being without factual or legal grounds, having ascertained by consulting handwriting experts that the 4,000 signatures of support presented by these workers were the same that had been presented by the executive headed by Ms. Hoyos. In other words, the complainants had attempted to deceive the labour authorities by presenting documents in support of their petition which in fact belonged to the original executive of 8 December 1992.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902783, response status: 200"

The Government, in general terms and without referring only to the present case, deplores the fact that disagreements between trade union leaders lead them to adopt belligerent attitudes which ultimately lead to detentions. The Government states further that the EMETEL enterprise comprises 85 trade unions at national level, affilated to 11 national federations, which themselves are affiliated to the four central organizations recognized within the country, and that this complaint reflects the struggle for hegemony among the country's main central organizations of workers.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902783, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that according to the Government, faced with a situation where two executives of the single central committee exist side by side (this committee being the body authorized to negotiate and sign collective agreements on the workers' behalf) and with an apparent internal struggle among trade unions for control, the labour inspectorate carried out an investigation and decided to reject the petition of Mr. Abd贸n Logro帽o Losada's group as being without factual or legal grounds, having ascertained by consulting handwriting experts that the signatures of support presented by these workers in February 1993 were the same signatures that had been presented by the executive headed by Ms. Hoyos in December 1992. In this respect, the Committee recalls that it is not competent to make recommendations on internal dissensions within a trade union organization, so long as the Government does not intervene in a manner which might affect the exercise of trade union rights and the normal functioning of an organization (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 3rd edition, 1985, para. 666). In the Committee's view, there is nothing to indicate in this case that the Government has interfered in the conflict among trade unions; on the contrary, when the enterprise requested information as to which was the legal executive with which it should bargain, the labour inspectorate carried out an investigation of the matter. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902783, response status: 200"

In addition, regarding the alleged authorizations of dismissal of 11 trade union leaders of SINTIETEL (City of Guayaquil), the Committee notes the Government's observations to the effect that the dismissals were not authorized and that therefore the workers were not dismissed. Concerning the alleged dismissals of the general secretaries of FEDETEL and SINDO-IETEL, Messrs. C茅sar Jara Pullas and Fernando Garc铆a, as a result of protests and strikes, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied.

The application of these principles also guarantees, in the view of the Government, that the collective agreements concluded within a sector are fully observed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902297, response status: 200"

The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization objects to the fact that the verification of expenditures that would be necessitated by a draft collective agreement, were the parties to sign it, is not carried out by the public institution or undertaking involved in its negotiation, but by the National Secretariat for Administrative Development, which is responsible for issuing a preliminary opinion. In the view of the Committee, it should not be excluded that this body might also formulate recommendations in line with Government economic policy or seek to ensure that the collective bargaining process does not give rise to any discrimination in the working conditions of the employees in different public institutions or undertakings.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902297, response status: 200"

Specifically, CEOSL objects to the following provisions of Act No. 133:- Section 39(1), second paragraph, which stipulates that collective bargaining must take place at a specified territorial level (national, regional, provincial or section) and requires that an ad hoc negotiating trade union committee shall be established to be designated as the ""single central committee"";- Section 39(3), which authorises the Ministry of Labour, through the inspector of labour, to prescribe the terms of the collective agreement between workers and employers, a provision which is utterly at variance with the jurisprudential concept of the collective labour agreement;- Section 39(9), second paragraph, which provides that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court dealing with questions of collective bargaining is to be governed by regulations, decrees or administrative decisions concerning the determination of conditions of employment in the public sector;- Sections 53, 54 and 55, which raise from 15 to 30 the minimum number of workers necessary for the purpose of forming a trade union association. In the CEOSL's opinion, this increase in the minimum number of workers makes it all but impossible to exercise the right to establish trade union organisations, since in Ecuador the number of workers in most of the existing enterprises does not exceed 30;- Sections 65 and 68, which reduce the right to strike. Section 65 (solidarity strike) requires certain formalities to be satisfied, prescribes the time which must elapse between the declaration of a strike and the actual stoppage of work, and specifies a time-limit of three consecutive working days. By section 68 the time to elapse between the declaration and the commencement of the strike is increased (in institutions and enterprises performing services of social or public interest) from ten to 20 days, and this restriction is made applicable to large groups of workers in the private sector (enterprises distributing gas and other fuels, hotels, private banks, savings institutions, bodies providing credit for housing, financial institutions, cattle-raising, dairy-farming and other agricultural undertakings).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

In that context, the Government decided to appoint a number of commissions that were to make specific proposals for administrative and juridical reforms in the areas of labour questions, customs tariffs, foreign trade, farming, industrial and financial development, promotion of investments, etc. with a view to such integration. Representatives of the chambers of production and of the trade union organisations - including, naturally, the complainant Confederation of Workers of Ecuador - were invited to participate and to engage in a dialogue with the Government.

The Government explains that in the drafting of these amendments account was taken of the present need to modernise and bring up to date the Labour Code, which dates from 1938, in the light of today's socio-economic realities. Attention was also paid to the need to face the challenge of the economic integration which, as from 1 January 1992, brought into operation the customs union and, as from 1 July 1992, the Andean free trade area. The immediate object of the amendments is to facilitate and expedite the settlement of collective labour agreements and labour disputes, to stimulate investment and initiative by entrepreneurs in order to encourage the establishment of new enterprises and the expansion of existing ones thus diversifying commercial and industrial activity and generating new employment opportunities, to benefit the workers, to abolish obsolete and unfair rules and to rationalise the exercise of solidarity strikes and strikes in the public sector.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

The Government adds that the Act consists of 81 operative provisions and that many of them will mark important progress in the protection of the workers' interests, e.g. the improved guarantee of security of tenure, the establishment of a fairer scale of compensation for dismissal, the inclusion of two new bases for strike action, an increase in the length of maternity leave to 12 weeks, an increase in the fines to which employers are generally liable for non-compliance with rules that benefit the workers, etc. The Government states that the amendments are balanced and fair in that they rectify flawed procedures, facilitate and protect the right to submit petitions and grievances, and improve the personal protection of workers. In general terms, Act No. 133 ensures the opening up of fresh opportunities of employment and hence the creation of thousands of jobs for the country's unemployed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

In the case of section 39 of Act No. 133 the legislator considered it desirable that, by analogy with the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, a ""tripartite tribunal"" should be the body responsible for settling such disagreements. The section in question in fact provides for the addition of 13 clauses which lay down a regulated procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of collective agreements. For this purpose, various stages are prescribed, of which the first is direct bargaining between the parties. In the event of the total or partial failure of this stage, there begins the litigious procedure in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court which in turn comprises petition, counterclaim, hearing and ruling, the latter being enforceable. Furthermore, another clause of section 39 of Act No. 133 guarantees, for the first time and in express terms, security of tenure for permanent workers as from the time when these workers submit the draft collective agreement for discussion (prohibition of dismissal and of lay-off of workers for the duration of the procedures referred to in the chapter).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

Naturally, the period of duration of the collective agreement is likewise a result of the agreement between the contracting parties.

The Government adds that, owing to the dynamics of relations in the productive sector and to the constantly evolving nature of labour law, it became indispensable and urgent to adjust the rules in the labour law concerning the minimum number of workers necessary for the exercise of the right of association and unionisation, at a time when the country is moving ever faster in a subregional process of economic, customs and industrial integration. The Government points out that neither Convention No. 87 nor the Constitution of the Republic specify the number of workers necessary for establishing a workers' organisation. The amendment of the Labour Code introduced by Act No. 133 is far from impeding the right of unionisation - as the complainant organisations claim - and in fact, between the promulgation of the Act and 27 March 1992, 24 workers' organisations have been established.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

However, when an appeal for review and an appeal for voiding the award are lodged simultaneously, the Higher Tribunal will first adjudicate on the appeal for voiding the award. If this appeal is dismissed, it will then deal with the appeal for review. Section 475 of the Labour Code did not make provision for the ""de facto"" or ""supporting"" appeal; rather, in permitting the remedies of the civil procedure to be applied mutatis mutandis the conciliation and arbitration courts agreed to the lodging of such appeals, the collective labour dispute being settled in second and final instance. The practice in proceedings concerning labour questions had then shown that the ""de facto"" remedy was used by the parties, especially by the employers, to retard the settlement of the dispute as far as possible, to the detriment of the workers. The object of the amendment, which applies equally to workers and to employers in so far as they are parties to a litigation procedure, is to rectify defects in the application of the law, as mentioned earlier, which unduly delayed the settlement of collective labour disputes, and to ensure the efficacy and expeditious treatment of those remedies which are provided for in the Labour Code. Without any doubt, this change speeds up the proceedings and enables the parties to a collective labour dispute to use the procedural remedies provided for in the labour legislation, in the certain knowledge that these will be as effective as the defence of their interests demands.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

According to section 493 of the Labour Code, the right to strike, in order to be effective, implies the occupation of the workplace by the strikers. As a consequence of this guarantee, the strike, even if a solidarity strike, gives the right to those declaring it to occupy the premises of the enterprise for the duration of the actual action. Where operations are paralysed in this way, without any lawful reason other than that of solidarity, the legislator is amply justified in prescribing precisely the procedure and the time-limits which are to govern the occupation of the enterprise's plant on grounds of class solidarity. Ecuador's labour legislation protects and guarantees the workers' right to strike, both by provisions in the Constitution and by statute (article 31 of the Constitution and sections 463 to 511 of the Labour Code). The Government points out that the solidarity strike is a juridical institution provided for in the legislation of some countries, for the purpose of channelling the expressions of class solidarity in defence of the legitimate labour claims of workers involved in a dispute. Accordingly, such a strike has not per se any economic or social basis, but reflects only feelings of solidarity. Former section 498 of the Labour Code, now amended by section 64 of Act No. 133, recognised this right to the solidarity strike, but did not regulate its exercise; however, the practical operation of this guarantee highlighted the necessity of regulating the way in which the guarantee operates, so as not to frustrate its essential purpose of class solidarity, which is different from the dispute itself covered by the rules of the relevant paragraph in the Labour Code that deals with strikes. In this context, section 65 of Act No. 133 adds four provisions to section 498 which prescribe clearly and in detail the procedure to be followed for the exercise of this right; they specify, inter alia, that the solidarity strike may not last longer than three days, after the expiry of which maximum time-limit normal work must be resumed. The reason for this is that those striking in sympathy or solidarity are not in law connected with the main dispute with which they are showing their solidarity and hence are not procedurally parties to that dispute. The guarantee of security of tenure contained in section 496, which has not been amended, is provided for the benefit of the principal strikers, that is, the workers engaged in a collective dispute in the enterprise, on the termination of which they have a right to a special additional one-year's security of tenure. It should be emphasised that the altruistic motives of those striking in sympathy cannot be a reason for obtaining a special extraordinary security of tenure of the kind provided by the legislator for the benefit of those actually parties to the dispute at enterprise level, for in the course of that dispute the workers involved often risk their own financial stability and job security. It should be noted that the amendments introduced by section 65 of Act No. 133 do not deprive those striking in sympathy of whatever security they may have on other grounds.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

The Committee takes note of the Government's comments on these points, and in particular:- as regards compulsory arbitration in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, it was considered desirable that the body settling disagreements between the parties negotiating a collective agreement should be a tripartite tribunal; and- as regards the change in the number of workers necessary for the establishment of a trade union - the number being increased from 15 to 30 - that, in view of the dynamics of relations in the productive sector and of the labour law, it became indispensable and urgent to adjust the rules in the labour law concerning the number of workers necessary for this purpose, having regard to the fact that the country is engaged in a subregional process of economic, customs and industrial integration.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

Even though the minimum number of 30 workers would be acceptable in the case of sectoral trade unions, the Committee considers that the minimum number should be reduced in the case of works councils so as not to hinder the establishment of such bodies, particularly when it is taken into account that the country has a very large proportion of small enterprises and that the trade union structure is based on enterprise unions;""""The Committee also notes that the imposition of a compulsory arbitration procedure before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, if the parties do not reach agreement on a draft collective agreement, raises problems in relation to the application of the Convention (No. 98).""""The Committee once again urges the Government to take the necessary measures in the near future to bring the law and practice into full conformity with the Convention ... .""The present Committee, like the Committee of Experts, emphasises that the imposition of compulsory arbitration is contrary to the principles of freedom of association and hopes that the Government will take the action requested by the Committee of Experts as soon as possible.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902296, response status: 200"

The same rule provides that those participating in a solidarity strike will not enjoy the benefit of the guarantee of security of tenure under section 496 of the Labour Code. In these circumstances, while regretting that the legislation limits solidarity strikes to three days, a severe restriction on the rights of workers' organisations to formulate a programme of action, the Committee recalls that workers' organisations should be able to have recourse to those strikes which are in support of legal strikes. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to guarantee the job security of workers who participate in strikes of this nature. The Committee adds that the legislation in force does not recognise the right to strike of federations and confederations (it only recognises the works council's right to declare a strike under section 491 of the Labour Code) and that before the enactment of the amending Act No. 133 the trade union organisations were able lawfully to use the solidarity strike for carrying out strikes not only at enterprise level but also at higher (even provincial or nationwide) levels. In view of the implications, so far as strikes are concerned, of the amendments introduced by Act No. 133, the Committee requests the Government to take action with a view to the recognition, by law, of the federations' and confederations' right to strike.1009.Lastly, as regards section 68 of Act No. 133 (time-limit of the notice of the declaration of a strike in institutions and enterprises that perform services of ""social or public"" interest that exceed the notion of essential services in the strict sense of the term) and section 39(1), second paragraph (which provides that collective bargaining must be conducted at a specified territorial level, that at least 50 per cent of the workers must be represented and that an ad hoc negotiating committee - designated as the ""single central committee"" - must be established), the Committee notes that the Government's reply does not contain full comments.

Section 4 of this Decree states that: ""With a view to ensuring the democratic rotation of representativity, persons who have previously attended the International Labour Conference as Employers' delegates or advisers shall, as from the 78th Session of the Conference, be ineligible to serve again in the capacity of delegate or adviser in the Ecuadorian delegation"".

Subsequently, on 20 April 1990, the United Workers' Front, which comprises the CEOSL, the CTE and the CEDOCUT, duly informed the Government that the CEOSL would designate the Workers' delegate to the 1990 Session of the Conference, and expressed its opinion on how the system should be adapted to accommodate the fact that a fourth legally recognised workers' confederation had come into existence. On the same day, the CEOSL informed the Government that it would appoint its President, Jos茅 Ch谩vez, as the delegate. Some days later, on 25 May 1990, without prior notice or consultation and without giving any reason whatsoever, the Government promulgated Decree No. 1535 amending Decree No. 1381. Section 2 of the new Decree states that with a view to helping new trade union leaders to acquire international experience, and in order to further the training of Ecuadorian trade unionists, ""persons having attended the International Labour Conference as Workers' delegates or advisers would be ineligible to attend future sessions of the Conference in the same capacity, beginning with the Conference's 77th Session"". On 28 May 1990, the Government notified the four trade union confederations of the content of the Decree, thus underscoring the unilateral nature of the decision it had taken. The Government then requested the confederations to nominate their representatives in accordance with the new provisions by 31 May 1990.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036, response status: 200"

The ICFTU emphasises that up until 1990, the appointment of Workers' representatives had followed a system of rotation agreed to by the workers' confederations (Decree No. 1381 of 13 December 1982), following consultation with these confederations, noting that this system had functioned without any problems whatsoever.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036, response status: 200"

Case No 1544 (Ecuador),31-Jul-90,The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036'],"102.As regards Decree No. 1535 of 25 May 1990, the Government states that it is intended solely to reform the regulation in force concerning the election of Workers' delegates by establishing a general requirement that the delegate who shall represent the country's most representative organisations of workers may not have served as such at previous sessions of the International Labour Conference. Consequently, the power to designate delegates continues to be the exclusive province of the most representative organisations, and the Government has not modified this power. In fact, the names of those who made up the Ecuadorian delegation to the 1990 Session of the Conference as representing workers' organisations were submitted by the organisations concerned. Only those organisations which refused to reply to the Government's invitation failed to be included in the Ecuadorian delegation to the Conference's 77th Session. Specifically, the fact that the CEOSL and the CTE abstained from complying with the above-mentioned requirement does not in any way take away from the legitimacy of the nominations made in due course by the other two trade union confederations: the CEDOC and the CEDOCUT. Moreover, the Government expresses some surprise at the allegations, as it is public knowledge that the CEDOCUT, whose delegate participated in the deliberations of the 77th Session, has very close ties with the complainant organisation (the CEOSL), as reflected in their joint participation in the United Workers' Front (FUT). Thus, the Ecuadorian Government considers inaccurate and tendentious the assertion that there is only one representative organisation of workers in Ecuador, and that such organisation, the CEOSL, had been prevented from participating in the delegation to the 77th Session of the International Labour Conference.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036, response status: 200"

The Government encloses with its communication an invitation extended by the Minister of Labour to the four trade union confederations, requesting them to comment on possible reforms to Decree No. 1381, as well as the reply sent by the FUT, on behalf of CEOSL, CTE and CEDOCUT.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036, response status: 200"

The Government states that although certain trade union organisations refuse to accept the reasons set forth by the Government, these reasons are definitely designed to promote the interests of workers as a whole, and not of any individual in particular.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036, response status: 200"

The Government justifies this requirement on the basis of the principle of the ""alternation in democratic systems"", the acquisition of international experience by new trade union leaders and the further training of Ecuadorian trade union leaders.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036, response status: 200"

Its conclusions are as follows:The (Credentials) Committee noted that, according to the ICFTU objection, the CEOSL, which was the most important central organisation, had been deprived of the opportunity to nominate its representative, Mr. J. Ch谩vez, because of Decree No. 1535 of 25 May 1990. The Committee pointed out that the Decree in question had modified the rotation system, which had been freely agreed to several years ago and which had functionned to the satisfaction of the organisations concerned. In this respect, the Committee recalled that any rotation system should always be the result of agreement between the most representative organisations and must not be imposed by the Government.The Committee considered that the Decree, apart from violating article 3, paragraph 5, of the Constitution of the ILO, by impeding the free choice by the organisations of the persons who would represent them in Geneva, constituted an act of interference contrary to the principles of freedom of association.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2902036, response status: 200"

The Committee considers that Decrees Nos. 1535 and 1589 violate the principles of freedom of association, according to which employers' and workers' organisations have the right freely to elect their representatives (Articles 3 and 5 of Convention No. 87).

Finally, the Government explains that the enterprise decided to dismiss the majority of its workers to be able to comply with the aforementioned decisions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

It only requires that the employer compensate for the legal and economic repercussions of his decision to close.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

Furthermore, the Government communicates the contents of sections 188 and 189 of the Labour Code:Section 189 of the Labour Code regulates the case of dismissal without notice and stipulates that:An employer who dismisses an employee without due notice shall be required to pay him compensation corresponding to his length of service, at the following rates:- up to two years' service, the equivalent of two months' remuneration;- between two and five years' service, the equivalent of four months' remuneration;- between five and 20 years' service, the equivalent of six months' remuneration; and- over 20 years' service, the equivalent of 12 months' remuneration.The compensation shall be calculated on the basis of the remuneration that the employee was receiving at the time of his dismissal, without prejudice to the payments due in case of termination with notice ...Section 188, which contains guarantees for trade union officers, stipulates that:It shall not be lawful for the employer to dismiss without notice or give notice of termination to an employee who is a member of the managing committee of the employees' organisation. If he does so, he shall pay the employee compensation equal to the latter's remuneration for one year and shall not prevent the employee from continuing to be a member of the managing committee until expiry of the period for which he was elected.The protection afforded by this section shall cover the period during which the committee member acts as such and one year thereafter ...The amount of the above-mentioned compensation shall be divided equally between the employee and the organisation to which he belongs.If the employer fails to pay the above compensation for up to one month, the employee may demand payment through the courts of law; if judgement is given against the employer, he shall pay, in addition to the compensation, a further sum equal to half thereof, which shall be credited to the employee exclusively ...The foregoing shall not prevent the employer from terminating the contract for the reasons mentioned in section 171.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

Furthermore, as regards their return to work, section 496 of the Labour Code provides that except in the case of an unlawful strike, all workers shall return to their posts upon termination of the strike and that their employment shall be guaranteed for one year, during which time they may not be dismissed except for reasons specified in section 171. Section 496 also stipulates that this condition shall be deemed binding on the employer and regarded as part of the settlement or reward, even if not expressly mentioned.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

It nevertheless adds that the employer had to close one of its establishments for economic reasons, and that it took this opportunity of shutting down one of its establishments by paying the workers concerned a sum equivalent to the far-reaching compensation to be paid in the case of undue dismissals laid down in the collective agreement. The Government also explains generally that the employer may terminate a labour contract under section 171 of the Labour Code, if the worker is found guilty of grossly insulting behaviour towards the employer. However, the Government does not give any example in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

The first concerns the strike itself. The Committee notes that this strike was declared legal by the courts and that furthermore, in accordance with the legal rulings, the enterprise paid the days of the strike, but with a certain delay. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

According to the Government, these dismissals took place because an establishment, no longer profitable due to its dilapidated state, was closed down. Whilst noting the explanations provided by the Government, the Committee feels nevertheless bound to point out that these dismissals took place immediately after the strike. The link between these dismissals of workers - in particular, of trade union officials - and the strike cannot be dismissed a priori.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

It must also draw the Government's attention to the fact that the Workers' Representatives Recommendation, 1971 (No. 143), mentions, amongst the measures to be taken to ensure effective protection to these workers, that recognition of a priority should be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce (article 6(2)(f)). The Committee also considered that it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. 98, is accorded by legislation which enables employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities (see Digest of decisions, para. 547).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

Consequently, the Committee recalls that complaints against acts of anti-union discrimination should normally be examined by national machinery which, in addition to being speedy, should not only be impartial but also be seen to be such by the parties concerned, who should participate in the procedure in an appropriate and constructive manner (see Digest of decisions, para. 570).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

Nevertheless, taking into account the principles recalled above and also the provision in the national legislation which stipulates that workers, in the case of a lawful strike, shall be guaranteed their employment for one year, during which time they may not be dismissed except for reasons specified in section 171 of the Labour Code, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation of the five trade union officials dismissed in this case and to point out in particular whether their case has been brought before the courts and, if so, to provide the texts of the judgements.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901846, response status: 200"

The versions put forward by the complainant organisation and the Government on the matter are contradictory.

According to the Government, on the other hand, the said association, not being a trade union organisation but a non-profit making body subject to civil law, was indeed taken over by the authorities because it was suspected of irregularities in management, abuse of social property and diversion of subsidies coming from foreign foundations, particularly one in the Federal Republic of Germany, for the benefit of a political party.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901595, response status: 200"

As part of these measures, it was necessary to raise the price of petrol to the equivalent of 46 American cents or 75 Swiss centimes per gallon (4 litres), i.e. 11 American cents or 18 Swiss centimes per litre. Furthermore, it was vital to release foreign currency and float the bank interest rate, because the State was incapable of continuing to subsidise exchange rates and the fixed interest rate.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901571, response status: 200"

Mr. Fausto Dut谩n, substitute member of the National Congress, representing the Broad Left Front (FADI), took over the presidency of the Workers' Unitarian Front (FUT) and announced the list of claims of the forthcoming strike which advocated: i)there should be no payment of the foreign debt; (ii) the oil industry should be nationalised; (iii) primary commodities should only be marketed by ENAC and ENPROVIT (state marketing enterprises) in order to maintain a price balance; (iv) land should be handed over to the peasants.

It may only be declared in the following cases: ""(1) if the employer, after being notified of the employees' demands, fails to reply within the statutory time or gives a negative reply; (2) if the employer, after being notified, dismisses or gives notice of dismissal to one or more employees, or gives notice of the termination of an agreement ..."", except ""in the case of the dismissal of an employee who has committed an act of violence against the property of the undertaking or factory or against the person of the employer or his agent; (3) if no conciliation and arbitration tribunal is appointed within the time specified in section 466 or if, having been appointed, the tribunal for any reason does not meet within three days of its appointment, on condition in either case that the failure is not the fault of the members designated by the employees; (4) if conciliation proves impossible or no award is issued within the time allowed by section 473"". Strikes are only guaranteed by the Constitution and the Labour Code subject to these conditions. However, this concept of strike action is so wide that it authorises strikers to remain in the factories, workshops or workplaces concerned (unique in world labour legislation), under police protection against the entry of agitators and strike breakers; it entitles strikers to receive remuneration and authorises solidarity strikes: ""The law also recognises the right to strike where the object is to support a lawful strike declared by the employees of another undertaking."" A lawful general strike might arise because employees in one undertaking support a strike in another undertaking, which is being conducted in accordance with the law, and this spreads to all undertakings throughout the country.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901571, response status: 200"

These same political leaders head trade union confederations grouped together in the Workers' Unitarian Front, whilst also participating in the Ecuadorian Revolutionary Youth Movement, the Workers' Revolutionary Movement, the General Union of Workers or the Popular Front. Similarly, they collaborate with these real or fictitious organisations, with the FEUE and the UNE and various clandestine groups who are openly committed to violence. These persons, in interpreting freedom of association in their own way, prevented the free movement of vehicles and pedestrians and normal activities within the city by raising obstacles and barricades in the streets, destroying traffic signs, public clocks and rubbish bins and tearing up the paving on the streets.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901571, response status: 200"

In the capital city, the strikers killed hundreds of dogs, scorching them in the fire and then hanging them from the branches of trees and on lamp-posts. At the end of the day of 25 March, the strikers declared that the ""tenth general strike"" organised by the FUT had been ""victorious"". Several FUT officials tried, later, to deny their responsibility for the shameful actions of 25 March and put the blame on ""maladjusted elements""; some even accused the Government itself.

Fifteen trade unionists were arrested on that day, including Julio Chang Crespo, Secretary-General of the CEOSL and member of the Executive Committee of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (ORIT), a regional organisation belonging to the ICFTU.

The CEOSL explains in this document that the Government has carried out a policy aimed at giving a boost to exporters of agricultural products, banks and large undertakings at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises, resulting in the worsening of the social and economic situation of the majority of the population. This policy has brought about, for instance, price increases in stable commodities, public services (transport, electricity, water and telephones) and medicines, the freezing of budgetary expenditure for education and an increase in unemployment and underemployment.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

For example, it refuses to register trade union executives which have been democratically and legally elected and to approve the rules of new organisations by laying down administrative requirements not stipulated by law. The CEOSL quotes the case of several trade unions who have been confronted with such difficulties (the Ecuadorian Railway Workers Union, the Works' Council of Cubiertas and Mzov S.A., the Federation of Free Workers in the Ecuadorian Sugar Sector, the Santa Elena Agricultural Workers' Trade Union).","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

The instigators and authors of such stoppages are liable to a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 sucres and to two- to five-years' imprisonment; those taking part in the work stoppage are liable to a fine of 200 to 1,000 sucres and to three-months' to one-year's imprisonment.

Admittedly, like many developing countries, Ecuador is undergoing a crisis, but the Government is attempting to ensure that the nation overcomes it unscathed and with the least social and political consequences. It is incumbent upon the public authorities to guarantee peace in the country and uphold national law and order.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

It widely respects trade union rights and guarantees the exercise of these rights provided that this is lawful and moral and does not infringe legislation or disrupt law and order. The ""general strike"" of 17 September, wrongly described as ""peaceful"", was neither of a social nor trade union nature but was a seditious act: groups of rioters set up barricades in the streets and on the highways, caused fires, attacked members of the police force and private and official vehicles, damaged private property and injured individuals. The Government was prudent in the way it controlled the situation. Only several people actually instigating the disturbances or involved in violent action were arrested after being caught in the act. These agitators, who were imprisoned, were immediately released once the disturbances had ended and after serving a very short sentence of two-days' imprisonment, in accordance with the penalties for offences laid down in the Penal Code. The only reason behind all the international proceedings was therefore to prolong a meticulously organised scandal and to exaggerate the importance of incidents brought rapidly brought under control. According to the Government, even an opposition paper described the general strike as being political. Furthermore, the Government points out that the so-called ""evidence"" of the ""repression"" carried out by the Government consists of cuttings from this same opposition paper.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

It believes that sovereignty is absolute, indivisible, inalienable and imprescriptable.

Amongst those ultimate goals necessary to the State is the legal goal. Referring to various authors, the Goverment declares that the State cannot give up its role of guarantor and enforcer of national law and order and the national judicial system, without relinquishing its very existence. If the State's judicial raison d'锚tre ceased to exist, so would its social objectives and the ""upholding of man's natural and imprescriptable rights"".

It points out that offences which resulted in the pulverisation of a considerable number of policemen's helmets, in the smashing of dozens of windscreens, in the hospitalisation of countless policemen and police officers, in the destruction of police property and cars might have been penalised quite differently: six-months' to three-years' imprisonment (section 131 of the Penal Code: for conspiracy to overthrow the Government, or section 132, for incitement to break the law); one- to five-years' imprisonment (section 135: for the disruption of peace amongst citizens by providing arms or encouraging them to arm themselves against each other); six-months' to two-years' imprisonment and a fine of 500 to 1,000 sucres (section 148: for the distribution by any means or disseminating abroad of propaganda or false news or information which aims at disrupting law and order or casts a doubt upon national honour); three-months' to two-years' imprisonment and a fine of 200 to 1,000 sucres (section 151: for the introduction into the country of any money or securities to be used for subversive purposes or to disrupt law and order); one- to three-months' imprisonment and a fine of 100 to 300 sucres (section 153: for the promotion, organisation or leadership of public marches or demonstrations in the street, squares or other public places without written authorisation from the competent authority); eight- to 12-years' imprisonment (section 158: for actions resulting in the destruction, damaging, disuse, interruption or paralysis of public services or industrial plants with a view to alarming the population; 12 to 16-years' imprisonment (section 158, paragraph 2: for injury caused to individuals as a result of the above-mentioned actions).

As regards the Ecuadorian Railway Workers' Union, the Government explains that this case involved a review of the rules which contravened the law, in accordance with section 442 of the Labour Code. The trade union, after being notified of the refusal on 10 July 1986, submitted a new draft which was accepted by the Minister of Labour and Human Resources on 31 July 1986. On the same day, the amended rules were registered with the Department of Occupational Organisations and Statistics under the General Labour Directorate. This proves that the legitimate demands of trade union organisations are given preferential treatment since the registration formalities were carried out in one day, whereas the Labour Code provides for a time period of 30 days.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

The right to call a solidarity strike is recognised whenever its object is to support lawful strikes declared within the same province or branch of activity.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

During the demonstrations held on the day of the strike, several trade union officials were arrested and then sentenced to two-days' imprisonment. The Government declares that these penalties were justified because of the violence committed during these unauthorised demonstrations and emphasises the political and seditious nature of the strike. Furthermore, the complainant describes difficulties encountered by several trade union organisations in registering their rules or amendments to their rules and the adoption of Decree No. 2205 regulating sympathy strikes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

(See, for example, 243rd Report, Case No. 1296 (Antigua and Barbuda), para. 276.) However, although the right to strike is one of the basic rights of workers and their organisations, this is so only in so far as it constitutes a means to defend their economic and social interests: the prohibition of strikes designed to coerce a government, if they are non-occupational in character, does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association (see, for example, 127th Report, Case No. 60 (Mauritania), para. 303), and strikes of a purely political nature do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, 153rd Report, Cases Nos. 763, 786 and 801 (Uruguay), para. 177.) The Committee has stressed that the concept of economic and social interests should not only imply obtaining better working conditions or ensuring appliance with claims of an occupational nature, but should also include seeking solutions to economic and social policy questions which are of direct concern to the workers. (See, for example, 214th Report, Case No. 1081 (Peru), para. 261.)","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

It has ascertained that these mainly comprised requests for an increase in the minimum wage, for the respect of collective agreements in force and for a change in economic policy (price increases and unemployment), all matters which are within the normal field of activity of trade union organisations. The Committee therefore considers that the strike on 17 September 1986 was legitimate and should not have been banned.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that, in the present case, the Government publicly declared, even before the 24- hour general strike had begun, that this Decree was still fully in force, contrary to the information provided in 1982 to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations that it had fallen into disuse. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the Committee of Experts has been requesting the Government for several years to repeal this Decree and that, until now, there has been no favourable follow-up to its comments.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that, in one of the four cases cited by the complainant, the trade union amended its draft rules to comply with the request from the Ministry of Labour, which immediately registered it, and that, in the three other cases, the organisations concerned did not respond to the Ministry of Labour's refusals which set out the reasons for their non-acceptance. In this respect, the Committee notes from the 1983 observation made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations on the application of Convention No. 87 by Ecuador that, in the case of a refusal by the Ministry of Labour, appeal is possible to the courts under sections 1, 2, 5 and 10 a)of the Administrative Tribunal Act and that the Administrative Tribunal can examine the substance of the matter. In the present case, the organisations concerned apparently failed to make use of the judicial possibilities open to them in the case of a refusal. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

In its 1983 General Survey, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations considered that a general prohibition of solidarity strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful. (See International Labour Conference, 69th Session, 1983, Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, para. 217.)","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

In the Committee's opinion, although several provisions contained in the Decree might be justified by the need to respect various procedures (notification of the strike to the labour authorities) or to guarantee security within the undertaking (the prevention of agitators and strike-breakers from entering the workplace), others, however, such as geographical or sectoral restrictions placed on solidarity strikes - which therefore exclude general strikes of this nature - or restrictions on their duration and frequency, constitute a serious obstacle to the calling of such strikes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901533, response status: 200"

Only manual workers involved in the construction and maintenance of lines are covered by the Labour Code. The Act on the Civil Service and Administrative Careers - which is the relevant legislation - prohibits public employees from forming trade unions. The Supreme Court had already in 1982 decided that, since IETEL was a body carrying out a public service, its employees were covered by the Act on the Civil Service and Administrative Careers.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901463, response status: 200"

This refusal was based on the fact that the organisation's members are employed by a body set up by law to carry out a public service and which comes under the Act on the Civil Service and Administrative Careers in its relations with employees. Moreover, under section 22 of the Telecommunications Act, the employees of IETEL are deemed to be public servants, except those manual workers who are covered by the Labour Code.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901463, response status: 200"

They can only form associations (section 9 of that Act) which may further and defend the interests of their members, but which do not have the right to strike or the right to bargain collectively. This prohibition on creating trade unions, applicable to all public servants, has been commented on by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901463, response status: 200"

The Committee must therefore examine whether these workers are guaranteed the principle set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98, namely that measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation of collective agreements. Article 6 of the Convention allows the exclusion of ""public servants"". However, the Committee of Experts has considered that, while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of persons who are employed by the State or in the public sector, but who do not act as agents of the public authority is contrary to the meaning of the Convention; the Committee also has considered that this is made even clearer in the English text of Article 6 of the Convention, which permits the exclusion solely of public servants ""engaged in the administration of the State"". The Committee could not admit the exclusion from the terms of the Convention of important categories of workers employed by the State merely on the grounds that they are formally assimilated to certain categories of public officials engaged in the administration of the State. If this were the case, the Convention might be deprived of much of its scope. The distinction therefore must be drawn between, on the one hand, public servants who by their functions are directly engaged in the administration of the State - that is, civil servants employed in government ministries and other comparable bodies, as well as officials acting as supporting elements in these activities - and, on the other hand, other persons employed by the government, by public undertakings or by autonomous public institutions. Only the former category can be excluded from the scope of the Convention.

According to the WFTU, the intervention by government forces left eight people dead, dozens of injured and over 300 of the 300,000 demonstrators detained.

The WFTU expresses alarm at the Government's action all the more so since the demonstration concerned the deterioration of living and working conditions in the country.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901378, response status: 200"

It alleges that the Government reacted violently and this resulted in the death of 15 workers, dozens of injured and the imprisonment of hundreds of persons. According to the ICFTU, the premises of the CEOSL were broken into by the police.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901378, response status: 200"

It points out that, by virtue of Act No. 107 of 4 November 1982, salaried workers receive an automatically adjusted transport subsidy and that, accordingly, the workers were not affected by the increases as regards their movement to and from the workplace. According to the Government, at the same time, it announced the immediate introduction in the legislature of several bills of a social nature which included proposed subsidies to compensate for the increase in the cost of living; in addition, the National Congress was discussing a law to fix a new minimum wage and a general increase in salaries and wages.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901378, response status: 200"

The Government states that it informed the public of the illegality of the work stoppage and of the risk that workers who arbitrarily occupied the workplaces might be considered as committing serious acts of misconduct possibly leading to requests from the authorities to terminate the employment relationship. Nevertheless, the Government also made it clear that, with a view to avoiding damage, it would not eject workers who occupied factories. The Government states that its balanced and moderate attitude was heeded by the vast majority of workers who reported normally for work. According to inquiries carried out in Quito, about 85 per cent of the undertakings continued to function normally, and the situation was similar throughout the country.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901378, response status: 200"

Faced with this and with a view to preserving law and order, the Government called for police intervention which remained within the limits of recommended prudence, avoiding the use of firearms and only resorting to tear-gas bombs and high-pressure water hoses. According to the Government, owing to the cautious behaviour of the police, the damage caused by the violent demonstrations was reduced to a minimum.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2901378, response status: 200"

The Government maintains that the number of wounded persons was vastly less than that alleged by the complainants and that most of them suffered the after-effects of tear-gas. According to police sources, the number of persons held after the disturbances was not in the hundreds and no one was detained for more than 48 hours.

It regrets that there were indirect victims and states that after the event it announced publicly its willingness to dialogue with the trade union leadership so as to solve the problems affecting both the workers and the other sectors of the community.

The Committee observes that, according to the Government, no one was detained for more than 48 hours and there have been no dismissals or persecution of workers who took part in the work stoppage. In this connection the Committee feels bound to recall that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations - in the framework of its examination of Ecuador's observance of Convention No. 87 - has for many years been commenting on the legislation concerning strikes; in particular it has called for the repeal of the penalty of imprisonment laid down in Legislative Decree No. 105 for the instigators of collective work stoppages. It would, accordingly, draw the Government's attention to the principle that strike action in defence of the workers' social and economic interests is one of the means of action which should be available to workers' organisations and that any intervention by the police or armed forces should be limited strictly to the maintenance of law and order.

The Government submitted the documentation on the measures, undertaken by the Ministry of the Government concerning the case, as well as the reports drawn up by the competent authorities, including a report from the Under-Secretary of the Government; some of the most significant paragraphs in this report follow here below:""There is a dispute between the owner of the estate, Mr. Salvador Santos, and the peasant members of the 'Culluctuc San Jacinto de Yaguachi Community' which, according to the peasants and their lawyer, arose because the owner had forbidden them to use part of the wasteland to graze their animals; the peasants were under the impression that not only had they right of possession over this land but that this right was also recognised by a title deed. Dr. Jorge Pinto, Regional Director of the IERAC, acknowledged that there was indeed a dispute and stated that his administration had received several complaints both from the owner and from the peasants. As this dispute had grown more serious, the owner offered the peasants 100 hectares of land or individual lots.On Thursday 16 June, the day preceding these regrettable incidents, the IERAC carried out an inspection of the land offered by the owner. Mr. Santos was not present at the inspection but was represented by his sons. Several hundreds of peasants were there during the inspection and, according to the report, no problems arose.During the night of the 16th, states Mr. Luis Garcia, Steward of the estate, some 150 peasants attacked his house, neighbouring the owner's house, breaking down the door, hitting him and taking away the sum of 3,000 sucres and a shotgun.This same night, Mr. Salvador Santos declares that he went to the police headquarters at Riobamba to report this incident, demanding that the police forces should intervene. He was told that the matter would be dealt with on the following day.Indeed, early in the morning of Friday 17 June, Mr. Santos lodged a verbal complaint of assault and breach of domicile on the estate. Police Colonel Jos茅 Ricardo Espinoza Oleas ordered Lieutenant Leoncio Asc谩zubi, together with Sergeant Jos茅 Bola帽os and Police Constables Pedro Pilco and Hugo Vallejo, to go to the Culluctuc estate; they left, accompanied by Mr. Salvador Santos and his sons, at approximately 9 a.m.In Lieutenant Asc谩zubis police report, Lieutenant Asc谩zubi, Sergeant Jos茅 Bolaflos and Police Constable Pedro Pilco each gave an account of the facts which differed very little. In other words, they proceeded to the estate without encountering any difficulties,' passed in front of the Community Hall, situated 500 meters from the owner's house, remarked nothing in particular and arrived on the spot at approximately 10.]5 a.m., where several peasants were grazing their sheep. Upon entering the house of the steward, whom they found lying in bed, they noted that the front door had been broken in and that Luis Garcia had been beaten; these facts had occurred during the previous night. It took nearly quarter of an hour to note and write' down these observations. When they wished to leave the house and return (most probably to the city of Riobamba), they realised that about 600 peasants had gathered and they preferred to go into one of the rooms in the owner's house; according to the police report, most of the peasants were 'in an advanced state of inebriation and extremely aggressive, armed with clubs, spikes, whips and pick axes; faced with this situation, we tried to push them away, but they took advantage of this opportunity to attack us and snatch our weapons, taking with them our rifles, tear gas, helmets and coats; we also noticed that they had dragged the Police Constable Hugo Vallejo away with them; a few seconds later, we heard several gunshots, which made us believe that they had killed Vallejo; indeed, the Indians were in possession of the weapons they had snatched from us in the house and we could not even approach the windows because of the stones and sticks they were hurling at us, whilst also screaming abuse'. This police account would seem to infer that the peasants had broken down the door of the room in which they had taken refuge, seized all the weapons and managed to drag the police constable outside; the other police officers were inside the room when they heard the gunshots and thought that they had fired on Vallejo. We are adding this note, which is a summary of the account recorded on tape, because of the importance of these particular incidents and, above all, because of the conflicting accounts and documents. Lieutenant Asc谩zubi, Sergeant Jos茅 Bola帽os and Police Constable Pedro Pilco go on to say that they remained imprisoned until 2.30 p.m., at which time Major Antonio Vel谩stegni armed with a detachment released them. Upon leaving the house, they saw that Constable Vallejo, although his uniform was torn and he was completely covered in blood, was still alive and several of his colleagues carried him to the police vehicle. When they returned to Riobamba, they were informed about the death of the two peasants. In Major Vel谩stegui's police report, he points out that the peasants, upon his request, had returned all the weapons, except for the loader of a rifle and a revolver.There are several versions of these incidents. The leaders of the FETEIC and Dr. Guillermo Falcon谩, the peasants' lawyer, give this account: a little before 10 a.m., Mr. Santos, owner of the estate, drove by in a vehicle accompanied by his sons and four policemen; he stopped in front of the Community Hall, situated less than 1 km from the main house on the estate and informed the members of the Community who were there. ""I have come with the police today and I shall kill all those of you, including your animals, I find on my land""; he then continued on his way as far as the estate, where he got out of the car with his sons Alberto and Jaime; accompanied by his employees Manual Azacate and Luis Garcia and the four policemen, he started to insult and attack the peasants who were at that moment passing with their animals on the track which leads from the Culluctuc estate to the wasteland ""wounding Maria Chilliquinga, Jos茅 Chilliquinga and Susana Yumbillo and fatally shooting Felipa Fuchs and Pedro Cuji;. it should be pointed out that both the aggressors and policemen were armed and completely inebriated"". This version is upheld by the persons mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph and contained in the complaint made by Jos茅 Chilliquinga, President of the San Jacinto de Culluctuc Community to Carlos Carpio, Police Superintendent at Chimborazo.Mr. Salvador Santos, owner of the estate, states that he passed in front of the Community Hall together with Lieutenant Asc谩zubi and that they did not notice anything in particular; upon arriving at the house on the estate, they entered the house of the steward, Luis Garcia, and found him in bed. After about 10 minutes, they noted that many peasants had gathered together but the latter did not approach any further than the courtyard. He and his sons entered the house and heard several gunshots, after which the policemen came crawling into the room; one of the policemen was missing (most probably Hugo Vallejo) who had been forcefully dragged away by the peasants.

According to the trade union organisations this attack caused the death of around 100 people (workers and close relatives who were on the spot) and injuries to many others. The official number of dead acknowledged by the Government was 24. The people in question were drowned while attempting to cross an irrigation canal in their efforts to avoid the bullets and tear bombs. In addition, the complainants stated that many people had been killed by bullets. According to the Federation of Coastal Agricultural Workers, the exact number of deaths could not be established since, during the night, 50 bodies had been removed by the police and thrown into the boilers in the refinery. Furthermore, many persons had disappeared. Immediately following these events, the trade union leaders of the refinery were arrested or prosecuted. Of the persons arrested the complainants named the following: Brunmel Reyes, refinery workers' adviser, Santiago Espinoza, President of the FETLA, Cesareo Valverde Flores, General Secretary of the Provincial Federation of the Workers of Guayas (FPTG-CTE), whose life was in danger owing to the grave state of his health, and Julio Chang Crespo, President of the Federation of Free Workers of Guayas. Warrants had also been issued for the arrest of the members of the Unitary Committee of the three trade union centrals of the province. At Quito, Jos茅 Ch谩vez, President of the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CEOSL), had also been arrested. The Permanent Unitary Committee of Guayas stated that these persons were being held without trial.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900093, response status: 200"

It explained that the collective agreements in force in the Ecuadorian sugar industry prior to 18 August 1977 stipulated that in the event of an increase in the selling price of this foodstuff, the workers would be entitled to a percentage of this increase in the form of an addition to their wages. At its session on 16 August 1977, the Cabinet decided to raise the price of sugar on the home market by more than 54 per cent. On 18 August a joint agreement of the Ministers of industry, Commerce, Integration, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry confirmed the Government decision, specifying that ""the difference between the current and the previous prices of sugar would not be allotted to an increase in the workers' wages"". In protest against this decision which, according to the ICFTU, infringed the provisions contained in their collective agreements, the workers of the AZTRA refinery occupied the plant in question.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900093, response status: 200"

According to a press cutting forwarded by the WFTU and communicated to the Government, the workers on this farm had been on strike for three months.

It enclosed with its communication two press cuttings containing statements made by the Under-Secretary of State for Labour regarding this case. The Under-Secretary's statements showed that a statement of claims had been submitted on 20 September to the Inspector of Labour at Ca帽ar. The employer's reply was received on 4 October. On 11 October the Inspector of Labour asked the employer to submit the two draft agreements mentioned in his reply. Moreover, the Ministry of Labour, in its capacity as arbitrator, summoned the two parties for mediation on 20 October, to which the latter signified their agreement on 17 October. Nevertheless, the following day (18 October) the trade union leaders and members of the works Committee occupied the plant, chained and padlocked the doors and forced the seasonal workers to stop work. A document was then presented to the Labour Inspectorate in which it was stated that since the Tribunal had not given a decision within the time laid down by law, a strike had been called. Thus, continued the Under-Secretary of State, the strike was called after the premises had been occupied. It was also recalled that section 473 of the Labour Code obliged workers employed in the production, sale or distribution of essential foodstuffs to give notification of the work stoppage ten days in advance.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900093, response status: 200"

The latter then addressed a communication to the police authorities. Before intervening, the police called for the evacuation of the undertaking, the request being transmitted personally and directly by police officers. The latter were hoping to talk with the trade union leaders but these failed to appear. The most hot-headed workers indicated over the loudspeaker that they would not obey the orders of the police. A good many of the workers had already evacuated the area when the instigators of the strike appeared carrying sticks and arms thus preventing more than 900 men from leaving. When they attempted also to attack the sugar reserves the police were obliged to throw tear gas bombs. There was a rush towards the exit and in the resulting total confusion many workers fell into the irrigation canal surrounding the plant.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900093, response status: 200"

The legislation provides that demands of this type are filed away, which was done in the present case. The workers' leaders occupied the farm and called an indefinite strike, disregarding the law. The labour authorities declared this strike illegal in accordance with Decree No. 1475, dated 26 May 1977, and Decree No. 105, dated 3 June 1977. The employer submitted a request for the agreement of the labour authorities to his dismissing the workers on the grounds of repeated and unjustified offences and their failure to work for a period of more than three days. This request was examined by the authorities. The employer also requested the intervention of the police with a view to safeguarding private property.

In the Government's view these strikes were illegal because, in the case of the AZTRA undertaking, the notice required by the legislation had not been given and, in the case of the San Rafa毛l farm, the demands were aimed at the revision of a collective agreement in force. In addition, the strikes in question had been accompanied by the occupation of the premises.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900093, response status: 200"

The Committee notes the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for Labour describing the events that occurred at this refinery. It appears that the description given by him conflicts widely with the statements of the complainants as to the type of action taken by the police, the number of dead, the fact that persons were injured and the cause of death. On this last point, the complainants state that some people were killed by bullets and others were drowned while fleeing from the forces of law and order. According to the Government, the deaths were caused by drowning in the midst of total confusion. Moreover, the Government gives no details about the police intervention at the San Rafa毛l farm whereas the complainants indicated that the workers assembled in the undertaking had been attacked by an armed group composed partly of members of the rural police.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900093, response status: 200"

Judging from the information available it does not appear that the attitude of the workers in the undertaking surrounded by the police was such as would have justified an intervention of the forces of law and order of such a type as to cause a heavy loss of human life. As regards the AZTRA undertaking, the Committee notes moreover that, two months following these events, an agreement was signed which appears to have met the demands submitted by the workers, the rejection of which had caused the strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900093, response status: 200"

Some of the demands included in the statement had been submitted to the management more than two years previously. No response was made by the general management which furthermore called a halt to the dialogue with the workers' representatives. The National Council of the FENETEL then decided to ask the Government openly to terminate the general manager's term of office. Shortly thereafter, the national leaders of the FENETEL were transferred to different parts of the country with a view, according to them, to depriving the federation of its leadership. The leaders affected by this action complied with the management's orders. Nevertheless, some days later they received notification-of their dismissal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900074, response status: 200"

According to the Government, this decision was contrary to the principles governing relations between the State and its employees and was designed not only to instigate strike action but also to create a state of chaos. The Government stated that the legislation respecting the public service prohibited strike action by public servants in order that national life might not be brought to a standstill. This legislation applied to the employees of the Ecuadorian Telecommunications Institute since they were state employees.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900074, response status: 200"

This resolution also mentions the participation of the FENETEL in the general strike of 18 May 1977. It would appear, therefore, that the grounds for the dismissals were, in particular, the preparations made for a strike affecting only the Ecuadorian Telecommunications Institute, on the one hand, and participation in the 24-hour general strike called by the national Confederations, on the other. The participation of the FENETEL in the general strike seems to be established. Indeed, it can be seen from a perusal of various newspaper articles' that the National Council of the FENETEL had decided to support the strike in question. On the other hand, the FENETEL denies having organised a specific work stoppage such as is mentioned in the dismissal resolution. It states that, aware of its responsibilities as part of a public service which is essential for the development of the nation, it did not call a national strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900074, response status: 200"

On that occasion it considered that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express any dissatisfaction they may feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their interests, so long as such action consists merely in the expression of a protest and is not intended as a breach of the peace. In the case in question, there was a 24-hour strike. The Committee observes, in addition, that the dismissals were carried out more than two months after the FENETEL had participated in that strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900074, response status: 200"

Under an emergency procedure, these work stoppages led to the sentencing to fines and imprisonment of trade union officials, including Juan Vasquez Bastidas, President of the CTE, and Manuel Ant贸n, President of the UNE, to the outlawing of the UNE and to the dismissal of a very large number of teachers.

As concerns the teachers, the Government explained that the UNE's membership embraced a substantial proportion of the teachers in the country's public education system. These teachers had decided to call a national work stoppage with a view to obtaining certain pecuniary advantages which the Government was not in a position to offer them. Nevertheless, continued the Government, the authorities had studied these demands in a desire to satisfy them as far as possible. Notwithstanding this, on the initiative of a few of its leaders, the UNE had launched itself into a national strike which had brought public schools and colleges throughout the country to a standstill for 30 days with the sole aim o鈧?creating chaos, disrupting public order and attempting to shatter the peace and tranquillity of the Ecuadorian people. The Government had accordingly declared these events to be unlawful. The teaching profession is in fact governed by the Advancement and Wages Act, which enumerates the rights and duties which bind teachers to the State and prohibits strikes, work stoppages and other demonstrations of a political nature.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900069, response status: 200"

However, it had immediately quashed these sanctions and reinstated 95 per cent of the teachers in their profession, in some cases in the same post. The competent authorities were moreover examining the cases of the remainder with a view to their reinstatement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900069, response status: 200"

It, however, drew the latter's attention to a certain number of considerations and principles. For example, the recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. The Committee has admitted that this right may be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service. However, such measures should be accompanied by adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and, in the final instance, by arbitration procedures in which the awards are binding in all cases upon both parties and are promptly and fully implemented. Moreover, the outlawing of the UNE in pursuance of a decree was in flagrant breach of Article 4 of Convention No. 87, which had been ratified by Ecuador. Dissolution by the executive branch Of the Government pursuant to a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not afford the right of defence and does not offer the necessary guarantees. In other words, trade unions should enjoy the protection of a normal judicial procedure where the national legislation provides for the dissolution (or suspension) of a trade union as a punishment for a serious breach of the law. Furthermore, the outlawing of the UNE was liable to deprive teachers in the public education sector of any representative organisation, since its membership embraced a substantial proportion of the teachers concerned. The Governing Body requested the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE and to supply information on any development in this connection.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900069, response status: 200"

The first of these decrees punishes very severely and in very broad terms collective stoppages of work. The Committee expressed the opinion that it should be reviewed. The second, adopted only a few days after the strike of 18 May 1977, entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to minor breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal.

The second, adopted only a few days after the strike in question, entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to minor breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal. The Committee expressed the view that this summary procedure lent itself to abuse, and that all arrested trade unionists should be subject to normal judicial procedure guaranteeing the rights of defence and conforming to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900068, response status: 200"

The Governing Body also suggested to the Government the possibility of reconsidering the position of Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton.

It alleged that the Government had immediately reacted by applying Decrees Nos. 1475 and 1476, with the result that the UNE was dissolved and its national and regional leaders were jailed. They were sentenced to fines of from 2,000 to 8,000 sucres (80 to 350 United States dollars) and struck off the register of teachers forthwith, along with 500 of their colleagues. In a letter dated 4 November 1977, primarily concerned with another aspect of the trade union situation in Ecuador, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions mentioned these two decrees, which had, inter alia, resulted in the outlawing of the UNE (Decree No. 1476) and facilitated individual and ,collective dismissals, and the threatening, arrest or even murder of trade unionists.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900068, response status: 200"

Contrary to the most elementary principles governing relations between the State and its servants, these teachers decided to call a national work stoppage with a view to obtaining certain pecuniary advantages which the Government was not in a position to offer them. Nevertheless, continues the Government, the authorities studied these demands in a desire to satisfy them as far as possible. Notwithstanding this, on the initiative of a few of its leaders, the UNE launched itself into a national strike which brought public schools and colleges throughout the country to a standstill for 30 days with the sole aim of creating chaos, disrupting public order and attempting to shatter the peace and tranquillity of the Ecuadorian people.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900068, response status: 200"

Moreover, the authorities reached the conclusion after several meetings with the leaders that this was merely a campaign to enlist sympathy for a few teachers who were bad servants of the State. The Government, accordingly, declares these events to be unlawful and tendentious under the terms of the law. The teaching profession is in fact governed by the Advancement and Wages Act, which enumerates the rights and duties which bind teachers to the State and prohibits strikes, work stoppages and other demonstrations of a political nature. Teachers are public servants and may not infringe the provisions of the law. They are protected by laws which are different from the national labour legislation. Consequently, the Government does not consider that it has infringed Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, which apply to workers covered by the Labour Code and not to public servants, such as teachers, who have a public and social function to perform - in this instance, the education of the country's children and adolescents. The Government adds that in pursuance of the aforementioned Legislative Decree No. 105, it punished the ringleaders by dismissing them or transferring them to other provinces. However, it immediately quashed these sanctions and reinstated 95 per cent of the teachers in their profession, in some cases in the same post. The competent authorities are examining the cases of the remainder with a view to their reinstatement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900068, response status: 200"

It wishes, first of all, to recall that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No. 87 apply to all workers, ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the 'State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category should be permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900068, response status: 200"

The Committee has admitted that this right could be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service. However, as the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases involving teachers in the public educational system, such measures should be accompanied by adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and, in the final instance, arbitration procedures in which the awards would be binding in all cases upon both parties and would be promptly and fully implemented.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900068, response status: 200"

In this connection, Article 4 of Convention No. 87 provides that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved (or suspended) by administrative authority. The Committee has often pointed out that dissolution by the executive branch of the Government pursuant to a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not afford the right of defence and does not offer the necessary guarantees. In other words, trade unions should enjoy the protection of a normal judicial procedure where the national legislation provides for the dissolution (or suspension) of a trade union as a punishment for a serious breach of the law.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900068, response status: 200"

It claimed that these complaints were unfounded and did not mention a single specific case of infringement of the freedom of association Conventions. All persons living on the territory of a State, added the Government, were required to observe the laws of that country. Under Legislative Decree No. 105 of 7 June 1967, the instigators of a collective stoppage of work, and the ringleaders of such a stoppage, were liable to a fine of from 1,000 to 10,000 sucres and from two to five years' imprisonment. Persons who participated in such a work stoppage without having instigated it or being a ringleader were liable to a fine of from 200 to 1,000 sucres and from three months' to one year's imprisonment. A work stoppage within the meaning of this legislative decree was deemed to occur where there was a collective cessation of activity, where establishments were forcibly closed other than in the circumstances provided for by law, and in the event of paralysis of channels of communication or other anti social acts. These provisions had the force of a special Act and had precedence over those of general Acts which were contrary to them.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900067, response status: 200"

The Government appended the text of this decree, adopted on 25 May 1977.

In view of this right that trade unions are thus recognised to have, the Committee has always considered that the right to strike is a legitimate and, indeed, an essential means whereby workers may promote and defend their occupational interests. But it has added that the right to strike constitutes a fundamental right of workers and their organisations only in so far as it is utilised as a means of defending their economic interests, that the prohibition of strikes designed to coerce the government, if they are not occupational in character, does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association, and that strikes of a purely political nature do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association. In the present instance, a number of the demands made in connection with the strike of 18 May 1977 were clearly occupational in character, while others were not.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900067, response status: 200"

The Committee considers that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wish, any dissatisfaction they may feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their members' occupational interests, so long as such action consists merely in the expression of a protest and is not intended as a breach of the peace.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900067, response status: 200"

The first of these decrees punishes severely and in very broad terms collective stoppages of work. The Committee is of the opinion that this decree should be reviewed in the light of the considerations and principles set forth in the preceding paragraphs. The second, adopted only a few days after the strike in question, entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900067, response status: 200"

The police had been called in by a number of delegates to restore order, but refused to do so and scattered the workers who had gathered around the building where the meeting was being held in order to free the members of the Council A number of incidents subsequently took place in the hall. The persons from outside the Council obliged it to resume its discussions and circulated a document which they had prepared, demanding that the delegates sign it without having an opportunity to read it. Others were forced to sign a blank sheet of paper. Although they were obliged to sign this document the Council members totally rejected its contents. The armed students then exerted pressure to have the presidency of the Council given to Mr. Emilio Velasco, alleging that the President's resignation had already been accepted. Mr. Velasco began to direct the assembly, which was incomplete disorder. The students then obliged all the delegates to leave. The President, Mr. Cuisana Valencia, invited all the delegates to meet immediately on other premises.

In this regard the Committee considers it useful to point out, as it has recently done in another case, that judicial intervention would permit a clarification of the situation from the legal point of view, for the purpose of settling the question of the leadership and representation of the trade union federation concerned. Another possible means of settlement would be to appoint an independent arbitrator to be agreed on by the parties concerned, to seek a joint solution to existing problems and, if necessary, to hold new elections. In either case, the Government should recognise the leaders designated as legal representatives of the organisation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900000, response status: 200"

Moreover, continues the Government, the strike was illegal since it was not organised according to the procedure laid down in sections 436 et seq. of the Labour Code. The workers' demands were not submitted to a labour inspector, as provided for by law, but directly to the President of the Republic. The Government was accordingly obliged to take steps to end this unlawful action.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899468, response status: 200"

Once the emergency was over, however, Decree No. 1323 was issued on 31 August 1971 authorising the labour authorities to verify and review any action taken by employers under Decree No. 1079-A. It was not necessary, the Government states, to repeal formally Decree No. 1079-A since it was enforceable only for the duration of the strike. The Decree's exceptional character did not give rise to any change in the Labour Code and did not affect the principles of freedom of association and the right to strike, which are recognised so far as they remain within the framework of the law. The total number of dismissals for the country as a whole was 254, 60 per cent of whom returned to work, while a few of the remainder received compensation for wrongful dismissal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899468, response status: 200"

The Government was accordingly obliged to decree its dissolution. The Government adds that, as a conciliatory gesture, it ordered the reinstatement of all the social security workers who had been dismissed. In this connection, the Government transmits a press cutting indicating the satisfaction expressed by these employees for this action to the President of the Republic and to the Minister of Social Welfare and Labour. The Government states that the National Association of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers, which confined itself to its proper objectives, encountered no difficulties and continued to function normally.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899468, response status: 200"

What is more, states the Government, the leaders of the Confederation of Workers in Ecuador (CTE) and the Ecuadorian Confederation of Christian Workers (CEDOC) had recently, and publicly, expressed their support for the Minister of Labour, who had been attacked by certain employers. The leaders of these organisations, as well as of the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CEOSL) had met in the office of the Minister of Labour and had been consulted on the form to be given to the Code of Labour Procedure and on the way in which trade unions are to participate in the running of the Ecuadorian Vocational Training Service (SECAP). These consultations were held in a most friendly atmosphere. Consequently, adds the Government, no trade union leaders in the country had to carry out their activities clandestinely and, on the contrary, they could rely on the assistance of the authorities. It is therefore inconceivable that warrants are outstanding for the arrest of these trade union leaders. Any warrants issued were effective only during the emergency.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899468, response status: 200"

In this connection, the Committee refers, in particular, to the Programme of Action adopted by the United Workers' Front, most of which, in the view of the Committee, is either political in character or does not relate to labour matters. The Committee observes that the Programme of Action, inter alia, calls for the installation of a popular and democratic government and for reforms in the fields of defence, economic, social and educational matters, and in administration and public services. As a result of the Government's refusal to meet the demands called for in the said programme, the United Workers' Front organised a 48-hour national strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899468, response status: 200"

The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to this principle and to request the Government to indicate whether any judicial guarantees accompanied the dissolution of the union in question and, since the exceptional situation that had arisen now appears to be at an end, whether the union was reconstituted or under what conditions it may be reconstituted.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899468, response status: 200"

In this connection the Committee has, in previous cases, taken the view that the publication and distribution of news and information of general or special interest to trade unions and their members constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures for the control of publication and information may involve a serious interference by the administrative authorities with such activity. In such cases the exercise of administrative authority should be subject to judicial review at the earliest possible moment. However, since the restrictions imposed by the Government appear to have been of a temporary nature and confined to the dissemination of information concerning the illegal strike, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899468, response status: 200"

These meetings, continued the Government, were never held, as the staff was prevented from attending by certain other employees of the Subdirectorate, who were punished for their actions. In consequence, some of the staff of the Subdirectorate left their work in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution, whereupon the authorities took certain measures, as provided for by law, in order to avoid the paralysis of commercial air transport activities.

Further, the Committee considered that civil aviation personnel could not be deemed by virtue of the functions they performed to belong to the armed forces with a view to excluding them from the guarantees provided for under the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98). In the Committee's view, civil aviation personnel were public servants who were automatically covered by the provisions of Convention No. 87, which contains no exception clause for the case of public servants. Nor should they be excluded from the guarantees afforded under Convention No. 98, for although Article 6 of this Convention allows for the exclusion of "" public servants engaged in the administration of the State "", civil aviation personnel clearly do not fall within the scope of this exception.

Further, to the best of its knowledge, no members of the complainant association have been persecuted. As regards the recommendations contained in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 379 of the Committee's interim report, the Government states that the General Directorate of Civil Aviation maintains the best possible relations with a number of organisations, but that the actual relations between the Directorate and its staff are governed by staff regulations which have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Armed Forces Personnel Act. The Government also states that it complies with all International Labour Conventions and treats all lawfully constituted employees' organisations with the respect due to them, as evidence of which it indicates that at present there exists an association of the Directorate's own staff approved by the Minister of Labour which is allowed to carry on its activities freely. In conclusion, the Government recalls that Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, to which reference is made in the interim report, provide for the exemption of members of the armed forces from the guarantees provided for therein, and that, under section 250 of the Political Constitution of the State of Ecuador, employees of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation form part of the armed forces of the country.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899265, response status: 200"

The Directorate had not recognised the Association of Aeronautical Technicians, which had presented claims on behalf of these employees, and referred to various provisions of national legislation according to which the workers concerned were subject to military jurisdiction.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899265, response status: 200"

It is, moreover, the Committee's view that, had the Directorate entered into discussions with the Association, the events which had led to the filing of the complaint might never have occurred.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899265, response status: 200"

However, the Committee also notes that the Government once again draws attention to the fact that the employees of the Directorate form part of the armed forces and that, in consequence, they may be excluded from the provisions of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98. From this it would not seem that the Government would be prepared to extend recognition of the above-mentioned association to recognition for collective bargaining purposes.

The Director-General goes on to state that, even though the Association has no connection whatsoever with the Directorate of Civil Aviation, the latter, with the aim of resolving any possible difficulties, called meetings of the staff of the Sub-Directorate in question, in Quito and in Guayaquil, "" for the purpose of giving an account both of the action which it had taken on behalf of its employees and of the obligations of the latter towards the Directorate "". It was not possible to hold these meetings owing to the fact that the staff invited to attend them were prevented from doing so by three employees of the Sub-Directorate for the Coastal Region and four employees working at Quito Airport, who were punished for their action in accordance with the relevant regulations. In the light of this situation, some of the staff of the Sub-Directorate for Flight Protection left their work, in opposition to the principles laid down in the Constitution, whereupon the authorities took certain measures, as provided for by law, in order to avoid, in this way, the paralysis of commercial air-transport activities.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899266, response status: 200"

Both Conventions allow national legislation to exclude the armed forces from the guarantees provided for therein. In the Committee's view the workers concerned cannot be deemed, by virtue of the functions they perform, to belong to the armed forces with a view to excluding them from coverage by the Conventions, but should be classified as employees of the State or public servants for the purposes of these instruments.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899266, response status: 200"

As concerns Convention No. 87, which speaks of "" workers ... without distinction whatsoever "" (Article 2), all public servants are covered by the guarantees for which it provides in respect of the right to organise. As for Convention No. 98, Article 6 allows for the exclusion of "" public servants engaged in the administration of the State "". In this respect the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out that while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of public servants who do not act as agents of the public authority is contrary to the meaning of the Convention. The distinction to be drawn, therefore, according to the Committee of Experts, would appear to be, basically, between civil servants employed in various capacities in government ministries or comparable bodies-that is public servants who, by their functions, are directly engaged in the administration of the State as well as lower-ranking officials who act as supporting elements in these activities-on the one hand, and other persons employed by the Government, by public undertakings or by autonomous public institutions, on the other hand. The Committee on Freedom of Association observes that the civil aviation technicians involved in the present case obviously do not fall within the category of employees of the State whose functions justify their exclusion from the scope of Convention No. 98.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899266, response status: 200"

Secondly, it is necessary to apply to such workers the provisions of Article 4 of Convention No. 98, which states that "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "".

In Case No. 66 (Greece) the Committee had expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, was not in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. It considered in this respect that it should be guided by the conclusions approved by the Governing Body in 1937 and 1938 with regard to two representations submitted by the Madras Labour Union for Textile Workers and by the Soci茅t茅 de Bienfaisance des Travailleurs de l'Ile Maurice, in accordance with article 23 of the Constitution of the Organisation (now article 24). The Governing Body at that time established the principle that, from the moment that a representation was submitted to it, it alone was competent to decide what effect should be given to it, and that "" the withdrawal by the organisation making the representation is not always proof that the representation is not receivable or is not well founded "". The Committee considered that, in implementing this principle, it was free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether they appeared sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898913, response status: 200"

The Committee, therefore, requested the Director-General to seek this additional information from P.T.T.I, adjourning in the meantime its examination of the case.

In these circumstances the complaining organisation considers that it would be purposeless to examine the matter further. It expresses regret, however, that the procedure for the consideration of complaints of violation of freedom of association submitted to the I.L.O. "" is such as to rule out in practice the possibility of the I.L.O making an impact at the right time "" in situations such as that which arose in the case of FENETEL.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898913, response status: 200"

As regards the views expressed by the complainant with respect to the existing procedure for the examination of complaints of violations of trade union rights submitted to the International Labour Organisation, it is difficult to see in which precise context those views are presented.

By a communication dated 27 August 1965 the Government declared, without giving any more precise details, that the arrest referred to had been carried out for infringement of specific provisions of the penal legislation which had no connection with trade union activities. On re-examining the case at its meeting held in November 1965, the Committee noted that in similar cases it had always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests or detentions and the exact reasons therefor. It also noted that, if in certain cases the Committee had concluded that allegations relating to the arrests or detentions of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this had been after it had received information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests or detentions were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political character. Finally, in paragraph 540 (b) of its 85th Report, the Committee again recommended the Governing Body to reiterate to the Government its request to send more complete information on this aspect of the case, including an account of the offences with which each of the trade unionists had been charged and the result of the prosecutions commenced in this respect.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898891, response status: 200"

The Government stated in its reply that the arrest of Messrs. Checa and Aroca was due to blatant infringements of specific provisions of the penal legislation of Ecuador. The authorities responsible for applying the appropriate penalty, however, had been conciliatory enough to order the release of these men with the very purpose of avoiding the distortion of the reasons for their arrest. The Government declared in this connection that the fact of being a trade union official did not entitle anyone to devote himself to overthrowing public order on the pretext of organising workers' unions. As regards the arrest of Messrs. Moreno Rocha, Hidrovo Vergara (called Idovro Vergara by the complainants) and Zamora P茅rez, the Government stated that, according to the information supplied by the authorities dealing with each case, the arrest was due to these persons having been found distributing subversive leaflets with no printer's mark and disturbing political order in the district, particularly among the country people; the three men were released after signing a declaration before the authorities, binding them to take no part in political activities which in the opinion of the Government have no connection with trade unionism. The distribution of leaflets with no printer's mark is an offence punishable under section 272 of the Penal Code with imprisonment of from three months to one year and a fine of from 80 to 200 sucres.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898891, response status: 200"

However, in view of what had been said by the Government concerning political activities in connection with the trade unionists' acts, the Committee thought it necessary to bear in mind the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations which states that "" provisions prohibiting trade unions in general terms from engaging in any political activities ... may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given to them in practice may change at any moment and restrict considerably the possibility of action of the organisations. In this connection the Committee thinks it useful to make reference to the resolution adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 35th Session (Geneva, 1951) in which it is stated, among other things, that when trade unions undertake or associate themselves with political action, this action shall not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of the trade union movement or its social or economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country It would therefore seem that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms and a priori all political activities by occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of their members "".","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898891, response status: 200"

In September 1964 trade union leaders Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca were incarcerated in Machachi on being apprehended attending a meeting of peasants convened to found a peasants' league for that locality. At approximately the same time in Naranjito, trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora P茅rez were incarcerated for distributing leaflets to peasants with the aim of convening a meeting to found another peasants' league. At a later date, in the province of Chimborazo, the civil and military chief of the area imprisoned a number of peasant leaders for forming a trade union on the Huayllamba estate and campaigning for their rights; he also threatened the C.E.D.O.C leaders in the province, sending a telegram to C.E.D.O.C reading as follows: "" Owner Huayllamba estate settled problems fairly. Demagogic party campaign you are conducting cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. Extremist agitators in your service will be treated as they deserve.""

Furthermore, the Government rejected the allegation that a military chief used force to defend the estate owners. The Huayllamba estate case was finally settled by the intervention of an official sent by the Director-General of Labour, and an agreement between employer and agricultural workers was signed. Unfortunately the trade union backed by C.E.D.O.C, deviating from its specific objectives, engaged in incitement to violence and thus brought about the subsequent intervention of the police authorities after the labour aspect of the problem had been solved.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898894, response status: 200"

In September 1964 trade union leaders Francisco Checa and Carlos Aroca were imprisoned in Machachi after they had been apprehended attending a meeting of peasants convened to found a peasants' league for that locality. At approximately the same time in Naranjito trade unionists Pedro Moreno Rocha, Carlos Idovro Vergara and Mesias Zamora P茅rez were incarcerated for distributing leaflets to peasants with the aim of convening a meeting to found another peasants' league. At a later date, in the province of Chimborazo, the civil and military chief of the area imprisoned a number of peasant leaders for forming a trade union on the Huayllamba estate and campaigning for their rights; he also threatened the C.E.D.O.C leaders in the province, sending a telegram to C.E.D.O.C reading as follows: "" Owner Huayllamba estate settled problems fairly. Demagogic party campaign you are conducting cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. Extremist agitators in your service will be treated as they deserve.""

This organisation enjoys the same safeguards for pursuing its trade union activity as the other workers' associations formed in compliance with the law and recognised by the Government. Furthermore, the Government rejects the allegation that a military chief used force to defend the estate owners. The Huayllamba estate case was finally settled by the intervention of an official sent by the Director-General of Labour, and the agreement between employer and agricultural workers was signed. Unfortunately, the trade union backed by C.E.D.O.C, deviating from its specific objectives, engaged in incitement to violence and thus brought about the subsequent intervention of the police authorities after the labour aspect of the problem had been solved.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898893, response status: 200"

The Government answered that it was unable to approve these by-laws because there had never been any meeting with sufficient unity to be described as a founders' meeting which must exist before a works council could be constituted. Accordingly the Government stated that it had appointed a committee to tour the railways and ask the workers whether they belonged to the Works Council or the Ecuadorian Railwaymen's Union, which was already in existence and opposed recognition of the Council.

In the present case the meeting was not attended by such a percentage of the workers, and those who attended as delegates were not appointed by local meetings; instead, the signatures submitted to show that more than half of the workers in the undertaking supported the Works Council had been collected over a space of two years.

The complainants contend that this is an illegal procedure and that in any case the government representatives and members of the management acted improperly by giving preference to the Railwaymen's Union and bringing pressure to bear on the workers in order to prevent its being proved that the Works Council had majority support. The outcome of the inquiry was that the President of the Republic refused to approve the by-laws on the grounds that the Works Council did not have the statutory majority.

It emerges from the Government's reply that it considers that there should be only one meeting. The Committee observes that this requirement may turn out to be impracticable in the case of a railway undertaking if the line covers an extensive part of the national territory. The Committee also observes that there appears to be no definite rule with regard to the procedure to be followed in order to determine whether a works council has majority support when the undertaking is of the type involved in this case, and when such majority support is questioned. On the one hand the presidential decision refusing to approve the by-laws seems to accept the system of signatures adopted by the Works Council, and bases the refusal on the report of the committee of inquiry, according to which only a minority of the workers stated they were in favour of the Works Council; and on the other hand the Government in its reply gives as a ground for refusing approval that ""there was never a genuine constituent assembly reflecting the unity of action which is an essential feature of a founders' meeting in the proper sense"". Similarly, the report from the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour does not recognise the system of signatures, and emphasises that the founders' meeting must be attended by over 50 per cent of the workers or that the delegates who attend such a meeting must have been elected at local meetings.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898646, response status: 200"

The complainants allege that 1,587 signatures were collected, plus 164 at a later date, making a total of 1,751. This figure would exceed 50 per cent of the workers in the undertaking, who are said to total 3,030 according to figures supplied by the book-keeping department of the undertaking. The labour inspector involved in this case certifies that he received 1,587 signatures and that this figure ""corresponds to over 50 per cent of the workers on the State Railways"". The Government in its reply transmits the report from the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Ministry, which states that it emerges from the investigation that some 95 per cent of railway workers said they were opposed to the Works Council. On the other hand the presidential decision refusing approval of the by-laws states that the application was accompanied by 1,538 signatures, that the workers of the undertaking total 3,330 and that the committee appointed by the Chamber of Deputies to go into the workers' wishes reported that 1,075 said they were in favour of the Railwaymen's Union, 375 in favour of the Works Council and 133 in favour of both, while 60 resigned from the Works Council and 70 expressed a wish to belong to neither organisation. Subsequently the Chamber of Deputies sent in documents reporting the resignation of 141 workers from the Works Council. A copy of the report of the special committee of the Chamber of Deputies which was sent in by complainants states that not a single forged signature was discovered and that 1,182 workers were questioned, of whom 821 said they were in favour of the Railwaymen's Union and 467 in favour of the Works Council, while 39 did not belong to any organisation.

The Government has made no comments on this. According to the complainants, who have forwarded affidavits from two officials of trade unions affiliated to C.E.D.O.C who accompanied the committee, the officials of the Ministry refused to accept new members of the Works Council, whereas they accepted resignations from it and new members of the Railwaymen's Union. Similarly, preference was given to the meetings organised by the Union and by the State Railways; a number of workers reported that they were coerced into signing for membership of the Union and into resigning from the Works Council. The witnesses also noted that members of the management (one of them a brother of the General Secretary of the Union) organised meetings hostile to the Works Council to give support to the Union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898646, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that in no case do all the workers of the undertaking seem to have been questioned and that in no case have figures been collected that would allow a final judgment to be reached on the number of members of either trade union organisation. On the contrary, the procedure used to check whether the Works Council did or did not have majority support seems to have given rise to acts of discrimination and interference by employers and at any rate to have made it difficult for the workers to express their views freely.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898646, response status: 200"

As a result of the dispute the Subdirector of Labour of Guayaquil handed down an award which was said to concede the majority of the workers' claims. The complainants allege, however, that the award contains a serious attack on the right to strike, in that it includes a clause stating "" that the workers in question may not avail themselves of the right to strike on account of the Constitutional principle laid down in the second paragraph of clause (i) of article 185 of the Political Constitution "". On the basis of this clause, they argue, the right to strike could be denied to all the public service workers in the country. According to the complainants this Constitutional clause guarantees the right to strike by providing, to quote their words, that "" the right of public service workers to strike shall be covered by special rules "". Such rules not yet having been issued, it is alleged that the right to strike is not limited by any restrictive conditions.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898329, response status: 200"

",['f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898329'],"91.The Government replied to the complaint in a memorandum of 25 September 1958, enclosing a long appendix consisting of a newspaper clipping reporting a statement by the Minister of Social Security and Labour on the sequence of events. In the documentation furnished by the Government, it is stated that, following the filing of a statement of demands by the municipal employees of Guayaquil, various agreements came to be signed in February 1957. However, the agreed stipulations were never carried into effect as various changes occurred in the mayoralty, which finally resolved to dismiss 59 workers. A new statement of demands was presented as a result, and the Ministry of Labour undertook a series of conciliation measures that proved unsuccessful. Under these circumstances the workers decided to have recourse to strike action and notified the Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal which had intervened in the dispute. After a series of judicial proceedings the case was referred to the Subdirector of Labour for the Coastal Region, who gave an award in second instance ; this award was not observed by the Municipality, which refused to reinstate the workers who had taken part in the strike, "" the dismissal thus being clearly shown to be contrary to the stipulations of the award "". The parties thereupon applied to the Tribunal, which granted a writ of execution of the award, and the Ecuadorian Confederation of Labour moved the Council of State to intervene, in order to oblige the Municipality to give effect to the award. The Government maintains that the dispute was legally terminated by the award handed down on appeal by the Subdirector of Labour for the Coastal Region, in which he ordered an immediate resumption of work by the strikers and payment of wages by the Municipality for the strike period.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898329, response status: 200"

This general principle, however, as the Committee has observed in several earlier cases, may be restricted both in what are deemed to be essential services and in the civil service. The Committee has stressed the importance it attaches in such cases to the existence of machinery for the peaceful settlement of such disputes, in order that the workers thus deprived of so essential a means of defending occupational interests as legal strike action may be assured of adequate safeguards. The Committee has also held that although a strike may be temporarily restricted by law until existing facilities for negotiation, conciliation and arbitration can be brought to bear, such limitation or counteraction should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and that "" where the law places restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike, appropriate guarantees should be afforded to the workers concerned in the form of adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes "".","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898329, response status: 200"

This article lays down in fine that "" employees of public works and institutions of public service may not go on strike, except in accordance with special rules "". These rules have not yet been promulgated. It was on these premises that the Subdirector of Labour decided that workers in public services could not have recourse to strike.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2898329, response status: 200"
