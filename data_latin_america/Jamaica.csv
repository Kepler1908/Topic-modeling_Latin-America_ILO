It also concluded that the legal system in force, which confers upon the Minister of Labour discretionary powers to decide whether to organise a ballot without the possibility of appeal against his decision, entails the risk of bias and abuse, as appears to have happened in the present situation in which the workers, although at present represented by a lawfully constituted union, could not promote and defend their interests through collective bargaining. The Committee requested the Government to consider reviewing the situation and, more particularly, to have recourse to the provisions of the Act of 1975 under which the Minister may refer a dispute to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900883, response status: 200"

The complainant's letter did not contain new allegations, but in its letter of 5 July 1983 the Government stated that, in order for the dispute to be referred to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal, the Minister must decide to cause a ballot to be taken. Such a decision can only be made if the Minister is satisfied, inter alia, that not less than 40 per cent of the workers in relation to whom the request for a ballot has been made are members of the union. According to the Government, in the present case the union failed to satisfy that requirement of the relevant law, and hence the matter cannot be referred to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal. The Government added that, on 25 May 1983, the union served a new claim for bargaining rights. However, according to the Government, the union failed to request the Minister (in writing) to cause a ballot to be taken within 30 days of the date of the claim, as required by the relevant law. Hence, this latter claim has lapsed.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900883, response status: 200"

Upon receiving these documents the Minister may then decide to organise a ballot if certain conditions have been met, and in particular if he considers that 40 per cent of the workers in the bargaining unit are members of the union; in order to ensure that the latter condition is met he must take the measures he deems appropriate in respect both of the employer and of the union.

The Committee notes, moreover, that a union may be deprived of the right to promote and defend its members' interests either because these members do not represent 40 per cent of the bargaining unit - which, according to the law, means that a ballot cannot be held - or because, following a ballot, it has not obtained the majority of votes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900882, response status: 200"

Brian Meeks and Pat Riley despite the fact that there were no legal barriers to having workers on the Board and despite the Government's statement that it was committed to worker participation and despite the appointment of workers to the boards of other Government-owned bodies. According to the complainant, in spite of numerous attempts on its part, the Corporation refused to appoint the worker representatives, or any other two workers, to the Board and the matter was referred to the Ministry of Labour for conciliation. After two meetings had been held, the Director of Industrial Relations informed the NWU that it was the view of the Ministry that this particular issue did not qualify as an industrial dispute and consequently would not be further pursued by the Ministry.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900536, response status: 200"

Meeks and Bogues redundant. After unsuccessful discussion with the Corporation, the matter was referred to the Ministry for conciliation which also failed; the NWU asked for the matter to be referred to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal in accordance with section 6 of the Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act, 1975, and with the grievance procedure clause of the collective agreement in force between the NWU and the Corporation, but the Corporation refused to join in the referral. The grievance paragraph 37(e) reads ""failing settlement of such mediation the dispute shall be referred to arbitration and the decision thereon shall be binding on both parties"". The complainant further claims that the Minister refused to intervene in a positive manner as he is entitled under section 10 of the Act (discretion to refer an industrial dispute, other than those in an essential service, to the Tribunal for settlement) in a definite attempt to abrogate from the rights of the union. The NWU also claims that this action contravened Part VI, paragraph 21, of the Labour Relations Code of 1976 which sets out the steps to be included and followed in a collective agreement, steps which were included in the agreement in force between the union and the Corporation.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900536, response status: 200"

The dismissed persons included Mr. Carl Campbell, Chief Delegate for the NWU, whose dismissal, according to the complainant, not only drives fear into the hearts of other prospective delegates and the workers in general, but also contravenes the disciplinary procedures set out in Part VI(e) of the Labour Relations Code i.e. ""no disciplinary action should normally be taken against a delegate until the circumstances of the case have been discussed with a full-time official of the union concerned"". According to the complainant, discussion of this action with the Corporation was unsuccessful; the matter was taken to the Ministry for conciliation but this again proved futile as the Corporation refused to allow the dispute to go to arbitration. The complainant submits that this victimisation is contrary to section 24(3) of the Constitution which states that no individual should be discriminated against in any manner whether by reason of his race, place of origin, political opinions, colour or any such criteria. It successfully sought an injunction before the High Court to prevent the Corporation from filling the 13 posts and states that a final ruling should be forthcoming shortly on the final aspect of the injunction hearing.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900536, response status: 200"

The Labour Relations code - paragraph 21 of which is cited by the complainant - only sets out guidelines helpful for the purpose of promoting good labour relations, and the collective agreement in force - paragraph 37(e) of which is cited by the complainant - does not specify that both parties to a dispute shall refer it to arbitration in the case of failure to settle it by mediation but states that ""the dispute shall be referred to arbitration "" Section 10 of the Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act, 1975, also cited by the complainant, merely sets out a ministerial discretion to intervene. Lastly, presumably because the collective agreement is not explicit in this respect, the complainant cites section 6 of the Act which reads as follows:","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900536, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that neither the two persons involved nor the complainant organisation challenged the Minister's omission before other forums. In this respect, it would point out, as it has done in the past, that where a worker feels that he is the subject of anti-union practices, he should be able to appeal to a court or to some other authority independent of the parties concerned. Nevertheless, in view of the lack of detailed information before the Committee, it is of the opinion that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.As concerns the retrenchment of 13 unionised workers at the Station, including the chief delegate to the NWU, the Committee notes that the complainant sees this action on the part of the Government as part of a broader attack on trade unions and that the Government answers this allegation by referring to the fact that the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. Although the Committee has recognised that it would be extremely difficult for a worker who was dismissed by an employer invoking, for example ""neglect of duty"", to prove that the real motive for his dismissal was to be found in his trade union activities, it considers that the fact that the 13 allegedly redundant posts were re-advertised to the public is hardly indicative of good faith on the part of the employer. The Committee would accordingly point out to the Government that one of the basic principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, transfer, demotion and other prejudicial measures - and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. It would like to be informed of the outcome of the Supreme Court action in the hope that the 13 unionised workers will be reinstated in their posts or, if this is not possible, at least compensated for the discrimination shown them.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2900536, response status: 200"

The Bank maintained its refusal to negotiate and took action to place the Bank's staff club under the control of the management. The Ministry of Labour was said not only to have failed to set up the necessary machinery to deal with the dispute, but also to have collaborated with the employer and to be the first to supply strike breakers. It conducted an investigation in which only managers of the Bank were interviewed, thus providing itself with a false basis on which to refuse to act against the Bank and to justify its reluctance to make full use of the collective bargaining machinery. According to the complainants, the police also collaborated with the Bank: on 26 April 1974, 12 members of the Union were arrested for lying down in the street; four days later, the General Secretary of the Union was assaulted by four police officers while demonstrating in front of the Bank's head office; the same day, a high-level meeting was held between the management of the Bank and senior police officers; two days later, eight strike pickets were arrested and remanded in custody following a telephone call from the management.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899732, response status: 200"

With the agreement of the parties concerned, the Ministry may take a poll by secret ballot to determine the wishes of the workers concerned; the agreement usually provides that the outcome of the poll will determine the bargaining position of the parties. A poll may also be taken by the Ministry to determine the number of members of a union in a particular establishment, but no poll can be conducted without the co-operation of the employer. The latter must provide a list of the workers involved and permit ministry officials to enter its premises and conduct such a poll during working hours.

With respect to the representation of workers by one or more trade unions, section 5 provides that the Minister may, in the event of doubt or dispute, order a poll in order to determine the workers' organisation(s) entitled to negotiate with the employer. If the majority of the workers vote in favour of a union, the employer must recognise its bargaining rights or lay himself open to severe penalties. Several unions may acquire this right in relation to an employer if each receives at least 30 per cent of the votes. An employer who impedes a vote is punishable with a fine not exceeding $1,000. If the Minister is unable to settle a dispute regarding the determination of the category of workers concerned by the vote, he must refer the dispute to a court.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899732, response status: 200"

The Committee also notes that they were found guilty by the courts and then released.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899732, response status: 200"

The Committee has already pointed out, in another case relating to Jamaica, that complaints concerning anti-union practices should normally be examined by appropriate machinery. The Committee notes that the new Act of 8 April 1975 provides for recourse to a court and severe sanctions in the event of anti-union activities. The Committee considers that this new Act can be expected to prevent the practices which the complainants allege have been used by the employer.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899732, response status: 200"

The information available in these cases, as confirmed by the first information communicated by the Government in the present case, shows that in any case the Ministry could not organise a poll in order to determine the representative union(s) entitled to conduct collective bargaining, without the collaboration of the employer. In the case under discussion the employer refused his collaboration and thus prevented a poll being organised.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899732, response status: 200"

The Ministry of Labour, for its part, is said not only to have failed to set up the necessary machinery to deal with the dispute but to have collaborated with the employer and was the first to supply strike-breakers. It conducted an investigation in which only managers of the Bank were interviewed, thus providing itself with a false basis on which to refuse to act against the Bank and to justify its reluctance to utilise fully the machinery for collective bargaining. According to the complainants, the police also collaborated with the Bank: on 26 April 1974, twelve members of the union were arrested for lying down in the street; four days later, the general secretary of the union was physically assaulted by four police officers while demonstrating at the Bank's head office; the same day a high-level meeting was held between the management of the Bank and senior officers of the Jamaica constabulary force; two days later, eight strike pickets were arrested and remanded in custody, following a telephone call from the management.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The Minister of Labour is said to have admitted to being almost powerless to do anything because no national laws existed to give him effective authority to settle the dispute.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The Bank is also said to have attempted to have members of the union dismissed from their jobs in other industries such as the insurance and tourist industries, and to have informed various businesses, particularly supermarkets, not to accept the cheques of strikers. The Ministry of Labour, for its part, has not set up a Commission of Inquiry, although it has been requested to do so since 25 April 1974.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

It declares that it encourages autonomy in industry, and that to this end the Ministry of Labour and Employment provides machinery for the determination of representational issues involving trade unions. By agreement with the parties concerned, the Ministry may take a poll by secret ballot to determine the wishes of the workers concerned; the agreement usually provides for a determination of the bargaining position based upon the outcome of the poll. A poll may also be taken by the Ministry to determine the extent of the membership of a union in a particular establishment. But no poll can be conducted without the co-operation of the employer, who must provide a list of the workers involved and permit Ministry officials to enter its premises and conduct such a poll during working hours. According to the Government, the Bill mentioned above, which is expected to become law shortly, contains provisions for the compulsory recognition of a trade union which wins a poll. In addition the National Constitution specifically guarantees to workers the right to belong to the trade union of their choice.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

It is stated therein that the two parties requested the intervention of the Ministry, which asked the union to supply an audited certificate of membership (which it did) and the Bank to indicate whether any other union represented or was claiming to represent the workers, and to supply a list of its employees. The union informed the Ministry that the Bank refused to allow it to represent the supervisory staff, and the Bank requested the Ministry to intervene on this issue. Meetings were held separately with both parties, following which the Bank submitted a list of its employees. A comparison of this list with the union's certificate of membership showed that the union had established a prima facie case for representational rights. Both parties were accordingly invited to suggest convenient dates for a meeting to finalise arrangements for the taking of a poll, but the Bank announced that its legal representative was not available to attend such a meeting.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The union insisted that it was a strike and that the Ministry should intervene. An investigation was made on 16 April, continues the Government, and branch managers and union members were interviewed; union officers were not available. The information compiled indicated that the action had affected only two branches of the Bank (including the one where the dismissed worker was employed) and that only twenty-three workers out of one hundred and sixty-four had participated in it, assisted by a few outsiders holding office in the union. The Bank declared that its operations were not affected and refused to attend any meeting with the union because of alleged damage to cars and threats to management personnel and other employees who had remained on the job. The union again asked the Minister to intervene and reported that the Government Employment Services had provided a driver for the Bank during the strike. In fact, according to the Government, this person had been supplied by a private employment agency, like all the other workers recruited by the Bank.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The strike petered out due to the small number of participants and the fact that some of the strikers sought and obtained reinstatement while others obtained alternative employment. As concerns the refusal to set up a board of inquiry, the Government states that this procedure is reserved for use in major issues involving the national interest or issues in which public opinion is likely to lend weight to any recommendations made, such recommendations not being binding on the parties. This case was not considered to involve such issues. The Government likewise refutes the accusations of collaboration between the police and the employer and points out that workers are allowed to engage in peaceful picketing. However, continues the Government, on 26 April and 2 May 1974 employees of the Bank who were union members and other union officers blocked the entrance to the Bank and blocked traffic in the street. They defied an order to move and used threatening and insulting language to the police. They were arrested, tried during the first week of September, found guilty, admonished and discharged.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

According to the complainants the employer committed, before and during the resultant strike, acts of anti-union discrimination and interference in the union's activities. Lastly, strike pickets were arrested.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The Committee notes that according to the Government workers are allowed to engage in peaceful picketing during a work stoppage, but in this specific instance they blocked the entrance to the Bank as well as traffic in the street, refused to move and used threatening and insulting language to the police. The Committee further notes that they were found guilty by the courts and discharged.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The Committee has already stressed in another case relating to Jamaica that complaints against anti-union practices should normally be examined by national machinery; although it would be desirable to settle such grievances wherever possible by discussion without treating the process as a form of litigation, in cases where differences of opinion arise resort should be had to impartial bodies or individuals representing the final step of the grievance procedure. The Committee is of the opinion that these considerations and principles are equally valid in the present case as concerns the allegations relating both to anti-union practices and to acts of interference by the employer.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

It appeared from the information available in those cases - and the present case bears it out - that where a poll is conducted on the basis of an agreement between the parties, that agreement usually provides for a determination of the bargaining position based upon the outcome of the poll; a fact-finding poll, on the other hand, not being based upon an agreement, merely determines the wishes of the workers in respect of the claimant union. In any event, no poll of any kind can be conducted by the Ministry without the co-operation of the employer, who must provide a list of the names of the workers involved and permit the Ministry to enter and conduct such a poll on its premises during working hours.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The Committee has also stated that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided such a claim appears to be plausible, and that, if the union concerned is found to be the majority union, the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures with a view to obtaining the employer's recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

The Bill provides that the Minister may, at the request of the employer or of any trade union claiming bargaining rights in relation to a group of workers in the proposed unit, cause a ballot to be taken for the purpose of determining which unions are most representative, and that, if the ballot shows that a majority of workers wish a particular union to represent them, the employer is obliged to recognise that union as bargaining agent or be liable to stringent penalties. The Committee has remarked that, although from the language of the Bill it would appear that the Minister has discretion as to whether to order such a poll or not, the Minister has stated in Parliament that it has been decided to legislate for compulsory recognition of trade unions based on ""certification procedures"" including compulsory poll-taking.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899731, response status: 200"

In this case, the provision made for tripartite arbitration machinery, which is of wider application in the field of labour disputes, or other procedures agreed upon by the parties and in which the parties to the dispute are equally represented would seem to satisfy the criteria which have guided the Committee in its past considerations, provided, however, that in the case of disputes in an essential service in which the Government or municipal authorities are the employer, the award of this Tribunal is binding upon the Government or municipality. The Bill is not entirely clear on this point.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899702, response status: 200"

In his statement made upon the presentation of this Bill to Parliament (a copy of which was forwarded by the Government), the Minister of Labour and Employment stated that public passenger transport had been included because of the need to transport workers to their jobs, particularly those employed in other essential services and the necessity to curtail the activities of illegal drivers whose passengers are not protected by insurance and whose vehicles may not have been given the necessary road safety certificates. According to section 28 of the Bill, however, the Minister of Labour may at any time amend the list of essential services subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Further, the Minister may order compulsory arbitration (and in consequence cessation of industrial action) in relation to any industrial dispute, even if not in an ""essential service"", if it appears to him that it has caused or would cause an interruption in the supply of goods or in the provisions of services of such a nature or on such a scale as to be likely to be gravely injurious to the national interest. The Minister explained to the House, in his statement referred to above, that the Government felt that the time had come when the Minister, representing the public in general, must be vested with authority under the law to secure resumption of the flow of goods and services while procedures are set in motion to effect a settlement. The Minister added that this power would not be lightly used, but only in cases where the national interest is gravely endangered.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899702, response status: 200"

The Committee recommended that the Government should be requested to indicate what steps if any had been taken or were being considered to establish a procedure such as that suggested by the Committee. At paragraph 4 of its 142nd Report, the Committee noted that the Government had reported that it proposed in January 1974 to put before Parliament a Bill which would provide inter alia for compulsory poll-taking to determine trade union claims for recognition and the compulsory recognition of unions in cases where the union had established that it represented a specific proportion of the labour force.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899702, response status: 200"

Although from the language of section 5 it would appear that the Minister has discretion as to whether to order such a poll or not, the Minister, in his statement before Parliament referred to in paragraph 42 above, stated that ""it has now been decided to legislate for compulsory recognition of trade unions based on certification procedures including compulsory poll-taking which will not be subject to the Minister's discretion"".

In general terms this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds a trade union office confers on him immunity against measures such as dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. The activities of trade union officials should, however, be considered in the context of particular situations which may be especially strained and difficult in cases of labour disputes and strike action. In the present case, an additional element to be considered is the no-victimisation clause included in the resumption-of-work agreement.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899620, response status: 200"

A fact-finding poll may be taken by the Ministry to determine the extent of the membership of the union in the particular establishment. The Government adds that in no case can a poll of any kind be conducted by the Ministry without the co-operation of the employer who must provide a list of names of the workers involved in order to permit the Ministry to enter and conduct such a poll on its premises during working hours. The Government attaches to its communication a copy of the ""Directions by the Ministry of Labour on the taking of polls in representational disputes between trade unions"". The Government states that the principle of allowing workers to negotiate through the union of their choice is clearly expressed in this document.

In the majority of the cases the claimant unions have taken strike action, and with the exception of the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation, the other companies have bluntly refused to recognise the unions or to participate in the taking of a poll. The Government adds that while it strongly supports the principle of trade union recognition in a free enterprise society, as is the case in Jamaica, it is unable to compel employers to recognise any particular union. The Government points out that it is significant that the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation, which has recognised the union concerned, is a statutory body set up by the Government.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899562, response status: 200"

This procedure is laid down in the ""Directions by the Minister of Labour"", a copy of which has been supplied by the Government. In terms of these directions the Labour Adviser may take a poll when he is satisfied that a considerable proportion of the workers concerned wish it, but subject to the following conditions: (a) if there is agreement between all the parties to the dispute; (b) if the employer and one or more of the unions concerned agree to the poll; and (c) where two or more unions agree to the taking of a poll. Section 4 of these Directions provides that, where consent as required in (a), (b) and (c) above cannot be obtained the Labour Adviser may, if he is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out by the claimant union, take the poll, subject to a deposit being made by the claimant union.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899562, response status: 200"

According to the information at the disposal of the Committee, it appears that where a poll is conducted on the basis of an agreement between the parties, that agreement usually provides for a determination of the bargaining position based upon the outcome of the poll. A fact-finding poll, not being based upon an agreement, merely determines the wishes of the workers in respect of the claimant union. But, as the Government explains, in any event, no poll of any kind can be conducted by the Ministry without the cooperation of the employer who must provide a list of the names of the workers involved, and permit the Ministry to enter and conduct such a poll on its premises during working hours.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899562, response status: 200"

In the case of the four remaining undertakings, the Committee notes that although claims for recognition have been lodged with the Ministry of Labour and Employment by the unions concerned, along with supporting evidence of membership, no representation polls have yet been taken. In at least two of these cases (viz. Kelly's Group of Companies, and Jamaica Laminates, etc. (now Building Components Ltd.)), the Committee notes from the information supplied by the Government that the union concerned (in each case the Jamaica Congress of Labour) has made out a prima facie case for a representation poll to be taken. According to the information at the disposal of the Committee it would seem that the managements of the various undertakings involved have refused to co-operate in the representation poll procedure either by failing or delaying to communicate necessary information to the Ministry, or by failing to attend meetings called by the Ministry to discuss the question of recognition.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899562, response status: 200"

The Committee has also taken the view that, if there is a change in the relative strength of unions competing for a preferential right or the power to represent workers exclusively for collective bargaining purposes, then it is desirable that there should be the possibility of a review of the factual bases on which that right or power was granted. In the absence of such a possibility, a majority of the workers concerned might be represented by a union which, for an unduly long period, could be prevented - either in fact or in law - from organising its administration and activities with a view to fully furthering and defending the interests of its members.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899562, response status: 200"

If the union concerned is found to be the majority union, the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures with a view to obtaining the employer's recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899562, response status: 200"

In addition, the Association felt that the Union, by its action in certain establishments, was "" undermining all discipline, creating abuse to customers and generally leaving the employees with the impression that they were immune to any discipline.""","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899284, response status: 200"

There are two possible courses of action: where the agreement of both sides is obtained the Ministry may conduct an industrial poll, the results of which invariably settle the bargaining position of the union vis-脿-vis the employer; where the agreement of the employer is not obtained, the claimant union may, subject to certain conditions being met, request the Ministry to conduct a fact-finding poll, the results of which, however, merely determine the wishes of the workers in respect of the claimant union. Moreover, in its observations in the present case the Government states that in order to take a fact-finding poll the Ministry must receive the co-operation of the employer, who is required to provide a list of his workers and permit the Ministry to enter and conduct the poll on his premises during working hours.","Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2899284, response status: 200"
