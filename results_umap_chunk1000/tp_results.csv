The socio-economic collective dispute is currently under examination at the Sixth Labour and Social Insurance Court;- El Estor farm: the dismissed persons were reinstated; a collective agreement is currently under negotiation;- Medelln farm: there is no trade union organization; the farm only contracts temporary staff;- El Salto farm: the trade union has been granted legal personality;- El Trapichito farm and El Naranjo farm: the trade unions have been inactive since 1990 because they have not fulfilled the legal requirement of electing the members of their respective executive committees;- the Trade Union of Bakers of Chiquimula and the Trade Union of Shipping Workers of the Port of Santo Toms de Castilla: no trade union organizations exist at present.\n284.It is with satisfaction that the Committee learned of the peace agreements and, in particular, of the agreement on the definitive cease-fire (4 December 1996), of the global agreement on human rights and of the agreement concerning socio-economic aspects and agriculture which establishes the principles of freedom of association, social dialogue, negotiation and consultation. The Committee likewise notes with interest the establishment of new labour courts, as recommended by the direct contacts mission that visited the country in February 1995. The Committee expresses the sincere hope that civil peace marks the beginning of a new stage in industrial relations.\n285.Nevertheless, the Committee emphasizes that the return to normality in industrial relations must go hand in hand with the elucidation of all acts of violence against trade unionists as alleged in the cases currently under consideration by means of the initiation of judicial inquiries so that responsibilities can be determined and the guilty parties punished. The complainant organizations also have a collaborating role to play in this task, and in this connection the Committee regrets that they have not sent the information it had requested of them.\n286.The Committee notes the decision of the Tripartite Committee for International Affairs to set up a working party to investigate the allegations. It hopes that the working party will be able to respond to all the allegations, and counts on the collaboration of the trade unions. The Committee notes the readiness of the authorities to try to elucidate the allegations, although, according to the Government, many of the events occurred a number of years ago; in some cases the complainants have provided very little information, and in others they have made denunciations to the national authorities.\n287.More specifically, the Committee notes the initiation or continuation of judicial inquiries into the death of the trade unionists Petrolino Hernndez Vasilio (proceedings halted for lack of evidence), Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, Alexnder Giovanni Gmez Virula, Adrin Miranda Prez and Belisario Lpez Rojas, the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vzquez, the abduction of and attacks against Edi Antonio Conde Lu, and the abduction of Ivo Adilio Garca Rivera and Crisanto Garca Alonzo. The Committee observes that, according to the information sent by the Government, the death of Nstor Ren Osorio is not linked to causes of a trade union nature (but to civil problems related to land tenure), and neither is the arrest and prosecution of Otto Ivn Rodrguez Venegas (car theft), nor the alleged attacks against Mr. Ernesto Bol (he was knocked over in a state of drunkenness by a vehicle), nor the arrest of Mr. Cndido Luis Toj (he took part in the lynching of a foreman at the Nueva California farm, who was assassinated). With respect to the imprisonment of Mr. Rubn Terry Amzquita, according to the Government he left the country and went into exile. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more details on the allegation relating to the death of Edwin Giovanni Hidalgo (according to the Government he was neither a worker nor a trade union leader at the National Electrification Institute, and therefore additional information is required to confirm his death) as well as on other, too general allegations indicated in the annex to this report.\n288.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided information on the remaining allegations of acts of violence against the trade unionists (see the annexed list of pending allegations) and requests it to do so urgently, making sure that judicial inquiries have been initiated, and to keep it informed in this connection.\n289.The Committee observes furthermore that the judicial proceedings brought in relation to acts of violence against trade unionists, to which the Government has referred, do not seem in general to have been concluded nor to have allowed the guilty parties to be identified and punished. In this connection, the Committee stresses that the absence of sentences against the guilty parties involves a de facto impunity which aggravates the climate of violence and insecurity, and that this is extremely detrimental to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee expresses the hope that the judicial inquiries under way and those that are to be initiated will put an end to the situation of impunity which has existed up until now.\n290.The Committee also requests the Government to send observations on the allegations of the ICFTU (27 June 1996) and of the CLAT (4 October 1996) concerning the assassination of Luis Armando Bravo Prez, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Customs Workers, the attempted assassination of Sixto Prez Coche, Financial Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the La Patria Farm and the following of the trade union leader Jos Antonio Garca by an armed individual. Furthermore, the Committee repeats its request for information on developments in the inquiries relating to the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax, Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar, Camilo Ajqui, to the arrest of trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Roland Pastor and Francisco Pastor, and to the abduction of Walter Njera Molina, who was released.\n291.As regards the pending allegations concerning acts of trade union discrimination, the Committee notes that the judicial authorities denied the request for the reinstatement of a number of members of the Trade Union of the Nueva California farm but that in the', ""The Committee hopes that a regional technical commission will be able to set off shortly to the country, in order to speed up the clarification of the allegations under review.(e) The Committee asks the Government to continue to keep it informed about the investigations into the alleged surveillance of the IUF premises by persons unknown on 23 August 1993.(f) With regard to the allegations relating to acts of discrimination (International Textile Corporation enterprise, El Salto farm, Mariposa S.A. bottling enterprise and Las Delicias farm), the Committee stresses the importance of remedying all the acts of anti-union discrimination and asks the Government to keep it informed of the progress of these procedures. The Committee also asks the Government to send information as to the status of the legal proceedings regarding the dismissal of various officers of the Workers' Union of the San Juan de Dios Hospital.Recent allegations(g) Finally, the Committee asks the Government to send its observations on the additional information submitted by the ICFTU, dated 18 July 1997.\n277.At its June 1996 meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the pending allegations (see 304th Report, para. 320):(a) As at its previous meeting, the Committee once again deeply regrets the violent deaths of trade union officials and trade unionists, as well as the disappearances, abductions, arbitrary arrests and assaults and expresses its deep concern at the situation of impunity (only in a few cases have the authors been identified) and insists on the absolute need for judicial inquiries to be opened on all cases pending before the Committee with a view to clarifying the facts and punishing the guilty parties. In this respect, the Committee recalls the commitment made by the Attorney-General of the Republic to open investigations on all the cases presented to the Committee and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee expresses its deep concern that new allegations have been made concerning assassinations and acts of violence against trade unionists in 1995.(b) Although it takes note of the efforts by the Government to provide information on the alleged deaths and other acts of violence, the Committee urges it to continue sending information on the investigations mentioned in its conclusions (death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax, Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar - the responsible official was placed before the competent court, Camilo Ajqui - who the Government denies as a unionist, Adrin Miranda and Velizario Lpez Rojas; arrests of the trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Rolando Pastor and Francisco Pastor - which resulted in the dismissal of a captain; the abduction of Walter Njera Molina - who was released; the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vsquez Lpez; and the attacks against Ernesto Bol) and on those concerning the list of allegations appearing in the annex and to take the necessary measures to determine the whereabouts of those who have disappeared (reproduced below is the list of allegations that appeared in the annex to the 304th Report).Assassinations of trade unionists- Tyron Francisco Segastume, Trade Union of Workers of the Coca-Cola bottling enterprise, (STETCSA), in February 1990;- Nstor Ren Osorio Sandoval, Trade Union of Electricity Workers (STINDE), in March 1990;- Petronila Hernndez Vasilio, secretary responsible for organization of the Trade Union of Independent Agricultural Workers of La Reformita (Moyuta, Jutiapa), in July 1990;- Rujunel Junam (CERJ), on 14 April 1991;- Edwin Giovanni Hidalgo Jerez (member of STINDE), in August 1991;- at its meeting in November 1992, referring to the murder of a worker on 5 August 1989 during a labour dispute at the La Patria farm, the Committee requested as a matter of urgency the opening of a judicial inquiry to clarify the facts and punish the guilty parties and for it to be kept informed of developments in this respect;- Ivo Adio Garca Rivera, leader of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers, in August 1995;- Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, leader of STINDE, in July 1995.Disappearances, abductions, assaults and arrests of trade unionists- the grenade attack on the home of Edgar Snchez Velsquez (rural worker), and his subsequent arrest on 21 April 1990;- the attempted abduction of Filiberto Ramrez (member of the Trade Union of Workers of the TIPIC S.A. enterprise), on 28 May 1990;- the physical assault of and death threats against Ramon Jacom Pinto (General Secretary of the STIGGS), on 6 February 1991;- the abduction and physical assault of Aura Violeta Flores Acevedo, member of the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of Culture and Sports (SITRACUDE), on 21 March 1991;- the armed attack against Fernando Lucero and Luis Ramrez (SITRACUDE activists), on 20 March 1991;- the arrest, physical assault of and criminal proceedings against Otto Ivn Rodrguez Vanegas (former General Secretary of STINDE), on 5 April 1991;- the abduction and subsequent arrest of Jos Vidal Pamal Tuchn (General Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the Psychiatric Hospital), on 30 May 1991;- the attempted abduction and death threats which forced Dora Arriaza, leader of the Trade Union Federation of Public Employees (FENASTEG), into exile, on 14 May 1991;- the attempted abduction of Yolanda Figueroa (official of the Trade Union of Customs Officers), and her two daughters, on 21 June 1991;- the abduction, death threats and physical assault of Wosveli Castro, General Secretary of the Federation of Trade Unions in the Metal Trades (FETRAMEGUA), on 16 May 1991;- the death threats and physical assault of Rosendo de Len Dubn, official of the National Press Trade Union (STN);- the abduction and subsequent disappearance of Felipe Lpez Mendoza (member of CERJ), in June 1991;- the physical attack against a member of FESINTROP, on 14 February 1991;- the abduction of Mr. Edi Antonio Conde Lu, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers and secretary responsible for organization of the Confederation of Trade Union Unity of Guatemala (CUSG) on 8 September 1994; subsequently he was brutally beaten, received death threats and had to flee the country;- in the ESDEE Guatemala maquila enterprise, members of the trade union received"", ""works;- as concerns the MK S.A. and L&L S.A. enterprises, the respective judges have not yet handed down their judgements;- as concerns the refusal by the National Committee for the Blind and Deaf Mutes of Guatemala, the judicial proceedings have not yet been concluded;- as concerns the Unicasa S.A. and Welly S.A. enterprises, the General Labour Inspectorate initiated a penal trial before the judicial authority which is still pending;- the reinstatement of the workers on the El Salto farm continues to be discussed in the tribunals;- as concerns the Bolivia farm, thanks to a commission made up of various authorities and established at the request of the Popular Workers' Federation, an agreement has been arrived at in which the parties withdrew the judicial action initiated;- as concerns the alleged refusal to negotiate in the Los Angeles farm, a collective agreement was made on 9 October 1994 with the intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate;- as concerns the La Argentina farm, no denunciations were presented;- as concerns the Diseos y Maquilas S.A. enterprise, the industrial dispute was resolved with the making of a collective agreement.\n313.In their communication of July 1995, the IUF and the ICFTU state that Mrs. Flor de Mara Salguero de Laparra, a trade unionist of the Trade Union Federation of Food, Agro-Industry and Related Workers (FESTRAS), a trade union organization in the maquila sector, received death threats in 1995; on 17 May 1995 she was abducted, drugged, beaten and raped; after her release she received further intimidating telephone calls recalling the assault against her on 17 May.\n314.In its communications of July, October and December 1995, the ICFTU indicates that in the middle of March 1995, Mr. Alexander Yovany Gmez Virula, a leader of the trade union in the RCA enterprise, was assassinated. Mr. Ivo Adio Garca Rivera, an official of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers was abducted and freed the following day after being submitted to severe psychological pressure and that these events were related to a work stoppage in August 1995. Furthermore, the ICFTU alleges the assassination of Mr. Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, an official of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Electrification Institute on 23 July 1995, which the trade union says was the result of his trade union activities. Further threats were also made against the trade unionist Dbora Guzmn and against the child which she was expecting, to make her force her husband, Flix Hernndez, an official of the Lunafil Trade Union, to leave the trade union. The ICFTU adds also that Mr. Ernesto Bol, an official of the Trade Union of the Workers of the City of Coban was severely beaten and insulted on 9 November 1995 by unknown people; furthermore it was not possible for him to be reinstated in his post even with the existence of a judicial order to this effect.\n315.Finally, the ICFTU alleges that in the Las Delicias farm, in Retalhuleu, which belongs to the Good Year S.A. Rubber Plantations multinational enterprise, attempts have been made for many years to destroy the Trade Union of Rubber Plantation Workers in the Las Delicias farm through radical anti-union measures designed to intimidate workers, such as the systematic dismissal of workers who were trade union members, violations of the fundamental right to engage in collective bargaining (the enterprise has appointed a group of non-unionized workers to represent all the workers) and the unacceptable measures of reprisal taken by the enterprise, such as the closing down of the school and clinic which depend on the enterprise and the recent refusal to pay wages for the last two months to unionized workers.\n316.The Committee notes the willingness of the Government to reply to all the allegations and the extensive report of the Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Executive Policy on Human Rights and observes that it contains some information on most of the pending allegations concerning deaths, disappearances, acts of violence against trade unionists and anti-union dismissals. The Committee notes that proceedings or investigations have been initiated concerning the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax and Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar (the responsible official was placed before the competent court), Camilo Ajqui Gimon (who the Government denies as a unionist), Adrin Miranda Lpez and Velizario Lpez Rojas, the arrests of the trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Rolando Pastor and Francisco Pastor (which resulted in the dismissal of a captain), the abduction of Walter Njera Molina (who was released), the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vsquez Lpez and the attacks against Ernesto Bol. However, the Committee deeply regrets that the information supplied by the Government gives no indication that significant progress has been made in the investigations of the numerous cases of alleged violence. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also notes the information from the Government categorically denying the alleged police repression of strikers at the Social Security Institute on 11 February 1991 (no force was used and the police presence was confined to guaranteeing freedom to work), and that the detention of officials of the STIGSS during a strike was for a short period and due to the unlawful seizure of vehicles, and that the guilty parties were fined by the magistrates court; the Government also denies that there has been any detention or arrest of trade unionists in the Mahler y Sucesoras enterprise on 12 March 1993 and states that there was only a meeting held during working time and which resulted in the signing of documents in an agreement reached between the parties on the existing labour dispute.\n317.The Committee notes that the Government requests clarification from the complainants on the following allegations: the death of Messrs. Jos Mara Incuyat, Julio Csar Prez and Pedro Genovevo Escobar, the armed attack against Mr. Victor Alfredo Chacoj and the attacks against Werner Coc Ramrez. The Committee therefore requests the complainants to provide the information available to them on these allegations to enable the Government to reply.\n318.As regards the""]"

They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article 2 of Convention No. 87.\n58.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 35th Session (1952). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.\n4.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions\n59.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. 22/78 of 18 October 1978, repealed resolutions of 1973 which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section 356 of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article 4 of Convention no. 87, which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers\' and employers\' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.\n60.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section 350 of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.\n5.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises\n61.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. 13/74 of 21 October 1974, issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration\'s opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its 186th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.\n62.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.\n63.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores\' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN).

In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary', ""can only enter the establishments in which they work);' obstacles to posting trade union announcements in workplaces, thereby interfering with the announcement of assemblies and other meetings organized by the union;' undue delays in communications with the ISSS administration, and the institutional representatives with decision-making powers, with a view to resolving collective disputes affecting the interests of doctors; this has occurred on a number of occasions leading to the suspension of meetings of the high-level round table set up with the ISSS to address socio-economic grievances, and to resolve labour disputes;' refusal to give union officials the information they need to carry out their duties, such as job descriptions, financial statements, institutional agreements, etc.;' the ISSS illegally withholds the union dues of members of the complainant union.\n216.Lastly, the complainant alleges restrictions to trade union activities through anti-union instructions that the ISSS Deputy Director for Health circulated among the directors and the management of the local medical centres, in a memorandum dated 11 April 2013 entitled  administrative instructions'  containing a series of mandatory instructions aiming to prevent trade union activities. The contents of those instructions have the following effects:' they do not allow time for the trade unions to present situations or problems related to trade union activities in the administrative meetings held in the medical centres and attended by the doctors working in those centres;' they require the directors and management to report cases of dereliction of duty by staff under their authority, thereby seeking to prevent both the members of the executive board and the local trade union representatives from meeting workers to give them information on trade union objectives and provide the respective guidance on the trade union s operations, which does not, of course, prejudice the effective operation of health services given the brevity of those meetings. Furthermore, they require the Head of the Security Department to be informed of incidents affecting the proper operation of the workplace, thereby seeking to suppress the defence of just and legitimate grievances by the trade union through peaceful means of pressure not affecting patients;' they prevent contact between union representatives and the media by designating the communications officer as the only person authorized to deal with consultations and requests for interviews from the press. This restricts the freedom of expression and, worse still, violates citizens' right to receive accurate information regarding the situation of the ISSS health services.\n217.The complainant indicates that, in line with this approach, the ISSS management has sought to threaten the medical staff with disciplinary sanctions for supporting public complaints and means of pressure of the trade union, as was the case on 11 April 2013, when the director of the specialized treatment hospital circulated instructions to the management of that centre to threaten doctors participating in activities organized by the trade union with sanctions.\n218.SIMETRISSS requests that Conventions Nos 87, 98 and 135 and Recommendation No. 143 be respected.\n219.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaints, the Government has not sent the requested information, even though the Committee requested it to do so through an urgent appeal at its March 2014 meeting. The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.\n220.Hence, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see 127th Report, para. 17, approved by the Governing Body], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.\n221.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of the allegations of violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect for trade union rights in law and in practice. The Committee is confident that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations brought against them.\n222.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant alleges that: (1) the ISSS administration refuses to bargain with the complainant union on an agreement to adjust doctors' wages, which have been frozen for over 12 years, on the grounds that, in accordance with the Labour Code, it can only bargain with the trade union holding the bargaining rights within the ISSS, and it persists in ignoring an agreement that it signed in 1998 with the complainant union, which would increase doctors' wages through the payment of three instalments; and (2) it refuses to provide trade union facilities and, in particular, to provide the union officials with the information that they need to carry out their duties, to provide paid union leave for the members of the executive board of the complainant union, as well as preventing union announcements from being posted in workplaces; the ISSS illegally withholds the union dues of the members of the complainant union and prevents communication with trade union representatives, suspending on a number of occasions the meetings of the high-level round table to address labour grievances and resolve disputes.\n223.The Committee observes that part of the problems raised in this case concern the refusal of the right to bargain collectively and trade union facilities for a minority trade union of doctors, while the ISSS majority trade union has signed a collective agreement which applies to everyone given that the trade union represents at least 51 per cent of the workers.\n224.In this regard, the Committee wishes to highlight the following principles [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, paras 346 and 359]:' The Committee has pointed out on several occasions, and particularly during discussion on the draft of the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, that the International Labour Conference referred to the question of the representative character of trade unions, and, to a certain extent, it agreed to the distinction that is sometimes made between the various unions concerned according to how representative they are.

Moreover, taking into account the nature of the allegations and that it was mentioned in the report of the last direct contacts mission that the Public Defender in his 1996 report to Congress affirmed that ""there are still people in the armed forces and police who commit illegal and arbitrary acts in the course of their military and police activities"" and ""today thousands of Colombians are still terrorized by paramilitary groups"" (see 306th Report, p.85 of the English version), the Committee, observing that the situation has not improved since that time, condemns the progressive deterioration of the situation and points out that it is the responsibility of the Government to guarantee the correct comportment of its security forces which, in any event and at all times, must respect human rights.\n283.Similarly, the Committee notes with deep concern that the acts of violence against trade union officials and members have extended to persons close to them, by reason either of family ties, or of their professional activities. In this regard, the Committee deeply regrets the murder of Dr. Jos Uma a Mendoza on 18 April 1998 in the city of Bogot. Dr. Uma a Mendoza was the defence attorney of the officials and members of the Workers\' Trade Union (USO), some of whom feature on the list of persons in detention appearing in the annex to this report. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to put an end to all acts of violence against trade union officials and members and those close to them.\n284.The Committee emphasizes that ""the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and members requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and on the circumstances in which they occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events"", and that ""the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, 4th edition, 1996, paras. 51 and 55).Allegations of acts of violence regarding which investigations have been instituted\n285.Regarding the allegations pending after examination of the case in the March 1998 version, the Committee notes that the Government states that judicial investigations have been initiated in connection with the following cases: Aurelio Arbelez (murdered on 4 March 1997); Guillermo Asprilla (murdered on 23 July 1997); Flix Avils Arroyo (murdered on 1 December 1997); Juan Camacho Herrera (murdered on 25 April 1997); Luis Orlando Camao Galvis (murdered on 20 July 1997); Hernando Cuadros (murdered in 1994); Freddy Francisco Fuentes Paternina (murdered on 18 July 1997); Nstor Eduardo Galindo (murdered on 6 March 1997); Vctor Julio Garzn (murdered on 7 March 1997); Isidro Segundo Gil Gil (murdered on 9 December 1996); Jos Silvio Gmez (murdered on 1 April 1996); Enoc Mendoza Riasco (murdered on 7 April 1997); Carlos Arturo Moreno (murdered on 7 June 1995); Luis Orlando Quiceno Lpez (murdered on 16 July 1997); Nazareno de Jess Rivera (murdered on 12 March 1997); Arnold Enrique Snchez Maza (murdered on 13 July 1997); Camilo Surez Ariza (murdered on 21 July 1997); Mauricio Tapias Llerena (murdered on 21 July 1997); Atilio Jos Vsquez (murdered in July 1997; while the complainant organization lists him as disappeared, the Government includes him on the list of murder victims); Luis Abel Villa Len (murdered on 21 July 1997); Odulfo Zambrano Lpez (murdered on 27 October 1997); Pedro Acosta Uparela (disappeared on 28 December 1996); Rodrigo Rodrguez Sierra (disappeared on 16 February 1995); Alvaro Taborda (disappeared on 8 January 1997).

Detentions: Edgar Riao, Marcelino Buitrazo, Felipe Mendoza, Monarge Snchez, Guillermo Crdenas, Rafael Estupin, Hernn Vallejos, Luis Rodrigo Carreo, Leonardo Mosquera, Fabio Livano, Csar Carrillo. The Committee expresses its deep concern over these acts of violence and murders and condemns them. It requests the Government to keep it informed, as a matter of urgency, of the judicial investigations and proceedings under way.\n286.Likewise, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigations under way, as stated during the previous meeting of the Committee (March 1998), in connection with murders, disappearances and death threats against the following trade union officials and members: Murders: Antonio Moreno (12 August 1995);

Jorge Boada Palencia (murdered on 18 April 1998); Jorge Duarte Chvez (murdered in Barrancabermeja on 9 May 1998); Carlos Rodrguez Mrquez (murdered on 10 May 1998); Arcngel Rubio Ramrez Giraldo; Orfa Ligia Meja (murdered on 7 October 1998); Macario Herrera Villota; Vctor Eloy Mieles Ospino and Rosa Ramrez; attempted murders: Virgilio Ochoa Prez; Eugeniano Snchez; Benito Rueda Villamizar. The Committee expresses its grave concern and repudiates these acts and requests the Government to keep it informed as a matter of urgency on the results of the investigations and prosecutions under way.\n102.Concerning the allegations of the attempted murders of the trade union leaders Tarcisio Mora, Jess Antonio Gonzlez Luna and Jos Domingo Tovar Arrieta, the Committee notes that the Government refutes the allegations of these incidents and denies, in the three cases, that such attacks took place, presenting police reports which support its position.Recent acts of violence concerning which the Government is awaiting information\n103.As concerns the alleged murders of trade union leaders and members regarding which the Government reports that it is awaiting specific information from the Office of the Procurator-General (Oscar Artunduaga Nuez, Jess Orlando Arvalo, Moiss Canedo Estrada, Gladys Pulido Monroy, Oscar David Calandn Gonzales, Oswaldo Rojas, Julio Alfonso Poveda, Pedro Alejandrino Melchor Tapasco and Manuel Avila Ruiz), the Committee notes that concerning Jess Orlando Arvalo, Julio Alfonso Poveda, Vctor Eloy Mieles Ospino and Rosa Ramrez, the Government discounts any connection between the murders and the trade union activities of the deceased. In order to be able to pronounce itself in this regard, the Committee urges the Government without delay to ensure that investigations have been opened and to keep it informed in this respect.Acts of violence into which the investigations have been adjourned\n104.Concerning the eight murder cases where the investigations have been adjourned by the competent Procurator\'s Office (Ernesto Emilio Fernndez Pezter, murdered on 20 November 1995; Libardo Antonio Acevedo, murdered on 7 July 1996; Magaly Pearanda, murdered on 27 July 1997; David Quintero Uribe, murdered on 7 August 1997; Aurelio Arbelez, murdered on 4 March 1997; Jos Guillermo Asprilla Torres, murdered on 23 July 1997; Carlos Arturo Moreno Lpez, murdered', 'or omission vis--vis those groups and the violation of human rights in general that this entails, the Committee requests the Government to order an urgent and global inquiry into these practices at the institutional level, with a view to imposing appropriate sanctions. The Committee further requests the Government to take radical and systematic steps to disband the self-defence groups wherever they operate and to neutralize and punish all their leaders, members and financial backers, especially in the case of the United Self-Defence Units of Colombia whose disbanding shows no sign of having made any real progress. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of developments;- regarding the protection of trade union officials, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to increase the budgetary allocation that it has earmarked for a programme of protection of trade union officials and, in consultation with the trade union organizations, to adopt additional measures to protect the life of trade union officials who have been threatened;- regarding the matter of impunity, the Committee, noting with concern that, as far as the material and moral perpetrators of the murders of trade union officials and members are concerned, the outcome of the procedures in terms of convictions is virtually nil and that only in exceptional cases are the facts clarified, the culprits identified and the full rigour of the law applied, requests the Government to make a substantial effort to combat the extremely serious and intolerable situation of impunity, which is one of the main reasons for the violence, and to keep it informed of developments;- regarding the alleged acts of violence against trade union officials and members (murders, disappearances, physical aggression, kidnappings and death threats) listed in the annex to this report, which the Government states are being investigated and on which it will inform the Committee of developments, the Committee, while expressing its concern and deeply regretting all these incidents, requests the Government to keep it informed of the findings of all the inquiries currently in progress (a copy of the annex follows).Annex1.Murders, attempted murders, physical aggression,disappearances and detentionsMurders(1) Antonio Moreno Asprilla (12 August 1995); (2) Manuel Ballesta Alvarez (13 August 1995); (3) Francisco Mosquera Crdoba (5 February 1996); (4) Carlos Antonio Arroyo (5 February 1996); (5) Francisco Antonio Usuga (23 February 1996); (6) Pedro Luis Bermdez Jaramillo (6 June 1995); (7) Armando Humanes Petro (23 May 1996); (8) William Gustavo Jaimes Torres (28 August 1995); (9) Jaime Elicer Ojeda (23 May 1994); (10) Alfonso Noguera Cano (4 November 1994); (11) Alvaro Hoyos Pabn (12 December 1995); (12) Nstor Eduardo Galndo Rodrguez (3 July 1997); (13) Erieleth Barn Daza (3 May 1997); (14) Jhon Freddy Arboleda Aguirre (3 July 1997); (15) William Alonso Surez Gil (3 July 1997); (16) Eladio de Jess Chaverra Rodrguez (3 July 1997); (17) Luis Carlos Muoz Z.

The enterprise states that the Supreme Court found firstly that, in accordance with the democratic principles recognized by the Political Constitution and by the ILO supervisory bodies, the ACDAC had not obtained the majority required by section 444 of the Substantive Labour Code to be able to hold a strike. The enterprise indicates in this respect that: (i) without prejudice to the consideration of the ACDAC as an industry- or occupation-based trade union, the democratic principles on strike ballots set down in section 444 of the Substantive Labour Code should be respected; (ii) the actions of the ACDAC during the strike ballot demonstrate that it recognizes that it is a minority union because, according to the minutes of its meetings, it called on the other trade unions in the enterprise to approve the strike action with the aim of obtaining a majority ballot among all the enterprise s workers; (iii) notwithstanding this, in the end, the ACDAC held the ballot in a members-only meeting room, without the members of the other trade unions casting a ballot, preventing the participation of non-unionized workers despite their request to take part, and without accepting the findings of the labour inspector to guarantee the validity of the results; and (iv) as a result, only 279 of the enterprise s 8,624 workers voted in favour of the strike.\n190.The enterprise further states that the Supreme Court, in its examination of the legality of the strike, also considered that, in the Colombian context, air transport constitutes an essential public service because it: (i) ensures the supply of goods and services, thereby guaranteeing fundamental rights such as health and education; (ii) allows the transfer of patients and medical supplies to guarantee the right to life and health of the population; and (iii) even enables humanitarian assistance services to be provided to populations that are remote and disconnected from the national territory and guarantees the connectivity of marginalized or remote regions, which do not have other transport alternatives. The enterprise provides as examples the island of San Andres and the city of Leticia where, owing to the geographical conditions, air transport is the main and almost only means of supplying food and medicines, as well ensuring the movement of people. The enterprise also refers to the declaration of the Governor of the Department of Caldas, cited in the ruling of the Supreme Court, in which he expresses his concern over the consequences of the cessation of activities for the region   remaining completely isolated from the rest of the country  ? In respect of the above, the enterprise provides the following figures: owing to Colombia s economic situation and infrastructure, the enterprise provides 48 per cent of passenger transport, the provision of 80 per cent of food supplies to the Department of San Andres, Providencia and', 'electrical workers, and when the workers carried out peaceful protests, penalties were imposed on trade union leaders and workers in various locations;- article 50 of the National Constitution recognizes the right to strike, except in essential public services. Since the necessary regulations have not been adopted to give effect to the Constitution, the Government has assumed the right to decide which services are ""essential"". Trade union leaders, activists and workers have been dismissed on the basis of the ""illegality"" of work stoppages; this has affected the following numbers of workers: Colombian Port Authority, 8,000; Bogot Electrical Energy Enterprise, 20; Atlantic Electric Company, 18; Atlantic Coast Electric Corporation, 15; Guavio Hydroelectric Company, 200; Banco Popular, 31; Banco Cafetalero, 27; AVIANCA, 48.\n237.In its communication of 2 August 1993 the ICFTU denounces the following acts of violence committed against trade union leaders and trade unionists. Murders: Gustavo and Ivn Bedoya of COLCARBURO in April 1993; Jelo Parra, a worker at the Nare Cements enterprise on 20 May 1993; Orlando Gaviria on 20 May 1993; Mr. Luis Carlos Prez, the President of the Federation of Transport Workers (FEDETRANS), in the Fontibn district in Bogot on 25 June 1993; Hernando Valencia Laso, a member of the national executive of the Union of State Workers of Colombia (UTRADEC), on 30 June 1993. Kidnapping attempts and detention: on 29 March 1993 two unidentified persons attempted to kidnap Mrs. Teresa Montes Ovalle; on 30 April 1993 three unknown people attempted to kidnap the son of Mrs. Teresa Montes, Javier Enrique Burgos; in April 1993 Mrs. Teresa Montes was illegally interrogated by two men who said they belonged to the Technical Corp of the Special Prosecution\'s Office; on 29 June 1993 in the town of Duitama, soldiers of the Silva Plazas Battalion stopped Mr. Jos Joaqun Montes Ovalle\'s vehicle, in which he was travelling with the daughters of Yolanda and Teresa Montes; they were detained for four hours.\n238.In its communication of 28 October 1993 the ICFTU reports that Mr. Jairo Alivio Serrano Rincn (of the national and local directorate of the National Trade Union of Workers of Bavaria) was murdered in September 1993. Finally, the ICFTU reiterates several allegations which were already presented in the framework of Cases Nos. 1620 and 1625, and already examined by the Committee.\n239.In its communication of 16 September 1993 the Government states that the right of freedom of association is established in section 38 of Act No. 50 of 1990: ""Workers and employers have the right, without prior authorization, to form organizations as they see fit, and to join such organizations, on condition only that they observe their by-laws"". Article 39.2 of the National Constitution establishes that: ""the internal structure and functioning of trade unions and social and occupational organizations shall be subject to the law and shall respect the principles of democracy"". Section 45 of Act No. 50 outlines the requirements which must be fulfilled by each trade union in respect of the law, and section 44 stipulates that: ""any trade union is a legal entity by virtue of its very establishment, as from the date of its constitutent assembly"".\n240.As regards infringements of the right of freedom of association, they are defined as criminal acts and punished in accordance with the detailed provisions of section 39 of Act No. 50 of 1990. They may also give rise to administrative sanctions. The right to freedom of association is now enshrined in the Constitution; through Act No. 50 of 1990, the State has established more effective machinery to ensure the prompt settlement of disputes. Furthermore, the Ministry ensures the right to collective bargaining, facilitating the quick settlement of disputes by intervening when requested to do so by the parties, by convening arbitration courts when called for by law, or by imposing the appropriate penalties on enterprises refusing to enter into a dialogue when claims and demands are filed in due form. In 1993 (through June) 65 new trade union organizations came into existence and 224 collective agreements were signed.

As regards the allegation of a massacre of 24 workers on 24 January 1992 in Barrancabermeja, the Government is certain that this incident did not take place.\n243.On the other hand, the Government also reports that the following cases are not included in the Ministry of Labour\'s registry: Luis Eduardo Padilla, Tefilo Carrillo, David Osuna; 9 July 1992 seven farmworkers', 'electrical workers, and when the workers carried out peaceful protests, penalties were imposed on trade union leaders and workers in various locations;- article 50 of the National Constitution recognizes the right to strike, except in essential public services.

Murders: Gustavo and Ivn Bedoya of COLCARBURO in April 1993; Jelo Parra, a worker at the Nare Cements enterprise on 20 May 1993; Orlando Gaviria on 20 May 1993; Mr. Luis Carlos Prez, the President of the Federation of Transport Workers (FEDETRANS), in the Fontibn district in Bogot on 25 June 1993; Hernando Valencia Laso, a member of the national executive of the Union of State Workers of Colombia (UTRADEC), on 30 June 1993. Kidnapping attempts and detention: on 29 March 1993 two unidentified persons attempted to kidnap Mrs. Teresa Montes Ovalle; on 30 April 1993 three unknown people attempted to kidnap the son of Mrs. Teresa Montes, Javier Enrique Burgos; in April 1993 Mrs. Teresa Montes was illegally interrogated by two men who said they belonged to the Technical Corp of the Special Prosecution\'s Office; on 29 June 1993 in the town of Duitama, soldiers of the Silva Plazas Battalion stopped Mr. Jos Joaqun Montes Ovalle\'s vehicle, in which he was travelling with the daughters of Yolanda and Teresa Montes; they were detained for four hours.\n238.In its communication of 28 October 1993 the ICFTU reports that Mr. Jairo Alivio Serrano Rincn (of the national and local directorate of the National Trade Union of Workers of Bavaria) was murdered in September 1993. Finally, the ICFTU reiterates several allegations which were already presented in the framework of Cases Nos. 1620 and 1625, and already examined by the Committee.\n239.In its communication of 16 September 1993 the Government states that the right of freedom of association is established in section 38 of Act No. 50 of 1990: ""Workers and employers have the right, without prior authorization, to form organizations as they see fit, and to join such organizations, on condition only that they observe their by-laws"". Article 39.2 of the National Constitution establishes that: ""the internal structure and functioning of trade unions and social and occupational organizations shall be subject to the law and shall respect the principles of democracy"". Section 45 of Act No. 50 outlines the requirements which must be fulfilled by each trade union in respect of the law, and section 44 stipulates that: ""any trade union is a legal entity by virtue of its very establishment, as from the date of its constitutent assembly"".\n240.As regards infringements of the right of freedom of association, they are defined as criminal acts and punished in accordance with the detailed provisions of section 39 of Act No. 50 of 1990. They may also give rise to administrative sanctions. The right to freedom of association is now enshrined in the Constitution; through Act No. 50 of 1990, the State has established more effective machinery to ensure the prompt settlement of disputes.

Hence it has been possible to create an automated mechanism for the minimum salary, something that was provided for by law more than ten years ago but which has never been done in practice. It adds that the amparo action Argentine Teachers?Federation v. Ministry of Education and Sport et al.?(Case No. 19774/2017) produced a ruling which rejected the claim brought by the union (Labour Court No. 60).\n107.With regard to the allegations concerning the Province of Buenos Aires and the recourse to compulsory conciliation, the Government considers that the principal circumstance which gave rise to the order for conciliation was the need to keep schools open because many of them also operate as canteens. However, the dispute has been settled with the adoption of Act No. 5/2017 of 28 June 2017 (Agreement with all teachers and their professional organizations involved in the salary dispute in the Province of Buenos Aires?. Specifically, it is stated that the implementing authority has formally approved by an absolute majority the salary proposal for 2017 presented by the provincial government in the joint negotiation document, in accordance with the terms of Act No. 13552.\n108.With regard to the ARS1,000 bonus, established by the internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action since 6March 2017, the Government indicates that this action was taken with an eye to the resumption of classes, with the aim of giving objective recognition to those who performed their tasks in a clearly extraordinary context, since the strikes were carried out with the pupils inside the classrooms.\n109.With regard to the allegations of a brutal crackdown by the police of Buenos Aires on account of the setting up of a mobile school, the Government has supplied the report of 14February 2018 drawn up by the Secretary for Security of the Ministry of Security and Justice of the city of Buenos Aires, which states that the unions did not comply with the regulations governing the occupation of public spaces and that the police acted in line with the provisions of the Comprehensive Public Security System Act (No. 5688), in particular as regards the proportional use of force.\n110.The Committee observes that Cases Nos 3248, 3257 and 3272 are concerned with similar allegations, namely: (i) the refusal of the national Government to resume collective bargaining with the public education sector (issue of the federal joint negotiation board for education); (ii) the unlawful use of compulsory conciliation in the Province of Buenos Aires; (iii) obstruction of the right to strike of teachers in the private sector in the Province of Mendoza through the loss of a salary component (classroom allowance); (iv) threats against a trade union official; and (v) violations of freedom of association in the Province of Buenos Aires (request for the suspension of official trade union status; restriction of the right to strike; and police crackdown).\n111.The Committee observes that a key element common to the complaints is the complainants?allegation that the public authorities refused to convene the resumption of collective bargaining for addressing the issue of salaries for teachers in the public sector, thereby putting an end to the mechanism of the federal joint negotiation board for education, which had existed since 2007, as regulated by the Education Finance Act (No. 26075) and Decree No. 457/2007. The Committee notes that, according to the information supplied by the complainants, the purpose of the negotiation mechanism, with the involvement of the national teaching unions, was to remove disparities in salaries arising from the transfer of education services to the provinces. The Committee observes that the complainants concur that the Government unilaterally put an end to the social dialogue mechanism provided for in the Education Finance Act and hence failed to meet the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos 98 and 154. The Committee also notes the indication of CTERA in its additional communication of February 2018 that the national Government adopted Decree No. 52/2018 entailing the de facto abolition of the collective bargaining system at the national level in the education sector.\n112.The Committee notes the Governments statement that the central government is not the employer of the teachers and that salary issues are a matter for discussion by the provincial governments. It notes in particular that the Government considers that in view of the tripartite agreement of February 2016 in which a minimum teaching salary was fixed with an automatic adjustment, there is no need for periodic discussions at federal level. The Committee also notes the Governments indications that progress has been made regarding the framework agreement provided for in section 10 of Act No. 26075, making it clear that collective agreements shall come within the competence of the provincial authorities. The Committee notes the Governments indication that no meeting has been held so far for formulating the framework agreement, that the only meetings held had been at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary and that, while acknowledging the difficulty of the task, steps are being taken to establish the framework agreement.\n113.The Committee observes that section 10 of the Education Finance Act (No. 26075) provides that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in conjunction with the Federal Council for Culture and Education and the teaching unions with national representation shall adopt a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d)the teaching career, but that so far the appropriate conditions had not existed for establishing the framework agreement. The Committee understands, from the information provided by the parties, that the federal joint negotiation board for education was designed to be a forum for dialogue on issues relating to work in the education sector, including salary issues.\n114.The Committee observes that in the collective agreement of February 2016 concluded within the federal joint negotiation board an automatic mechanism was agreed upon', 'of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. 1/2015/1757059/2017).\n78.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on 60,000 volunteers to give educational support to the almost 5 million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March 2017, at the start of the 2017 academic year.\n79.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of 3 March 2017 to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos 10149 and 13552. The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.\n80.In its communication dated 10 February 2017, FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No. 8847 and Decree No. 228 of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March 2016 for every employee covered by Act No.4934 and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.\n81.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some 10 to 20 per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.\n82.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January 1992 the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No. 24049 concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of education and salary levels between the provinces with fewer financial resources and other provinces. The complainant indicates that in 2006 the Education Finance Act (No. 26075), among other legal instruments, sought to iron out inequalities and took grievances from the teaching community into consideration. The instruments established by the National Congress included the federal joint negotiation board for education, a national and federal forum in which, with the involvement of the national teachers?unions, including SADOP, conditions of work were regulated and minimum pay for all teachers in the country was agreed on an annual basis, prior to the start of the academic year. In accordance with the Education Finance Act (No. 26075) and Decree No. 457/2007, the federal joint negotiation board for education was formally established through administrative file No.1.243.441/2007 in the register of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, where the records establishing the federal joint negotiation board were signed by the State, currently the Ministry of Education and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and the Federal Council for Culture and Education, representing the education ministries of the provinces and the national trade union organizations.\n83.The complainant emphasizes that, from 2007 to 2016, regular ongoing joint negotiations were held on an annual basis. It maintains that this practice has given rise to a sectoral and administrative custom which produces effects and legal obligations, and so neither the federal Government nor the provincial governments can restrict the federal joint negotiation board. Hence, for the complainant, the decision of the federal Government and initially of a number of provincial governments to nullify the salary negotiations established in the federal joint negotiation board is not an administrative omission whereby nothing was decided despite the request of the national unions; rather, it shows the Governments wish to avoid complying with the Education Finance Act (No. 26075), as though this Act was not in force. The complainant also claims that this is a violation of Act No. 26206, section 67 of which provides that teachers throughout the education system shall have rights and obligations, including with regard to a decent salary and collective bargaining at the national and regional levels, and shall also be covered by the obligations arising from ILO Conventions Nos 98 and 154.\n84.The complainant considers particularly relevant the protective measure issued by the ruling of the National Labour Court, issued on 5 April 2017, which ordered that the federal joint negotiation board for education be constituted; however, the political and ministerial authorities announced publicly on 6 April 2017 that they would appeal against this ruling.\n85.The complainant also denounces the restrictions of the right to strike of teachers represented by SADOP, imposed by internal regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires, in so far as the latter, by a decision of 15 March 2017, provided for a one-off exceptional payment of 1,000Argentine pesos (ARS) not classified as pensionable remuneration for teachers who taught classes on the days of industrial action announced from 6 March 2017 onwards.\n86.In its first communication dated 5', 'of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. 1/2015/1757059/2017).\n78.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on 60,000 volunteers to give educational support to the almost 5 million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March 2017, at the start of the 2017 academic year.\n79.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of 3 March 2017 to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective.

The Committee urges the Government to immediately implement tripartite consultations and indicates that, although some trade union organizations may not wish to take part in tripartite round tables, the Government has a duty to promote tripartite consultations and social dialogue without excluding representative organizations, such as FEDECAMARAS.\n926.The Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, which were endorsed by the Governing Body, and requests it to report thereon. The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges as well the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.\n927.The Committee again requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.\n928.The Committee notes that, in their communication of 27 November 2014, the IOE and FEDECAMARAS state that the Government is still ignoring the recommendations made by the high-level tripartite mission. They also report new violations of Conventions Nos 87 and 98, particularly: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for 12 hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November 2014, of 50 decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee notes these allegations with concern and requests the Government to send complete observations on the matter.\n929.The Committee notes with concern the allegation contained in the recent joint communication from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS, that 15 entrepreneurs from various sectors, including the Chairperson of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals and the Chairperson of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Services, Mr Luis Rodriquez, were detained without due process and in violation of the right of defence, as well as other allegations. The Committee notes the Government s communications of 10 and 12 March 2015 denying attacks on business and stating that there are no criminal proceedings against the two employer leaders mentioned by the complainants, reporting the prosecution of eight enterprise managers for offences of an economic nature, and reporting also that, as regards the eight enterprise managers, the judicial authority has taken measures for their preventive detention or alternative precautionary measures. The Committee requests the Government to complete its response and intends to review the issues raised therein in a detailed manner at its next meeting in May 2015.\n930.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee draws the Government s attention to the importance of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos 87 and 98, which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on 26 February 2008 and the abduction and mistreatment in 2010 of the leaders of that organization, Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed (FEDECAMARAS appealed against the ruling ordering the closure of the case concerning the bomb attack on its headquarters), again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March 2014, in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that"", ""Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops and the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the urgency of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos 87 and 98, which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in 2010 of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to 14 years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on 26 February 2008.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March 2014, in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October 2015, and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of"", ""looting of stores, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee wishes to point out to the Government the importance of strong measures to avoid such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos 87 and 98, ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on 26 February 2008 and the abduction and maltreatment in 2010 of the leaders of that organization, Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz (the last-mentioned sustaining three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed, again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March 2014, in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chair. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meeting held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February 2015, and immediately to implement tripartite consultations.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of 27 November 2014 concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, President of CONINDUSTRIA, for 12 hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, President of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level State officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November 2014, of 50 decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and the observations by the Government of 10 and 12 March 2015 on some of the allegations. The Committee once again requests the Government to complete its response, to indicate the specific allegations against each of the 13 employers or managers from the different sectors who have been detained or placed under precautionary measures by the judicial authorities, and not to limit itself to an indication of the general criminal offences (boycott, hoarding, smuggling, speculation, etc.), and also to provide information on developments in the respective judicial proceedings.

In its communication of 1 February 1993 the UITA alleges that under Decree No. 25.715 on the restructuring and reorganization of the Pesca Per enterprise, article 5 of which provides for the implementation of an incentive programme of voluntary retirement, 1,636 workers and ten union leaders have been dismissed from the company, which then hired new employees. Finally, the Federation of Workers in the Lighting and Power Industry of Peru states that there have been attempts on the life of trade union leaders and specifically it reports the murder, on 3 August 1992, of Mr. Juan Andahua Vergara (National Organizing Secretary of the General Confederation of Workers of Peru, Secretary General of the National Federation of Workers in the Beverages and Soft Drinks Industry, and Organizing Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the Coca-Cola Company).\n454.In its communication of 13 November 1992 the Government, referring to the allegations presented by the CGTP, states that, as regards the right to organize, Supreme Decree No. 009 of 3 May 1961 was amended in December 1990 by Supreme Decree No. 076-90-TR which simplified the registration of trade unions, the object being that workers' organizations should obtain as promptly as possible their legal personality, a measure which is not inconsistent with ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98. The Government points out that, in changing the minimum number of workers required for the formation of a trade union and in prescribing rules concerning the number of members of the committees that are to act as the workers' representatives in collective bargaining at enterprise and sectoral level, Supreme Decree No. 076-90-TR brought the 1961 legislation up to date and into line with the reality of Peru's labour situation. The Government adds that Legislative Decree No. 25593, which deals with collective labour relations, was recently promulgated, enacting rules concerning the rights of unionization and collective bargaining and the right to strike.\n455.With reference to the allegation that the right of collective bargaining is infringed by the promulgation of Supreme Decrees Nos. 057-90-TR, 107-90-PCM, 121-90-PCM, 178-90-PCM and 023-91-TR, the Government states that these Decrees are in keeping with the economic stabilization programme established by the Government for dealing with the severe inflation and recession seriously affecting the various sectors of the formal economy. The Government points out that these are exceptional measures which were enacted by virtue of paragraph 20 of article 211 of the Constitution of Peru, empowering the President of the Republic to order exceptional measures relating to economic and financial matters in cases where the national interest so requires. It explains that intervention by the State is conditional on the absence of agreement between the parties, and that on some occasions its intervention is exceptional by reason of the country's present economic situation, in which case it prescribes measures relating to economic, financial and labour matters which are designed to increase the workers' purchasing power. The recent legislation concerning industrial relations (Legislative Decree No. 25593) and the related regulations approved by Supreme Decree No. 011-92-TR strengthen the collective autonomy of the parties to the employment relationship, particularly of the workers, in such a way that the lack of the State's protection is compensated for, so far as possible, by collective bargaining.\n456.With regard to the right to strike, the Government states that Supreme Decree No. 070-90-TR enacts rules relating to the exercise of this right in essential services and provisions making possible the immediate resumption of work after the end of the strike. While the right to strike is recognized, the Decree provides that the actual carrying out of a strike must not affect the functioning of essential services, defined to mean services the interruption of which may endanger the life, liberty, safety or health of persons, and which demand the performance of a minimum service to avoid these risks. The provision in question did not infringe any right of workers laid down in ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98; on the contrary, by this enactment the Executive intended to forestall labour disputes that might have arisen upon the exhaustion of the direct negotiation. The Government states, lastly, that the legislation concerning collective labour relations and the relevant regulations prescribe rules governing the right to strike, define the terms, specify the conditions to be fulfilled for declaring a strike and the form of the strike, and ensure the continuity of the essential public services to be provided during the strike, thus introducing into Peruvian legislation a comprehensive set of rules on the subject.\n457.In its communication of 23 December 1992, the Government states finally that Legislative Decree No. 757, a law aiming at improving investment in the private sector, was promulgated by virtue of authority delegated by the Congress of the Republic, in conformity with article 188 of the Constitution, in order to create the conditions necessary for increasing private investment in various sectors of production and to eliminate impediments to economic development and to private enterprise. To this end, the Decree provides that collective bargaining or collective agreements may not include negotiated or automatic adjustments linked to prices or to foreign exchange rates. In addition, Legal Decree No. 25.542 provides that the application of mechanisms of salary readjustment established by legal agreement, collective bargaining, custom, or judicial or administrative court rulings shall terminate on 13 December 1991, the date on which Legislative Decree No. 757 comes into force. The Government explains that these legal steps were necessary in the context of a programme of structural reform of the economy undertaken by the Government.\n458.The Committee notes that the present complaints relate to the alleged inconsistency of certain statutory provisions that have entered into force since 1990, in particular Legislative Decree No. 25593 concerning industrial relations, with Conventions Nos."", ""Federation of Municipal Workers, Employees and Labourers of Peru (FTM-Per), in a communication dated 16 May 2014. The National Confederation of Workers of Peru State (CTE-Per) submitted its allegations in communications dated 17 October and 5 December 2014. The National Federation of Judicial Employees of Peru (FNTPJ) submitted its allegations in a communication dated 13 October 2014. Lastly, the Autonomous Workers' Confederation of Peru (CATP) submitted its allegations in a communication dated 26 December 2014.\n630.The Government sent its observations in communications of 7 February, 1 and 24 September, and 1 October 2014.\n631.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151).\n632.In its communication dated 20 March 2012, the FTLF alleges that the National Fund for Financing State Entrepreneurial Activity (FONAFE) establishes ceilings in the wages paid by state electrical companies, which are in line with the budget assigned to state companies limiting the possibilities of negotiating salary increases through collective bargaining.\n633.Furthermore, the FTLF alleges that Resolution No. 284-2011-TR of the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion, dated 23 October 2011, rendered optional arbitration inapplicable and ineffective as a mechanism for resolving lists of demands, since it obliges the arbitrators of collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget. More specifically, the above resolution imposes on the arbitrators the specific weighting criteria referring to the public sector budget, contained in articles 77 and 78 of the Political Constitution and those contained in rulings of the Constitutional Court which endorse the full observance of the budgetary rules.\n634.In its communication dated 7 June 2013, the FTLF alleges that the 58th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year 2013, Act No. 29951, violates the right of collective bargaining, since it prohibits increasing workers' wages through collective bargaining or arbitration awards. The FTLF states that FONAFE must comply with said Act and that, as a result, state electrical companies within FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The FTLF states that, at the beginning of 2013, it took legal protection proceedings against the Act, since it considered that the Act infringes its constitutional right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and that the Ninth Constitutional Court declared the request non-receivable and ordered the case to be closed for good. The complainant organization considers that a ruling of this kind affects the right of collective bargaining.\n635.In its communication dated 28 June 2012, SUTRAIMELCIFOR, as a representative of the workers of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine and Sciences, alleges that the General Administration of the Public Prosecutor s Office excluded it from the scope of a resolution which authorized the Ministry of Economy and Finance to carry out a study so as to determine the wage scales for 2012; and that the Public Prosecutor s Office did not allow it to form part of a commission responsible for proposing and coordinating with the Ministry of Economy and Finance the wage scales of the Public Prosecutor s Office for 2012.\n636.In its communication dated 22 May 2013, the CGTP alleges that the 58th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year 2013, Act No. 29951, violates the right of collective bargaining, since it prohibits increasing workers' wages through collective bargaining. The CGTP considers that the Act in question contravenes the conclusions reached by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its 357th Report on Peru, in which it pointed out that the impossibility of negotiating wage increases on an ongoing basis is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary bargaining enshrined in Convention No. 98.\n637.In its communication dated 23 September 2013, the CGTP alleges that the Civil Service Act, No. 30057, issued in July 2013, violates the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining enshrined in Conventions Nos 87, 98 and 151. In specific terms, the CGTP alleges that: (1) the Act excludes public servants, public managers and trusted servants from collective rights; (2) the Act restricts collective bargaining in all public entities to working conditions only and subjects relating to wages or of economic significance are excluded from negotiation or any other participatory mechanism; (3) the Act infringes the right to strike when allowing public entities to hire, temporarily and directly, the staff necessary to guarantee the provision of the minimum services in essential services and in services vital for the entity to operate, from the beginning of the strike until its actual end. Moreover, the Act does not detail which activities constitute essential services, thereby implying that limitations on the right to strike may be extended beyond the hypothetical cases accepted by the ILO supervisory bodies as characterizing a service as  essential'  and includes the notion of  services indispensable for the entity to operate'  thereby extending the restrictions on this right; and (4) the process of devising the Act has avoided using the mechanism for participation or consultation of workers' organizations.\n638.In its communications dated 9 September 2013, the CTP, SUTSA INIA and FESUTSA allege that the Civil Service Act, No. 30057, denies the right of collective bargaining to public servants with respect to economic conditions and therefore violates the Political Constitution of Peru and also the labour and union rights recognized in Conventions Nos 87, 98 and 151. The complainant organizations state that the Government never consulted the public workers, nor their unions or trade union associations either, and that 36 parliamentary deputies instituted proceedings in July 2013 alleging that the Act in question was unconstitutional. The complainant organizations indicate that the draft budget of Peru, 2014, likewise violates Convention No. 98 since it prohibits all public entities from readjusting or increasing remuneration, bonuses, grants, rewards and benefits of any type.\n639.For its part, in its communication of 16 May 2014, the FTM-Per alleges that Act"", ""2013, the CTP, SUTSA INIA and FESUTSA allege that the Civil Service Act, No. 30057, denies the right of collective bargaining to public servants with respect to economic conditions and therefore violates the Political Constitution of Peru and also the labour and union rights recognized in Conventions Nos 87, 98 and 151. The complainant organizations state that the Government never consulted the public workers, nor their unions or trade union associations either, and that 36 parliamentary deputies instituted proceedings in July 2013 alleging that the Act in question was unconstitutional. The complainant organizations indicate that the draft budget of Peru, 2014, likewise violates Convention No. 98 since it prohibits all public entities from readjusting or increasing remuneration, bonuses, grants, rewards and benefits of any type.\n639.For its part, in its communication of 16 May 2014, the FTM-Per alleges that Act No. 30057: (1) prohibits collective bargaining on wages and includes only changes to working or employment conditions, in accordance with the budgetary and infrastructure possibilities of the entity and the nature of the functions performed therein; (2) adds great difficulties to the bargaining process, given that the list must be approved by the National Civil Service Authority (SERVIR) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and that the agreements have a period of validity of not less than two years; and (3) infringes the right to strike when allowing public entities to hire, temporarily and directly, the staff necessary to guarantee the provision of minimum services in essential services and in services vital for the entity to operate, from the beginning of the strike until its actual end. Finally, the FTM-Per states that although the Act provides that incorporation in the new system of rules provided for by the Act is voluntary, the Act also states that within a maximum period of six years, all sectors ' except those excluded ' will be regulated by Act No. 30057.\n640.In its communication of 25 June 2012, the Government indicates that the Peruvian State respects collective bargaining and that the rules applied by FONAFE do not violate or undermine this right. The Government explains that FONAFE establishes a wage ceiling, in accordance with the budget assigned for state companies so as to be able to implement their operational and strategic plans, and thus make such companies sustainable. The Government emphasizes that FONAFE and companies within its sphere must comply with the provisions of the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year 2013 and that hence the actions or measures taken by FONAFE are carried out or performed on the basis of imperative or public order rules, without infringing any trade union rights.\n641.As regards the allegation by the FTLF that Resolution No. 284-2011-TR of the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion, dated 23 October 2011, rendered optional arbitration inapplicable and ineffective as a mechanism for resolving lists of demands, since it obliges the arbitrators of collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the specific weighting criteria referring to the public sector budget, contained in articles 77 and 78 of the Political Constitution, and those contained in rulings of the Constitutional Court which confirm complete observance of the budgetary rules, the Government states that in Rulings Nos 008-2005-AI/TC and 02566 2012 PA TC, the Constitutional Court made it clear that collective bargaining involving public servants must be done, taking into consideration the constitutional limit according to which the budget must be balanced and fair. The Government underlines that the Constitutional Court does not deny state workers the exercise of the right to collective bargaining, but subjects them to budgetary rules, and that the economic agreements reached must be covered by the budget.\n642.As to the judgment of the Ninth Constitutional Court, referred to by the FTLF, which rejected the request for protection relating to the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year 2013, the Government states that the fact that the judgment was not in favour of the complainant organization is no justification for said ruling affecting in any way the fundamental right to freedom of collective bargaining.\n643.In its communication of 14 September 2012, the Government declares, in relation to the allegations made by SUTRAIMELCIFOR, that the legal advisory office of the Public Prosecutor s Office stated that, in accordance with the General Administrative Procedure Act, the general managerial resolution of the Public Prosecutor s Office, which excluded the complainant organization from its scope, could not be amended and that, although the Public Prosecutor s Office had no obligation to set up a commission to analyse the 2012 wage scales, it decided to form a special commission, in which another trade union participated (the Union of Workers of the Public Prosecutor s Office).\n644.In its communication dated 7 February 2014, in response to the complaint submitted by the CGTP, the Government explains that the workers covered by the Act on the Foundations of Public Sector Administrative Careers and Remuneration, approved by Decree-Law No. 276 of March 1984, only have the right to collective bargaining in relation to working or employment conditions. The Government states that although the right to collective bargaining for public sector workers is not expressly recognized in the Constitution, its recognition stems from the application of Article 7 of Convention No. 151, which has been ratified by Peru and incorporated through article 55 of the Political Constitution of Peru.\n645.The Government indicates that in view of articles 77 and 78 of the Political Constitution of Peru, the budget assigns fairly public resources and the draft budget must be effectively balanced. The Government also states that the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Act, No. 27245, was approved in November 2003, together with the General National Budget System Act, No. 28411, in December 2004, which establish the principles, processes and procedures that regulate the national budget system, in accordance with articles 77 and 78 of the Political Constitution.\n646.Similarly, Act No. 29849 was approved in April 2012 in order to grant labour rights to workers hired on administrative services contracts, and Act""]"

During the discussion a group of 60 heavily armed men, claiming to be members of the state security forces, blocked traffic in the street of Guatemala City next to the CNT headquarters, broke down the door with a jeep, broke up the meeting and arrested 27 trade unionists, who were led in small groups to unknown destinations. The national police claim that they have no knowledge of the whereabouts of these arrested people, whose names are as follows: Ismael Vzquez Ortiz, Orlando Prez and Florentino Gmez Lpez (members of the EGSA workers\' union), Mario Martinez and Luis Rodolfo Bonilla (members of the Foremost dairy workers\' union), Bernardo Marroquin Salazar, Antonio Rodriguez Ramos and Rafael Antonio Aguilar Prez (members of the Kerns Food Products union), Florencia Xocop Chvez, Gonzalo Vzquez, Manuel Snchez and Oscar Salazar (members of the CNT organising Committee), Sonia Furio (member of the BIC union), Irma Prez Osorio and Hilda Carlota Prez Menndez (General Secretary and member respectively of the INDUPLASTIC union), Sara Cabrera Flores (General Secretary of the AGRICASA union).

Miguel Cifuentes, General Secretary of the Tacasa tobacco workers\' union was forced to leave for the same reason in April 1979.\n47.The complainants further allege that by the end of September 1979 the largest central trade union body in the country, the CNT, had lost 21 of its 56 affiliated trade unions as a result of the methods used by the Government and the employers to destroy the trade unions: the adjournment of legal recognition of the unions for months or even years; occupation by the armed forces of factories, the employers being able to hire soldiers; the creation of (""amarillos"") trade unions dominated by factory owners; the artificial closure of factories later opened again under', 'workers\' union and wounded four workers who were biding the body of the General Secretary of the union, who had just been shot dead.- Finally, the 18 persons arrested on 29 April 1980 in the offices of the CNT, when preparing placards for 1 May (this was referred to in Case No. 957), were released on 2 May showing obvious signs of having been beaten and tortured.\n3.Arrests\n40.The complainants allege that shortly after the murder of the EGSA trade union leader Pedro Quevedo on 12 December 1978, 23 workers were placed in gaol on false charges. They add that on 20 April 1979 Yolanda Urizar Martinez de Aguilar and Rosa Maria Wantlan Garcia, lawyers working for the trade union movement and advisers to the CNT, were arrested at Guatemala City airport together with a secretary working for the CNT. On 17 December 1979 Alfredo Briones, Willy Mijangos and Carlos Gmez, militant members of the CNT, were also arrested.\n41.The complainants also allege that on 6 March 1980 Mario Rolando Cancinos, Fernando Castillo, Noel Escobar, Ageo Morales and Henry Cristbal, all members of the Agua Capa Hydroelectric Works Union at Santa Rosa, were arrested at a meeting where they were discussing their collective demands. Regarding the arrest of Guillermo Hernandez Gomez, Secretary of the sanitation workers\' union (INCESA), which was referred to in the allegations concerning Case No. 957, the complainants report that this in fact took place on 24 March 1980 when the police intervened in a demonstration of workers at the CAMSA furniture factory.\n42.The complainants further allege that on 21 June 1980, after the murders of Edgar Ren Aldama and Oscar Amilcar Tatuaca, the CNT Executive Committee met delegates of the trade unions concerned at the headquarters of the CNT to discuss what action should be taken and to discuss a possible demonstration to protest against the murders. During the discussion a group of 60 heavily armed men, claiming to be members of the state security forces, blocked traffic in the street of Guatemala City next to the CNT headquarters, broke down the door with a jeep, broke up the meeting and arrested 27 trade unionists, who were led in small groups to unknown destinations. The national police claim that they have no knowledge of the whereabouts of these arrested people, whose names are as follows: Ismael Vzquez Ortiz, Orlando Prez and Florentino Gmez Lpez (members of the EGSA workers\' union), Mario Martinez and Luis Rodolfo Bonilla (members of the Foremost dairy workers\' union), Bernardo Marroquin Salazar, Antonio Rodriguez Ramos and Rafael Antonio Aguilar Prez (members of the Kerns Food Products union), Florencia Xocop Chvez, Gonzalo Vzquez, Manuel Snchez and Oscar Salazar (members of the CNT organising Committee), Sonia Furio (member of the BIC union), Irma Prez Osorio and Hilda Carlota Prez Menndez (General Secretary and member respectively of the INDUPLASTIC union), Sara Cabrera Flores (General Secretary of the AGRICASA union).

One of them, Marcelino Santos Chacn, was later released after being assaulted and interrogated by the police.\n44.On 24 August 1980, the complainants claim, 17 trade union leaders were arrested by the national police at the Emauz estate (Escuintla) when they were holding a meeting. They were later transferred to the national police headquarters in Guatemala City. The arrested include: Gustavo Adolfo Bejarano, Guillermo Alberto Moreno Valencia, Juan Guerra, Rafael Girn Mrida, Guillermo Turcios, Edgar de la Cruz, Augusto Yach Ciriaco, Iliana de la Cruz, Roldn Alberto Salazar Uriza, Alfonso Molina Mrida, and the director of the Emauz estate, Jos Luis Pea.\n45.Finally, in a communication dated 8 May 1981, the WCL submitted a list of other trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested.

The Chilean authorities\' response to the second national day of protest - continue the complainants - was to launch a new wave of arrests, break into trade union premises and deploy forces on a wide scale. The severe measures of repression resulted in four deaths (including the youths Particio Yez and Leopoldo Segovia), six injured persons (of whom two were seriously injured) and 58 arrests, including that of Rodolfo Seguel, President of the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC), arrested on 15 June 1983 together with his driver in the house of a trade union leader of the Confederation of Copper Workers, after having been assaulted. According to the WFTU, as many as 600 persons were arrested.\n623.In communications dated 20, 22 and 23 June 1983, the complainants point out that 20 trade union leaders and trade unionists are in detention and committed to trial; they belong to the CTC, the National Confederation of Building Workers and the Confederation of Agricultural Workers and, apart from Rodolfo Seguel, they include Hugo Estivalez (Vice-President of the CTC), Carlos Opazo (President of the Agricultural Confederation ""El Surco""), Sergio Troncoso (President of the National Confederation of Building Workers), Segundo Cancino, Sergio Villalobos, as well as the trade unionists Manuel Caro, Jorge Orstica, Hernol Flores, Federico Mujica and Juan Mimitza. Their only crime is to have demanded that trade union and democratic rights be restored in the country. Furthermore, a considerable number of trade union leaders and thousands of workers (4,000 according to the ICFTU and 2,400 according to the WCL) in the copper sector had allegedly arrested and the main copper mines were occupied by the Armed Forces.\n624.The complainants further allege that on 7 July 1983, members of the National Information Agency (CNI) broke into the premises of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS), stole furniture and equipment and abducted Mara Rozas, Anselmo Navarrete, Luis Fuentealba, Particia Miranda, Muriel Cornejo and Humberto Arcos, all CNS union leaders. Mara Rozas and Anselmo Naverrete were allegedly brutally tortured and were in a serious physical condition. According to the complainants, Miguel Vega and Arturo Martnez, President and Vice-President of the CNS, respectively, have been in detention since 9 July 1983, as are three labour lawyers: Gabriel Valdez, Jos de Gregorio and Jorge Lavandero.\n625.The complainants also allege the arrest on 21 June 1983 of Hctor Sols, President of the Metropolitan Trade Union of Excavators and Sewage Workers and Valentn Osorno, trade union leader. The latter, who was arrested by members of the CNI, was later banished, as was Sergio Troncoso, to a locality in the extreme south of the country. The complainants enclose written statements from those concerned, testifying that they were subjected to torture, especially beatings and electric shock treatment.\n626.With particular respect to the allegations of torture, the ICFTU states that it sent a trade union mission to Chile between 21 and 24 July 1983. According to the ICFTU, this mission was able to prove that the regime\'s secret police (the National Information Agency) continues to subject prisoners to torture. This mission received first-hand evidence from Maria Rozas (trade union leader) and Anselmo Navarrete (trade unionist) - who had just been released - and from Sergio Troncoso (trade union leader), who was still banished at the time. According to this evidence, the methods of torture used range from physical brutality, electric shock treatment, immersion in sewage, sleep deprivation, hypnosis, etc., to ""refined"" techniques of psychological torture.\n627.The complainants allege that the trade union leader Rodolo Seguel had been arrested again upon an order from the Ministry of the Interior, this time in August 1983, for having protested against the social and economic, political and moral crisis reigning in the country. This trade union leader has allegedly gone on hunger strike to protest against his unfair arrest.\n628.Furthermore, the ICFTU encloses information on arrests, trials and requests for the disqualification and dismissal of trade union leaders or workers.\n629.Finally, the complainants allege in recent communications that on Friday, 7 October, Ral Montecinos, trade union leader of the Salvador area and member of the National Council of the Confederation of Copper Workers, was abducted from a taxi while on his way to the headquarters of this Confederation in Santiago. The abductors, dressed as civilians but presumably members of the National Information Agency, forcefully pushed the trade unionist into another car in front of many witnesses. After being detained for many hours, he was left dying on a wasteland at the outskirts of Santiago. During his captivity, he had been brutally tortured and interrogated about his trade union activities. He was threatened by death if he continued with these activities. According to the complainants, Mr. Montecinos had also received death threats in the hospital to which he was later taken.\n630.With respect to the allegation that Rodolfo Seguel was attacked by persons travelling in a jeep, who repeatedly rammed into his car, the Government states that on 2 June 1983, between 9:30 and 10 a.m., Dr. Sergio Sebastiani, Director of the medical surgery ""Confraternidad"" (Brotherhood) in the town of San Bernardo, was driving along the north-south highway in a jeep to attend urgently to a sick patient; glancing into his rear-view mirror, he noticed another car flashing its lights at him to overtake. The doctor was unable to give way because there', ""occur because of connivance between major export enterprises and the multinationals that provide production services to them, in the absence of appropriate measures by the State to put an end to such practices. The authorities confine themselves to imposing minor fines on enterprises found guilty of violations, but do not put an end to the violation. The SME alleges further that the Vias Tarapac and Santa Helena enterprises are also guilty of having allowed strike-breakers to come and work in their installations to replace the striking workers employed by HERPA S.A.\n583.The SME points out further that the CODELCO state enterprise, Mina El Teniente division, in Rancagua, region VI, hires subcontractors to work their copper mines, and the latter hire further subcontractors in turn. The CODELCO enterprise thus does not have contractual relationships with all of the miners working in the areas owned by it. The SME alleges that in November 2002 these enterprises refused to engage in collective bargaining. The Provincial Labour Inspectorate changed its original stance and now supports the subcontractors, citing orders issued by the Labour Directorate itself, which have not been approved by Parliament and which entail in practice an amendment of legislation, since they deny the right to bargain collectively to thousands of unionized workers.\n584.Various attempts by the Inter-enterprise Trade Union of Workers of the CODELCO Enterprises (SITELCO) to set up a joint body to seek possible solutions with representatives of the enterprise were rejected on the grounds that the enterprise does not have contractual relationships with the workers. CODELCO refuses to recognize the trade union and has even filed a lawsuit against it, considering it an illegal association.\n585.Shortly after the draft collective agreement was presented to the CODELCO subcontractors, Mina El Teniente division, three of the union s leaders were beaten in the public thoroughfare  so that they would stop causing problems'  At the beginning of December 2003, the CODELCO enterprise prevented union leaders from going to the worksites where its members were working. On 15 December, workers employed by the subcontractors started a sit-in strike to get the enterprises to negotiate with the trade union on the draft collective agreement. Apparently as a result of CODELCO s intervention, the enterprises rejected the proposal and said that they would only negotiate with staff delegates, excluding the trade union.\n586.During discussions at the worksite, the enterprises proposed a particular form of bargaining (enterprise by enterprise) with a trade union presence. Although this proposal was accepted by the trade union, the enterprises subsequently withdrew their proposal. On the afternoon of 15 December the workers peacefully occupied the main entrances to the mine. There were no cases of persons attacked or security endangered. In the morning of 16 December, the workers received an ultimatum from the enterprise ordering them to leave the mine. Without attempting to negotiate a solution, about two hours later the workers were attacked by police using truncheons, firearms and 12-gauge shotguns with rubber-coated steel bullets or shot.\n587.A total of 16 workers were injured, some of them seriously. The worker Enzo Prez was hit by 20 shots. Police arrested 115 strikers (including the wounded) and released them on the afternoon of the same day. The police succeeded in breaking the strike and evicting the workers.\n588.As of the date on which the complaint was presented, 220 workers had been dismissed for participating in this action. CODELCO called for dismissal of the striking workers and their inclusion on blacklists so that they would not be able to return to its premises or work for its subcontractors.\n589.The SME alleges that there was no court order to evict the strikers and that the police acted illegally on behalf of the CODELCO state enterprise, as it had on many other occasions.\n590.The SME emphasizes that the contract workers' real employer is CODELCO, which is jointly responsible for the obligations of its subcontractors towards its workers, including with regard to trade union rights. It adds that, as CODELCO is a state enterprise, the State also bears responsibility for the anti-union measures.\n591.In its communication dated 4 September 2003, which was also signed by the National Confederation of Construction Workers (CNTC), the National Confederation of Healthcare Workers (CONFENATS), the National Association of Workers of the Youth Protection Service (ANTRASE), the Metropolitan College of Teachers (CRP), the National Confederation of Road Transport Workers (CONUTT), the National Inter-enterprise Trade Union of Commercial, Textile, Garment and Allied Workers (SCTV) and the National Inter-enterprise Trade Union of Security Guards, Watchmen and General Services and Allied Workers, the SME alleges that the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT), during the May Day celebrations in 2003, called on Chilean workers to hold a nationwide 24-hour strike on 13 August 2003. The workers observed the strike and participated actively; in all of the cities throughout the country there were demonstrations, stoppages and blockages caused by marches and demonstrations of workers, of which the authorities had been duly informed in advance. In order to avoid serious harm to the public, the different trade unions and professional associations maintained emergency services, for example in public health services; even teachers ensured that poor pupils were served meals in schools. The trade union leadership and members had carried out their preparations with a great deal of responsibility and forethought. The Chilean workers had presented their list of demands, entitled  For a fair Chile'  explaining the reasons and demands behind the national strike, at a meeting held in September 2002 with the President of the Republic and his ministers. The reasons and demands are as follows:' against growing and unfair social inequalities;' against the application of an economic model that generates unemployment and makes work more precarious;' the authorities should enforce labour law, because over one-half of the enterprises systematically violate it;' put a stop to blatant anti-union persecution and guarantee workers the right to form trade unions freely and without threats;' ensure that workers can engage in genuine collective bargaining, because this right does not exist in practice;' reject the changes"", ""to develop that was hardly suitable for the negotiations planned for October of that year between Lan Chile S.A. and the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians of Lan Chile S.A. It should be noted that this situation developed following the attack and destruction of the Twin Towers in the United States, and that this incident obviously had an effect on some of the events denounced by the trade union, but does not provide a single or sufficient explanation.\n328.The Government then lists a series of events which, as it points out, constitute anti-union practices.Individual bargaining between the enterprise and pilots\n329.During the second quarter of 2001, the enterprise created subsidiary enterprises to which some unionized pilots were transferred following individual bargaining, which provided them with access to improved financial conditions, and their withdrawal of trade union membership. This process was public knowledge and was even encouraged by company executives.Publicity campaign against collective bargaining\n330.The atmosphere being experienced within Lan Chile S.A. was made known to the public through articles in the press that appeared repeatedly from August 2001 onwards. These articles pointed out that the collective bargaining process to be carried out by the pilots was a threat to the entreprise and to the country s economy given that the bargaining appeared to be intrinsically linked to conflicts and paralysis. These conclusions stem from articles that appeared in the  El Mercurio' newspaper during August 2001.\n331.In a public notice, the trade union s executive board qualified these articles in the press as a campaign against the trade union in order to discredit the workers' organization and discourage collective bargaining by generating a negative public opinion. The trade union responded by implementing the industrial action entitled  work-to-rule'  consisting in fulfilling the provisions of aeronautical regulations to the letter. This obviously involved the non-infringement of applicable standards, but also involved straying from the usual practices employed by the enterprise in air navigation processes, and which are outside the regulations, in order to cut costs for fuel and other consumables.Mass dismissal of active trade union members\n332.These events were followed by the mass dismissal of unionized pilots. Between 14 September and 4 October 2001, the company dismissed 108 members. In 23 of these cases the company invoked  company requirements' as the reason for the dismissals and in 85 cases it invoked the  serious breach of contractual obligations'  When the enterprise describes the serious breach of contractual obligations, it refers, inter alia, to confusing situations which led to delays for some flights. However, there is no clear relationship between the delays and the breach of contracts or internal regulations.\n333.Following the dismissal of these 85 workers, the company reinstated 40 of them. Amongst those not reinstated were eight former trade union directors and workers who participated in the 1995 legal strike. Therefore, the measure was highly discriminatory given that, in essence, it affected the most active members of the organization, namely those who were dismissed for respecting a trade union agreement consisting in  work-to-rule'  without violating contractual or legal standards.\n334.The 37 workers affected filed a motion to vacate the dismissals before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago, filed under  Bustamante and Others versus Lan Chile S.A.' (Case No. 5196-2000).Reduction in the workers' negotiating power\n335.The dismissals prior to the commencement of collective bargaining had repercussions on the collective bargaining process promoted by the trade union in that only 111 members participated. This represents a 200 per cent reduction in the number of participants compared with the previous collective bargaining process. The process was concluded without a strike and a four-year collective agreement was signed, with a 56 per cent reduction in the pay increase that otherwise would have been due. At the same time, the entreprise came to an agreement with three groups of pilots, who during the previous negotiation process formed part of the trade union, in the form of 62-month collective agreements with a lower pay adjustment.Pressure exerted by Lan Chile S.A. for thewithdrawal of trade union membership\n336.Following inspections by the employment services during the course of 2001, it was established that unionized pilots and technicians were subjected to intense pressure aimed at making them withdraw membership from their trade union organization. This is shown in documents and communications issued by the employer which offer improved conditions of work that are incompatible with continued trade union membership. This approach was also reflected in the implicit threats of dismissal that were made by some supervisors and acknowledged by some workers during conversations with the officer from the Labour Inspectorate. As a result, the trade union executive board received membership withdrawals from mid-2001 until the first-quarter of 2002; it currently has only 71 members.Discrimination against trade unionmembers with regard to training\n337.Lan Chile S.A. excluded trade union members from flight training for operating the new company airplanes. This was subsequently taken up by the trade union executive board with the employer, but this measure was not reversed. In the past, training was considered a recompense for pilots' seniority. According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the enterprise, such exclusion became apparent shortly before the collective bargaining process began.

They were originally submitted to the ILO prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in 1985. The Government has since sent information on these cases in communications dated 21 April and 6 and 8 May 1986.\n230.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n231.The allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence committed by employers against workers, trade union activists and union leaders in the sugar cane plantations and alcohol distilleries of several States of Brazil, and specifically in Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, and to the failure of the Government to put a stop to them.\n232.In the case of the State of Pernambuco in particular, the allegations concern the banning of union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and even the assassination of union leaders or their relations simply for having demanded the implementation or renewal of collective agreements. Moreover, the complainants claim that a situation bordering on slavery and forced labour has developed in these regions, with workers being recruited clandestinely from other parts of the country to break the strikes called by the regular workers belonging to FETAPE.\n233.The complainants explained that following a general strike in 1979 the 240,000 rural workers of the sugar cane growing area secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From 1979 to 1983 other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the labour court and the workers became aware that they could take legal action to have them enforced. As from 1982, however, the employers began to sabotage the agreements by recruiting huge numbers of unemployed labour from the drought-stricken areas of Sertao and Agreste. They got rid of the regular workers and replaced them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from those areas. After the harvest, these workers returned to their home districts and had no way of demanding that their rights be respected before a labour court.\n234.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation which, after the 1982 elections, relaxed its supervision. In order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers from the Meta area, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or tripling the daily volume of work provided for in the collective agreements. They brought private militia onto the sugar plantations, armed with revolvers and rifles, to ""pay a visit"" on the inhabitants and ""supervise"" the payment of the workers. Some workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; the land was laid waste and turned into cane-fields. The employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the labour standards stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting union dues from their pay. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations and punished workers who, as union delegates, attempted to keep in touch with their union. Some whose names were communicated by CONTAG and the ICFTU received death threats, were locked up in private prisons or were even assassinated, especially in the Goias area.\n235.In the State of Sao Paulo the FTIC is unable to organise the workers of the state alcohol distilleries and is being prevented from establishing occupational associations that could subsequently become trade uninons. In Gantus , for instance, an agro-industrial enterprise with a distillery in Tupa, the employer has circulated a petition among the staff stating that the workers recognise that the enterprise is well run and rejecting the ""inopportune"" remarks of Pedro GonUales da Silva, a union leader responsible for unionisation in the State of Sao Paulo. The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.\n236.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers\' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country\'s land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic\'s solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.\n237.The Government notes that in May 1985 collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed.

The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.\n236.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers\' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country\'s land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic\'s solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.\n237.The Government notes that in May 1985 collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed. It encloses a copy of the agreements between the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo and the Federation of Agricultural Workers, the Sugar Industries\' Trade Union and the Alcohol Industries\' Trade Union of the State of Sao Paulo.

In addition, in a communication of 17 June 1987 several Employers\' delegates to the 73rd Session (1987) of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article 26 of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, of infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144).\n5.The Committee has examined these questions on several occasions, most recently in November 1988 (see 261st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its 241st Session (November 1988)) on the basis of information compiled on the spot from 29 September to 4 October 1988 by a study mission conducted by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n6.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted new allegations in communications of 22 December 1988 and 23 January 1989. The Government supplied its observations in communications dated 3 January and 3, 8, 13, 15 and 16 February 1989.\n8.In its communication of 22 December 1988, the IOE alleges that on 13 October 1988 the Ministry of the Interior banned, for an unlimited period, the radio programme broadcast on Radio Mundial by the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), entitled ""The Nicaraguan"". According to the IOE, this programme reviews the main features of the economic and social situation of the country and suggests possible solutions in which the COSEP and its members would like to co-operate.\n9.Moreover, the IOE notes that on 2 November 1988, also by order of the Ministry of the Interior, the programme ""Seis en Punto"" broadcast by Radio Corporacin was banned indefinitely. The IOE points out that the Director of Radio Corporacin and of the banned programme is Mr. Jos Castillo Oseja, a prominent member of the COSEP who has already suffered at the hands of the regime on many occasions, particularly during a beating by the Minister of the Interior on 29 April 1988.\n10.The IOE emphasises that Radio Corporacin, Radio Catlica, Radio Noticias and Radio Mundial were closed down in May 1988, and that Radio Corporacin, Radio Mundial and eight other radio stations were threatened with closure in July 1988. Furthermore, La Prensa, already closed down for two weeks in July 1988, regularly receives threats that it will be closed down again. According to the IOE, this proves that the Government\'s repressive attitude regarding information remains unchanged.\n11.Concerning the case of Mr. Mario Alegra, the director of COSEP\'s research institute sentenced to 16 years in prison, the IOE objects to the fact that, apart from the disregard shown for the defendant\'s rights during the investigation (confessions were extracted in illegal conditions), he is still in detention while the appeals court dealing with his case has still not given a verdict, though the time-limit provided for by the Criminal Code of Procedure has long since expired.\n12.In its communication of 23 January 1989, the IOE alleges that on 9 January 1989 the Government ordered the closing down, for an unlimited period, of the programme ""Seis en punto"", broadcast by Radio Corporacin. The programme is accused of having carried news concerning the dismissal of public servants from the Ministry of the Interior. According to the IOE, the news in question had already been carried by pro-government radio stations, which were not ordered closed. The IOE goes on to state that the Government was obliged to revoke this measure in view of its manifest arbitrariness.\n13.In its communication dated 3 January 1989, the Government expresses its desire to inform the Committee of the implementation of a set of measures which have been undertaken in the country as a concrete expression of the Government\'s flexibility and will to promote an improvement in relations among the various social, economic and political sectors and forces in Nicaraguan society.\n14.In this context, the Government and the higher labour authorities have borne in mind the recommendations and suggestions made by the Governing Body at its November 1988 Session, as well as the opinions expressed by the study mission which visited Nicaragua. The Government thus reports on various measures which were adopted in December 1988.\n15.Firstly, the Government indicates that it has decided to release Mr. Carlos Humbres in spite of his proven guilt in the matter and the purely political nature of his case. The Government has thus demonstrated its flexibility and its political willingness to achieve peace, since this gesture will be appreciated by those who have participated in the aggression against Nicaragua. This is a genuine expression of the Revolution\'s desire to create a national consensus in which all of the forces of the country will be able to contribute to the reconstruction of the nation.\n16.In the same vein, the Government also released the persons involved in the violation of laws concerning public order during the Nandaime events. These releases should also be considered a concrete expression of the Government\'s flexibility and its readiness to support and intensify a political dialogue with all sectors of the nation in the search for a consensus to tackle the tasks of reconstruction of the country, which is currently suffering from the economic effects of hurricane ""Juana"" and the war of aggression. Although there is no doubt that the defendants violated the law, the Government has deemed it necessary to take concrete steps to create a national climate of responsible and constructive dialogue.\n17.The Government goes on to say that the President of the Republic, in his New Year\'s message appealed to all the economic, social and political sectors of the country to establish an effective dialogue on the basis of mutual co-operation so they may patriotically assume the tasks and responsibilities entailed by the current process of national reconstruction.\n18.Moreover, the labour authorities are currently preparing some legislative reforms which will make it possible to eliminate permanently some problems of compatibility between national laws and regulations and international labour', ""requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated 23 May 1988 which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November 1988 meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article 26 of the ILO Constitution.\n4.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos. 1129 and 1298) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. 1344, 1351 and 1372) by the International Organisation of Employers.\n5.Cases Nos. 1298 and 1344 were last examined by the Committee at its November 1986 meeting and Cases Nos. 1129 and 1351 in February 1987. (See respectively 246th Report, paras. 197 to 265, and 248th Report, paras. 421 to 436, approved by the Governing Body at its 234th and 235th Sessions (November 1986 and February-March 1987).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. 1372.\n6.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated 5 May 1987 (for Case No. 1129), 14 August 1987 (for Cases Nos. 1129, 1298, 1344 and 1351), 13 January 1988 (for Cases Nos. 1129 and 1298) and 3 February 1988 (for Cases Nos. 1298, 1344 and 1372).\n7.In addition, in a communication of 17 June 1987, several employers' delegates to the 73rd Session (1987) of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article 26 of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of 5, 19 and 28 January 1988.\n48.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.\n49.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.\n50.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.\n51.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.\n52.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, 236th Report, Case No. 1269 (El Salvador), para. 536.) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.\n53.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.\n54.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September 1985, the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.\n55.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these"", ""requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated 23 May 1988 which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal.

According to a memorandum dated 16 June 1994 after the complaint referred to in this report had been lodged, the Secretary-General of SITAGAH asked the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to review the procedures for examining dismissals, as provided for in item 3 of the document dated 16 May. In the memorandum, he also provided information on the appointment by his organization of representatives to sit on the ""tripartite committee"" provided for in the document to look into the dismissals. In view of all this, the Government of Costa Rica cannot understand why the complainant organization is turning to an international body to make accusations against a government which has always been willing to deal with its problems. Furthermore, on 20 August 1994 the Secretary-General of SITAGAH once again requested that, pursuant to labour legislation and the institution\'s rules of procedure, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security should summon the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise with a view to resolving the following problems: follow-up to the document dated 16 May 1994 and the deduction of trade union dues, as requested by members and the trade union.\n416.As can be seen from the above, in terms of ministerial mediation, a series of efforts were made which resulted in a far-reaching agreement that ended the dispute. This confirms the rashness of the complaint in question in so far as it has neither a factual nor a legal basis, which is why it should be rejected outright, bearing in mind that it was lodged after the dispute was settled. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Government has gone beyond conciliation and mediation efforts. It went as far as carrying out labour inspections, through the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Its efforts in dealing with the union claim of persecution and unfair labour practices are set out below.\n417.The National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate have, at all times, carried out the necessary procedure to deal with the complaint of union persecution lodged by SITAGAH against the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise. At present, as can be seen from the information enclosed, the investigation into the matter is at the stage of receiving and analysing the documents provided by the complainant union.\n418.On the other hand, and since the complaint mentions alleged violent incidents between the Costa Rican Civil Guard and a number of workers, it is important to point out that the Civil Guard acted in compliance with a warrant from the office of the mayor of Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia, on the basis of a decision of 11 May 1994 that the police should re-establish access to the highway and remove obstacles preventing free circulation, as the highway had been blocked by a group of demonstrators. In any case, it should be noted that the security forces operate in accordance with the constitutional legal system and the competent judicial authority. The actions of the security forces which were present at the scene of the events and are mentioned in the complaint were in conformity with the prevailing legal order and institutional structures of our country.\n419.It should be pointed that the complainants instituted legal proceedings. However, their efforts came to nothing because they were badly planned, as the case was within the competence of ordinary labour courts, and not the Constitutional Chamber, where they lodged their grievance.\n420.Finally, the remaining allegations of unfair labour practices, including: the dismissal of workers belonging to trade unions, solidarist interference in union affairs, and the use of private police forces to prevent trade union expansion by the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise (Costa Rica branch) against the complainant trade union are being examined by the National Labour Inspection Directorate, which will submit a report.\n431.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction the recent legal provisions concerning protection against anti-union discrimination and guarantees preventing solidarist associations from engaging in trade union activities and that trade unions are not given unfavourable treatment as compared with solidarist associations.(b) The Committee urges that the Bill on the statutory regulations governing public employment and the civil service, collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, and the Bill on the occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund (which provides that trade unions, as well as solidarist associations, may administer dismissal compensation funds) be adopted in the near future and that they will be in full confomity with the requirements laid down in ratified ILO Conventions. The Committee urges the Government to expedite the passage of both Bills and to continue this process with ILO technical assistance.(c) With regard to the Bills on the ""democratization of the public sector"", and ""the National Port Council"", the Committee requests the authorities engaged in consultations with trade union organizations, if they have not already done so, also to take measures to ensure that the prospective Act will allow workers of the National Port Council to enjoy the right to strike as a consequence of their freedom of action.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of proceedings before the judicial authority relating to the alleged anti-union dismissal of ten workers at the TALMANA S.A. enterprise.(e) The Committee recommends that the Government take the necessary measures to enable the trade union leaders and members of the Corporacin Peter S.A., Compaia Agropecuraria Ro Jimnez S.A. and Industrias Realtex S.A. enterprises who have been dismissed because of their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their posts.(f) The Committee urges the Government to reply to the allegations of anti-union dismissals and practices at the LACSA enterprise, on which it has', 'Government of Costa Rica alleging violation of freedom of association and interference by solidarist associations in union matters and collective bargaining at Sarapiqu banana plantations.\n415.One example to be noted is the incongruity in the union\'s position as it tries to take two different tacks at the same time.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the Government has gone beyond conciliation and mediation efforts. It went as far as carrying out labour inspections, through the National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Its efforts in dealing with the union claim of persecution and unfair labour practices are set out below.\n417.The National Directorate and General Labour Inspectorate have, at all times, carried out the necessary procedure to deal with the complaint of union persecution lodged by SITAGAH against the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise. At present, as can be seen from the information enclosed, the investigation into the matter is at the stage of receiving and analysing the documents provided by the complainant union.\n418.On the other hand, and since the complaint mentions alleged violent incidents between the Costa Rican Civil Guard and a number of workers, it is important to point out that the Civil Guard acted in compliance with a warrant from the office of the mayor of Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia, on the basis of a decision of 11 May 1994 that the police should re-establish access to the highway and remove obstacles preventing free circulation, as the highway had been blocked by a group of demonstrators. In any case, it should be noted that the security forces operate in accordance with the constitutional legal system and the competent judicial authority. The actions of the security forces which were present at the scene of the events and are mentioned in the complaint were in conformity with the prevailing legal order and institutional structures of our country.\n419.It should be pointed that the complainants instituted legal proceedings. However, their efforts came to nothing because they were badly planned, as the case was within the competence of ordinary labour courts, and not the Constitutional Chamber, where they lodged their grievance.\n420.Finally, the remaining allegations of unfair labour practices, including: the dismissal of workers belonging to trade unions, solidarist interference in union affairs, and the use of private police forces to prevent trade union expansion by the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise (Costa Rica branch) against the complainant trade union are being examined by the National Labour Inspection Directorate, which will submit a report.\n431.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction the recent legal provisions concerning protection against anti-union discrimination and guarantees preventing solidarist associations from engaging in trade union activities and that trade unions are not given unfavourable treatment as compared with solidarist associations.(b) The Committee urges that the Bill on the statutory regulations governing public employment and the civil service, collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, and the Bill on the occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund (which provides that trade unions, as well as solidarist associations, may administer dismissal compensation funds) be adopted in the near future and that they will be in full confomity with the requirements laid down in ratified ILO Conventions. The Committee urges the Government to expedite the passage of both Bills and to continue this process with ILO technical assistance.(c) With regard to the Bills on the ""democratization of the public sector"", and ""the National Port Council"", the Committee requests the authorities engaged in consultations with trade union organizations, if they have not already done so, also to take measures to ensure that the prospective Act will allow workers']"

As to entry into the teaching profession, it states that the new arrangements are on the basis of a competitive examination.\n385.The Committee recalls that, in the present case, the complaints form part of a long dispute between teachers' organizations and the Government, which gave rise to protests and strikes during the period from 2010 to 2013, caused by the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the delays in the payment of salaries in arrears, among other factors. Further, the Committee recalls that the allegations still pending in this case relate to: (1) the death of a trade unionist on 18 March 2011, while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration; (2) the legal proceedings instituted against 24 teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration; (3) the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher level authority of the administration of the INPREMA; (4) the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, and its de-indexation from the minimum salary (preventing the continuing use of the minimum salary as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries); (5) the failure to pay salary increments from 2010 to 2013 and the suppression of the protests to which this gave rise; (6) the declaration of the protests as illegal by the administrative authority and the resulting sanctions imposed on more than 600 teachers; (7) the suspension of the deductions of union fees for teachers' organizations; (8) the adoption of Decision No. 15096-SE-2012 of 30 July 2012, which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes; (9) the refusal of requests for renewal of union leave; (10) the unilateral suspension of teacher selection boards and competitive examinations; (11) the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; (12) the civil liability claims brought against four SINPRODOH officials, for an amount of HNL49,070,777.49; (13) the workplace harassment of two members of the COPEMH; and (14) the sanctions against trade unionists in the teaching profession and other restrictions on trade union rights.\n386.With regard to recommendation (a), the Committee observes that both the complainant organization and the Government concur that the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a cerebral oedema. However, the Committee notes a contradiction in the account of the circumstances leading to her death: the complainant organization alleges that prior to the collision, the victim suffered a blow to the head which caused her to lose her balance and fall onto the roadway, in a context of political repression, and attributes the cerebral oedema to the blow to the head; whereas the Government denies that there was any political repression and attributes the cerebral oedema solely to the collision. The Committee notes that according to the information provided by the Government, a driver has been charged with culpable homicide and a final judgment is pending. The Committee recalls that  [t]he killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, 2006, para. 48]. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings.\n387.Concerning recommendation (b), the Committee notes that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization, the teachers remain in detention and the legal proceedings have suffered delays; the Government has not denied the situation and only indicates that the proceedings have not concluded. The Committee recalls that  justice delayed is justice denied' [see Digest, op. cit., para. 105]. Observing with concern that the imprisonment of 24 teachers took place in 2011 and that the Government still does not provide information on the specific acts imputed to them, the Committee emphasizes that prolonged detention of persons awaiting trial involves a risk of abuse. Thus, the Committee expects that all necessary measures are taken so that the ongoing legal proceedings can be concluded without further delay and that measures for conditional release are provided if the judicial decisions are not taken in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n388.As to recommendation (c), the Committee notes the complainant organization s statement that there has not been any communication from the Government, and the Government s explanation of the extension of the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the need to adapt to the economic circumstances of the State. The Committee reiterates its request to the Government and the complainant organizations to seek a negotiated solution acceptable to all the parties concerned, in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in the ratified Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. Furthermore, it requests the"", ""organizations and the Government, which gave rise to protest movements and strikes, during the period from 2010 to 2013, caused by the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the delays in the payment of salaries in arrears, among other things.\n409.Similarly, the Committee observes that the allegations refer to: (1) the death of a trade union activist on 18 March 2011, while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration; (2) the legal proceedings instituted against 24 teachers, for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration; (3) the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher authority of the administration of INPREMA; (4) the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, and its de-indexation from the minimum salary (preventing the continuing use of the minimum salary as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries); (5) the failure to pay salary increases from 2010 to 2013 and the suppression of the protests to which this gave rise; (6) the declaration of the protest movements as illegal by the administrative authority and the resulting sanctions imposed on more than 600 teachers; (7) the suspension of the deductions in union fees for teachers' organizations; (8) the adoption of Decision No. 15096-SE-2012, of 30 July 2012, which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes; (9) the refusal of requests for renewal of union leave; (10) the unilateral suspension of Teacher Selection and Competitive Recruitment Boards; (11) the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; (12) the civil liability claims brought against four SINPRODOH officials, for an amount of HNL49,070,777.49; and (13) the professional persecution of two members of the COPEMH.\n410.The Committee notes that the Government states that its actions are not directed against the SINPRODOH. It also notes the following statements by the Government: (1) the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a young, reckless driver, who hit her while driving against the flow of traffic. The forensic report of the Public Prosecutor s office excludes the possibility that, prior to her fall, she had been hit by an object designed for use by the military or police; (2) the teachers were arrested for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association for assaulting several police officers with mortar rockets. Due process was respected at all times and, to date, no teacher has been convicted for the aforementioned facts; (3) the reforms outlined in Decree No. 247 2011, of 14 December 2011, containing the National Social Welfare Institute for Teachers Act were based on actuarial studies carried out by the CNBS, and were disseminated among the teachers' unions in 2010; (4) Decree-Law No. 224-2010, of 28 October 2010, suspended the economic regimes established in the different professional statutes, as they are fiscal measures which served as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries, to the detriment of the budgets of centralized and decentralized state institutions; in this respect, the administrative appeal lodged by the SINPRODOH was not successful, since the country s financial situation did not allow for further and greater commitments beyond those contained in the National General Income and Expenditure Budget; (5) the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, and this delay (that is the failure to pay on the 20th day of each month) affected teachers at the national level and their unrest was understandable, which was why the Secretariat issued Decision No. 15907-SE-2012, of 19 December 2012, temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions for teachers to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as union contributions and other legal and court fees. The State Secretariat of the Education Department has acted for many years as a management body to channel the deductions for teachers' unions, in line with requests made by teachers. It sent the circular letter to the six presidents of teachers' organizations belonging to the FOMH, requesting them to report on the amounts, use and handling of funds received. Voluntary deductions were resumed for the teachers' unions that had submitted the reports requested, namely the COPRUMH and the COLPEDAGOGOSH; (6) the adoption of Decision No. 15096-SE-2012, of 30 June 2012, which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspension of classes, was motivated by the desire to fulfil the right to education and the minimum number of class days; (7) the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments has declared illegal the strikes and protests launched by teachers' representatives in the past two years; consequently, pursuant to national legislation on the disciplinary regime, Executive Decision No. 15575-SE-2012, of 18 October 2012, was issued, imposing sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be; (8) the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid union leave made by certain teachers is based on national legislation, which should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this respect, there was a case in which the request for leave was indeed granted (Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA), and another case in which the request for leave was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the executive board (Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA). In most cases, the requests for renewal of paid union leave were refused because the time limit set under the regulations of the teacher s organization concerned had been exceeded; (9) the State Secretariat of the Education Department began a  teacher reorganization' process, which aimed to return teachers assigned to other education establishments to the schools where they had"", ""Executive Decision No. 15575-SE-2012, of 18 October 2012, by which it was agreed to deduct from their monthly salary the days not worked by those teachers if, according to the acts recorded, it is established that they did not report for duty on 22, 30 and 31 August, and that the number of days of absence does not exceed two. In addition, in those cases where the teacher has failed to report for work, without good cause, for two whole and consecutive days or three working days in a month, that is the dates indicated above, the employment contract with the State Secretariat of the Education Department shall be deemed terminated, with no liability on the part of the above institution, pursuant to all the above sanctions, failures and dismissals.\n397.As regards the allegations concerning suspension of union dues, the Government explains that, owing to the extra deductions imposed on teaching staff by teachers' unions and other banking and financial deductions, delays in the payment of teaching staff occurred, as a result of the tardiness of these organizations to report. The State Secretariat of the Education Department therefore issued Decision No. 15907-SE-2012, of 19 December 2012. A decision was taken to suspend temporarily the voluntary deductions granted to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding the mandatory dues such as those of INPREMA, the Honduran Social Security Institute (IHSS), union contributions, and other legal and judicial fees. The Government clarifies that, having received the reports requested by the State Secretariat of the Education Department for this purpose, voluntary deductions were resumed for the COPRUMH and the Teachers' College of Honduras (COLPEDAGOGOSH).\n398.Concerning the adoption of Decision No. 15096-SE-2012, of 30 June 2012, which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes, the Government states that the actions of the State Secretariat of the Education Department have been motivated by the desire to the right to education. The fact that, in the country, millions of young boys and girls and adults continue to be deprived of education opportunities, in many cases owing to poverty, together with the constant stoppages, strikes and occupation of education centres by teachers' representatives, has generated chaos in the education system in the past three years. The State Secretariat of the Education Department is endeavouring to achieve fulfilment of the right to education and the minimum time in terms of class days, which section 12 of the Regulations under the Honduran Teachers' Statute establishes as actual working time during the school year (that is ten months, with a minimum of 200 working days), for which reason it has taken action to guarantee the country s education, as envisaged in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the Regulations thereunder.\n399.As for the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid union leave, the Government indicates that department directors, department secretariats and subdepartments of human resources in charge of teachers were informed, by circular letter No. 0019-SE-2013, of 7 February 2013, that in order to grant paid union leave to teachers who occupy posts in the national executive boards of union organizations, consideration should be given to section 13(6)(d) of the Honduran Teachers' Statute, which refers to paid leave for those occupying managerial positions for the duration of the post. Consequently, this should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this regard, section 59 of the Regulations under the Honduran Teachers' Statute states:  All the legal provisions contained in article 13 of the Law shall be applied in each case by the immediate higher authority which, in turn, shall inform the corresponding authority accordingly.' The above circular letter was challenged before the State Secretariat of the Education Department and the appeal was declared not to be receivable as it did not meet the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n400.The Government refutes the allegation that circular letter No. 0019-SE-2013, of 7 February 2013, ordered the non-renewal of union leave for certain teachers in particular, such as the SINPRODOH officials, Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte and Mr Santos Blas Oviedo Rivas. The Government explains that action was taken to investigate whether the teachers had abandoned their jobs in the education centres, following failures or abandonment on the part of many teachers, and the constant complaints made by children s parents, in observance of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the Government clarifies that the leave requested by Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA, was granted.\n401.The Government states that, while Mr Armando Gmez Torres, President of PRICPHMA, Mr Orlando Meja Velsquez, Secretary-General of PRICPHMA, and Mr Cesar Augusto Ramos, Secretary for Legal Affairs of PRICPHMA, held posts as teachers' representatives and were on paid union leave, they illegally obtained new teaching positions in schools where they never reported for work. Furthermore, specific records show that on 19, 20 and 21 February 2014, none of the three teachers reported for work. Mr Jury Hernndez Troches, Secretary for the Environment of PRICPHMA, committed serious misconduct consisting of dereliction of duty from 8 February 2013 onwards. Mr Edwin Emilio Oliva, President of COLPROSUMAH, Mr Martin Suazo Sandoval, Secretary for Advertising of COLPROSUMAH, and Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte of the SINPRODOH also committed serious misconduct consisting of dereliction of duty, which is why they were dismissed.\n402.The Government emphasizes that the leave requested by Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA, was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the PRICPHMA executive board. In the case of Mr Walter Edgardo Rivera, Secretary for Advertising of PRICPHMA, the Court of Appeal for Administrative Disputes ordered a stay of proceedings prior to the request being resolved. Mr Murillo and Mr Rivera were not sanctioned and still have an employment relationship with the State Secretariat of the Education Department.\n403.The Government states that some representatives returned to their workplaces when the regional departments""]"

In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May 1978, the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its 186th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May 1978 accepted direct contacts by letter of 15 September 1978.\n41.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from 19 to 26 November 1978, and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises.

The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD).

A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of 7 December 1978 from the General Workers\' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union.

They are dealt with in Cases Nos. 672, 768, 802, 819, 822 and 847.\n37.The Committee examined Case No. 672 in May and November 1972 and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. 672, 768, 802, 819 and 822) in May 1976.2 Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November 19773 and May 1978.4\n38.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n39.In May 1976 the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.\n40.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May 1978, the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its 186th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May 1978 accepted direct contacts by letter of 15 September 1978.\n41.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from 19 to 26 November 1978, and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers\' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.\n42.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.\n43.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 under article 22 of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.\n44.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of 7 December 1978 from the General Workers\' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers\' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.\n1.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists\n45.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on 8 September 1978. All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.\n46.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within 46 hours of his arrest.

This exceptional situation made it necessary to introduce machinery and institutions combining previously-enacted legislative provisions and informal factors, which were successively applied in a process which is still under way. This process is transitional in nature and is guided by the State, with the objective of replacing administrative wage fixing which was typical during the dictatorship with free and responsible collective bargaining, mindful of the general interest.\n550.In order to encourage this process, the Government chose to give priority to promoting tripartism through the wage councils which had been instituted by an Act of 1943 which for 25 years until 1968 had constituted the framework for collective bargaining in the absence of other specific legal provisions. However, the possibility of objections to the validity of wage council decisions, which might be based either on doubts as to the effect of the 1943 Act itself or on the practical impossibility of exhausting the legal procedure for the appointment of wage council members, made it necessary for the sake of legal soundness for wage council decisions to be elaborated and brought into effect by administrative decision under the provisions of Act No. 13720 and Legislative Decree No. 14791. These texts had vested in the Government powers to regulate through administrative channels the remuneration of workers in the private sector. After more than a decade in which collective bargaining had completely disappeared, the reopening of the wage councils proved to be a suitable instrument for promoting bargaining. Thus, they both constituted an adequate framework for negotiation, and, in the absence of legal provisions laying down the obligation to negotiate, their periodical sessions meant that such a duty existed in practice.\n551.Aware of these effects, the Government, as the body responsible for convening the councils, regulated their frequency so that the parties would develop bargaining to cover increasingly longer periods without prejudice to the concurrent establishment of periodical procedures for the adjustment and increase of wages. The process under way may be divided into three clearly differentiated stages: in the first stage, running from mid-1985 to mid-1986, the wage councils were convened on a general basis every four months and their agreements also covered a four-month period; in the second stage, from mid-1986 to mid-1988, in addition to the general four-month meetings, the conclusion of ""long-term agreements"" in certain branches of activity was promoted; these agreements, negotiated bilaterally while the systems of four-monthly adjustment were maintained, covered longer periods of up to two years; lastly, in the third stage, which has lasted since mid-1988, the wage councils were convened in every case to conclude bilaterally negotiated ""long-term agreements"" covering at least 20 months and always subject to four-monthly adjustment. Since the wage councils had been set up, the Government had only availed itself in exceptional cases of the legal provisions empowering it to fix wages administratively except in so far as putting its decisions to effect.\n552.Throughout this process, the participation of state representatives in the bargaining bodies was aimed at safeguarding the general interest, which took the form of what was termed ""guide-lines"" intended to guide the parties with respect to the anti-inflationary policy in order to allow effective growth of ""real wages"" which had declined during the de facto regime. For this purpose, the ""guide-lines"" were linked directly and exclusively to the pricing policy, and limited the extent to which wage increases could be passed on to prices, without restricting the parties\' freedom to negotiate higher amounts of remuneration, as long as they were absorbed by the enterprises, whether by cutting profits, improving productivity or any other means of reducing costs. The ""guide-lines"" respected freedom of bargaining to such an extent that, as may be seen from the studies supplied, the wage increases granted as from 1985 consistently exceeded the limits for the mark-up of prices. This ultimately resulted in a considerable increase in real wages which, despite an annual inflation rate fluctuating around 70 per cent, are now some 30 per cent higher than in March 1985.\n553.Today, just four years after the restoration of democratic institutions in Uruguay, and as a result of the process outlined above, over 80 per cent of workers employed in the private sector are covered by ""long-term agreements"". These agreements are essentially negotiated bilaterally and regulate wages for periods of 20 months on average, including both mechanisms for maintaining purchasing power which are applied at four-monthly intervals with regular corrections, and machinery ensuring real growth, also applied periodically and linked to increases in various production variables.\n554.With this in mind, in order to complete the transition, the Government promoted consultation with the social partners at the level of the most representative national organisations of employers and workers. These consultations concerned the adoption of a framework agreement which, in accordance with the recommendations of the ILO mission, would in future draw up the principles for definitively setting up a system upon which a consensus has been reached, based on free and responsible collective bargaining, and mindful of the general interest (the Government encloses the report of the Tripartite Seminar on Industrial Relations). The Government\'s decision in this respect ultimately led to ratification of the Collective Bargaining Convention, 1981 (No. 154) approved by Act No. 16039 promulgated on 8 May 1989.\n555.As regards the functioning of the wage councils, whose reconvening has been welcomed, the complainant takes exception to the fact that their decisions come into force through administrative channels, although it acknowledges that this was made necessary by the impossibility in practice of exhausting the legal procedure for designating employers\' and workers\' representatives who, instead of being elected, were directly appointed by the most representative organisations. This sweeping grievance claims to be founded exclusively on two brief and incomplete quotations of the extensive observations drawn up by the ILO mission on industrial relations in Uruguay carried out in 1986, whose mandate expressly excluded the examination', ""85.On 26 August 1985, the Government sent information on Cases Nos. 1098, 1132, 1254, 1257, 1290, 1299 and 1316 concerning allegations of infringements of freedom of association presented by numerous workers' organisations. Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government assumed power on 1 March 1985 to halt the deterioration in the trade union situation in Uruguay and restore democracy. The Committee intends to examine all these cases, which relate to a trade union situation that arose under the regime that came to power as a result of the military takeover in 1973, in a single document.\n86.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n87.In its letter of 26 August 1985, the Government states that the process of institutionalising democracy, and therefore of remedying the trade union situation, began on 1 March 1985. It recalls that it sent a representative to the May 1985 meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments. The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before the Committee.\n94.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.\n95.The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the interested parties; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.\n96.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life of the country.(b) The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union situation.\n206.When the Committee examined these cases at its November 1984 meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations which were pending:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Cases Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt, in respect of whom it wished to be kept informed of any action taken) and that it has also expressed the hope that this request will be heeded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken in this regard.(b) With reference to the list of 34 trade unionists detained, tried or sentenced in respect of whom the Committee had requested the Government to indicate the concrete acts of which they were accused (Milton Morales - in detention, David Calleros, Jess Eguren, Jaime Lpez, Mara Martnez , Carlos Mechoso, Roberto Meirelles, Dimar Silva - all undergoing trial; Jorge Alvarez, Rubn Bello, Diego Brugnole, Jaime Bugarn, Julio Durante, Jos Glisenti, Carlos Goerrero, Miguel Guzmn, Yolanda Ibarra, Luis Iguini, Ral Larraya, Wilman Lasena, Francisco Laurenzo, Waldamar de Len, Len Lev, Miguel Longo, Francisco Maiorana, Guillermo Martiello, Leandro Moreira, Rogelio Ortiz, Norberto Quintana, Ramn R.

However, some of the other activities of which they are accused might have been carried out within the framework of trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to re-examine the situation of these persons with a view to the release of those who may have been detained for engaging in activities of a trade union character. It also requests that the Government supply information on this matter.\n207.In its communications of 12 and 26 March 1985 the Government states that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti is in hiding and that all the other persons mentioned by the complainants, with the exception of Rubn Bello and Len Lev (the latter of whom was sentenced for forgery) have been freed, some of them in application of the law of amnesty for political offences.\n208.In connection with the allegations which remained pending, the Committee notes with satisfaction the release of 41 of the 44 trade union leaders and trade unionists who had been arrested, brought to trial or sentenced, some of them as a result of the application of the law of amnesty for political offences. As regards the remaining three persons who had been sentenced, the Committee notes that Luis Washington Rodrguez Belleti (a sugar workers' leader) is in hiding and that Rubn Bello (a port workers' leader) and Len Lev (a member of a bank workers' union) are serving prison sentences (the latter for forgery).

The CPUSTAL supplied additional information in a letter dated 1 August 1977. The Government forwarded its observations by a communication dated 28 September 1977. On 12 October 1977 the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions submitted a complaint concerning which the Government has not yet transmitted its observations.\n372.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n373.The CPUSTAL alleged that the Police Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of non-existent laws, had pronounced judgement sentencing to two years' imprisonment, and fines of from 8,000 to 10,000 sucres, the President of the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), Juan Vasquez Bastidas, and the President of the National Union of Educators (UNE), Manuel Anton. These organisations are members of the CPUSTAL. The complainants added that these persons had not been given any sort of trial.\n374.The WFTU stated that the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL - had organised, on 18 May 1977, a 24-hour national strike in support of a claim for higher wages and other demands of an economic and social nature. The UNE, which has a membership of 60,000 teachers, called a work stoppage on the same day with a view to obtaining a salary rise and an increase in the national education budget. In response, added the WFTU, the Government issued a decree, No. 1475, conferring upon police intendants the status of special judges competent to try trade union officials and strikers under an expeditious procedure with no right of appeal. At the same time the Government instructed these police intendants to bring to trial the principal leaders of the three Confederations that had organised the national strike of 18 May, as well as officials of the UNE.\n375.Furthermore, continued the complainants, the Supreme Council of Government issued on 30 May 1977 a decree outlawing the UNE and providing for the custodianship of its funds. At the end of June, the General Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of the aforementioned Decree No. 1475, sentenced Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton to fines and imprisonment. The WFTU further mentioned the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guays who was to be tried under the same procedure.\n376.The Government, in a detailed reply to which were appended a large number of documents, emphasised that it was its policy to encourage the trade union movement in Ecuador. As evidence of this it pointed to the subsidy of 265,000 sucres that it paid to the country's trade union Confederations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, to cover the expenses of the 1 May rally. However, it continued, the leaders of these three Confederations had taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by this event - in which the majority of the participants had no connection with the trade union movement - to incite the workers to take part in a national work stoppage on 18 May 1977, based on a combat manifesto of nine points, not all of which related to industrial matters, and which were refuted one by one. Moreover, none of these demands had been put to the competent authorities through the proper legal channels.\n377.In the appendices to the Government's reply there was a list of these points and the arguments whereby the Government refuted them. These demands were as follows:\n378.The Government stated that the union leaders were allowed to prepare for the work stoppage in full freedom. They had access to the radio, television and the press at the national level. The Government further pointed out that it had recognised the workers' organisations without reservations. However, it could not fail in its moral and legal duty to preserve public order and ensure that citizens could live their lives normally in every respect. It could only condemn incitement to disorderly conduct and anarchy, whoever was responsible, and any attempt to undermine the functioning of the State by disregarding the procedures in force for dealing with all grievances, individual or collective. In substance, the Government enforced the regulations in force to defend its stability and ensure the preservation of public order and the safety of persons and property. It was these duties that the Government was performing in dealing with the events of 18 May 1977.\n379.The Government refuted the complainants' allegations completely. It claimed that these complaints were unfounded and did not mention a single specific case of infringement of the freedom of association Conventions. All persons living on the territory of a State, added the Government, were required to observe the laws of that country. Under Legislative Decree No. 105 of 7 June 1967, the instigators of a collective stoppage of work, and the ringleaders of such a stoppage, were liable to a fine of from 1,000 to 10,000 sucres and from two to five years' imprisonment. Persons who participated in such a work stoppage without having instigated it or being a ringleader were liable to a fine of from 200 to 1,000 sucres and from three months' to one year's imprisonment. A"", ""269.The Committee already examined this case in November 1977 and in May 1978. At these sessions, the Committee submitted interim conclusions in its 172nd Report (paragraphs 371 to 388) and 181st Report (paragraphs 196 to 210), respectively. The Governing Body approved the first report in November 1977 (204th Session) and the second in June 1978 (206th Session).\n270.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n271.This case is mainly concerned with a 24-hour general strike called on 18 May 1977 by the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), the Ecuadorian Confederation of Catholic Workers (CEDOC) and the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL) - and another strike organised on the same day by the National Union of Educators (UNE). Under an emergency procedure, these work stoppages led to the sentencing to fines and imprisonment of trade union officials, including Juan Vasquez Bastidas, President of the CTE, and Manuel Antn, President of the UNE, to the outlawing of the UNE and to the dismissal of a very large number of teachers. The complainants also referred to the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guayas.\n272.The Committee had noted that a number of the demands made in connection with the strike of 18 May 1977 were clearly occupational in character while others were not. As concerns the teachers, the Government explained that the UNE's membership embraced a substantial proportion of the teachers in the country's public education system. These teachers had decided to call a national work stoppage with a view to obtaining certain pecuniary advantages which the Government was not in a position to offer them. Nevertheless, continued the Government, the authorities had studied these demands in a desire to satisfy them as far as possible. Notwithstanding this, on the initiative of a few of its leaders, the UNE had launched itself into a national strike which had brought public schools and colleges throughout the country to a standstill for 30 days with the sole aim o?creating chaos, disrupting public order and attempting to shatter the peace and tranquillity of the Ecuadorian people. The Government had accordingly declared these events to be unlawful. The teaching profession is in fact governed by the Advancement and Wages Act, which enumerates the rights and duties which bind teachers to the State and prohibits strikes, work stoppages and other demonstrations of a political nature.\n273.The Government added that, in pursuance of Legislative Decree No. 105 of 7 June 1967, it had punished the ringleaders by dismissing them or transferring them to other provinces. However, it had immediately quashed these sanctions and reinstated 95 per cent of the teachers in their profession, in some cases in the same post. The competent authorities were moreover examining the cases of the remainder with a view to their reinstatement.\n274.In June 1978, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted the information supplied by the Government. It, however, drew the latter's attention to a certain number of considerations and principles. For example, the recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. The Committee has admitted that this right may be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service. However, such measures should be accompanied by adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and, in the final instance, by arbitration procedures in which the awards are binding in all cases upon both parties and are promptly and fully implemented. Moreover, the outlawing of the UNE in pursuance of a decree was in flagrant breach of Article 4 of Convention No. 87, which had been ratified by Ecuador. Dissolution by the executive branch Of the Government pursuant to a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not afford the right of defence and does not offer the necessary guarantees. In other words, trade unions should enjoy the protection of a normal judicial procedure where the national legislation provides for the dissolution (or suspension) of a trade union as a punishment for a serious breach of the law. Furthermore, the outlawing of the UNE was liable to deprive teachers in the public education sector of any representative organisation, since its membership embraced a substantial proportion of the teachers concerned. The Governing Body requested the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE and to supply information on any development in this connection.\n275.Juan Vasquez Bastidas, President of the CTE, and Manuel Antn, President of the UNE, had, according to the complainants, been sentenced to two years' imprisonment and to fines of from 8,000 to 10,000 sucres, in pursuance of the aforementioned Legislative Decree No. 105 and Presidential Decree No. 1475 of 25 May 1977. The first of these decrees punishes very severely and in very broad terms collective stoppages of work. The Committee expressed the opinion that it should be reviewed. The second, adopted only a few days after the strike of 18 May 1977, entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to minor breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal. The Committee expressed the view that this summary procedure lent itself to abuse and that all arrested trade unionists should be subject to normal judicial procedure guaranteeing the rights of defence and conforming to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As to Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guayas, the Government had supplied no further information.\n276.In June 1976, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, suggested to the Government that it reconsider the position of Juan Vasquez"", 'increase. It alleged that the Government had immediately reacted by applying Decrees Nos. 1475 and 1476, with the result that the UNE was dissolved and its national and regional leaders were jailed. They were sentenced to fines of from 2,000 to 8,000 sucres (80 to 350 United States dollars) and struck off the register of teachers forthwith, along with 500 of their colleagues. In a letter dated 4 November 1977, primarily concerned with another aspect of the trade union situation in Ecuador, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions mentioned these two decrees, which had, inter alia, resulted in the outlawing of the UNE (Decree No. 1476) and facilitated individual and ,collective dismissals, and the threatening, arrest or even murder of trade unionists.\n203.The Government explains, in its two communications, that the UNE\'s membership embraces a substantial proportion of the teachers in the country\'s public educational system. Contrary to the most elementary principles governing relations between the State and its servants, these teachers decided to call a national work stoppage with a view to obtaining certain pecuniary advantages which the Government was not in a position to offer them. Nevertheless, continues the Government, the authorities studied these demands in a desire to satisfy them as far as possible. Notwithstanding this, on the initiative of a few of its leaders, the UNE launched itself into a national strike which brought public schools and colleges throughout the country to a standstill for 30 days with the sole aim of creating chaos, disrupting public order and attempting to shatter the peace and tranquillity of the Ecuadorian people.\n204.This strike was qualified as illegal, adds the Government, by dozens of their fellow teachers who did not share the views of the majority. Moreover, the authorities reached the conclusion after several meetings with the leaders that this was merely a campaign to enlist sympathy for a few teachers who were bad servants of the State. The Government, accordingly, declares these events to be unlawful and tendentious under the terms of the law. The teaching profession is in fact governed by the Advancement and Wages Act, which enumerates the rights and duties which bind teachers to the State and prohibits strikes, work stoppages and other demonstrations of a political nature. Teachers are public servants and may not infringe the provisions of the law. They are protected by laws which are different from the national labour legislation. Consequently, the Government does not consider that it has infringed Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, which apply to workers covered by the Labour Code and not to public servants, such as teachers, who have a public and social function to perform - in this instance, the education of the country\'s children and adolescents. The Government adds that in pursuance of the aforementioned Legislative Decree No. 105, it punished the ringleaders by dismissing them or transferring them to other provinces. However, it immediately quashed these sanctions and reinstated 95 per cent of the teachers in their profession, in some cases in the same post. The competent authorities are examining the cases of the remainder with a view to their reinstatement.\n205.The Committee notes this information, and in particular that concerning the reinstatement of teachers in their profession. It wishes, first of all, to recall that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No. 87 apply to all workers, ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the \'State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category should be permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests.\n206.Nevertheless, as was made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No. 87,1 the recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. The Committee has admitted that this right could be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service. However, as the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases involving teachers in the public educational system, such measures should be accompanied by adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and, in the final instance, arbitration procedures in which the awards would be binding in all cases upon both parties and would be promptly and fully implemented.\n207.Following this strike, the Government outlawed the UNE in pursuance of a decree, which was tantamount to dissolving this organisation. In this connection, Article 4 of Convention No. 87 provides that workers\' and employers\' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved (or suspended) by administrative authority. The Committee has often pointed out that dissolution by the executive branch of the Government pursuant to a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not afford the right of defence and does not offer the necessary guarantees. In other words, trade unions should enjoy the protection of a normal judicial procedure where the national legislation provides for the dissolution (or suspension) of a trade union as a punishment for a serious breach of the law.\n208.The Committee recalls that in an earlier case relating Ecuador the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, inter alia drew the Government\'s attention to the aforementioned principle embodied in Article 4 of Convention No. 87, ratified by Ecuador, and urged that full effect be given to it. In the present case, there is also a risk that the outlawing of the UNE will deprive teachers in the public educational sector of any representative organisation, since, in the Government\'s own words, its membership embraces a substantial proportion of the teachers concerned.\n209.The Government has supplied no further information with respect to Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Manuel Anton and Julio Ayala Serra.\n210.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the information supplied by the Government concerning the reinstatement of the teachers dismissed for going on strike;(b) to suggest again to the Government that it reconsider the position']"

On that occasion, the Committee noted that the Government had pointed out that the administrative authorities took note of the by-laws on 14 August 2002 and that the complainant organization raised objections concerning certain aspects of a subsequent decision of the administrative authority on this question, in particular, to the extent in which they require that the trade union s objectives should be limited to the federal level. The Committee also noted that the Government stated that the trade union in question is registered at the federal level and that, as a general rule, the construction industry falls within the competence of the local authorities except in cases of works undertaken in the federal zone. In this respect, the Committee invited the complainant organization to provide clarifications, if it considered it appropriate, on the aspects of the administrative authority s decision that it contest, in the light of the latest observations made by the Government [see 329th Report, paras. 80-85].\n110.In its communication dated 6 January 2003, the complainant organization states that in August 2002 the Under-Secretariat for Labour instructed the Directorate-General for the Registration of Associations to take note of the amendments to the by-laws, and the latter issued a resolution in which it appears to comply with the aforementioned instruction. However, in its resolution the Directorate-General for the Registration of Associations added that:... in order for this department to be able to initial each and every part of these amended by-laws with the aim of guaranteeing the legal security of the interested parties, a copy of the said by-laws must be presented to this authority, containing written mention in article 8 of the by-laws of the fact that the trade union s objectives shall correspond to industrial construction works or enterprises falling within the competence of the federal authorities, or which are being undertaken or are operating in federal zones, or which operate under federal concession, given that the trade union in question is registered with the federal authority.The complainant organization alleges that the resolution issued by the Directorate-General for the Registration of Associations has no legal basis, as it imposes conditions that the union cannot possibly meet, because the text of the proposed addition to the amended by?laws has neither been authorized nor agreed on by the union s members, it being unlawful for the authorities to attempt to impose their own criteria on the by-laws of workers' trade union organizations. The resolution which was issued establishes a clause, the sole objective of which is to nullify the amparo decision (enforcement of constitutional rights) that was issued by attempting to impose amendments and objectives which were never agreed on, constituting a violation of the freedom of association of the workers belonging to the trade union and their right to draw up or amend the by-laws of their organizations.\n111.In its communication dated 26 May 2003, the Government summarizes its earlier declarations and states that the Progressive Trade Union of Workers of the Construction Industry of the Mexican Republic interprets national legislation inaccurately and, as a consequence, the requirement by the Directorate-General for the Registration of Associations that the Progressive Trade Union of Workers of the Construction Industry of the Mexican Republic provide them with a copy of their by-laws stipulating in article 8 that the objectives of the union correspond to construction works undertaken within federal zones, industries or enterprises falling within the competence of the federal authorities, or which operate under a federal concession, is in accordance with the practice in Mexico whereby the application of labour standards is carried out at two levels ' the federal and the local ' in accordance with the distribution of powers laid out in article 123, section A, Part XXXI of the Political Constitution of the United States of Mexico and section 527 of the Federal Labour Law. The Progressive Trade Union of Workers of the Construction Industry must specify that its objective corresponds to construction works undertaken within federal zones, industries or enterprises falling within the competence of the federal authorities, or which operate under federal concession, in order to prove that it is operating under the jurisdiction of the federal labour authorities, to safeguard the federal agreement enshrined in article 124 of the Political Constitution of the United States of Mexico, which establishes that those powers not expressly conferred on federal officials are understood to be reserved to the States.\n112.The Government emphasizes that in its ruling of 6 June 2002, the First Circuit Tenth Collegiate Court for Labour Affairs decided that the administrative resolution being challenged should be vacated, and, in its place, the Under-Secretariat for Labour should issue another, in which it examines with full jurisdiction the conformity of the proposed by-law amendments and, with full autonomy, soundly and on justifiable grounds, decides what is in accordance with the law, without basing its decision on the provisions of article 360 of the Federal Labour Law as these are not applicable to by-law amendments. It is clear from this that the authority which ruled in the amparo proceedings simply decided that the resolution issued by the Directorate-General for the Registration of Associations on 19 October 2002 should be vacated and that another resolution not based on article 360 of the Federal Labour Law should be issued. The Directorate-General for the Registration of Associations fully respected this final judgement, complying with it through the resolution it issued on 14 August 2002.\n113.The Government concludes that the labour authorities have complied with the law and have implemented the rulings handed down by the courts. Furthermore, at no time have they contravened the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3 and 7 of"", ""the general working conditions in the company, which verified the existence of 2,404 workers (1,720 men and 684 women), registered with the Mexican Social Security Institute, the existence of a collective labour agreement duly registered with the labour authority, and it was confirmed that the workers knew the name of the union of which they were members and the content of the collective labour agreement applicable to them and had access to it (copies were distributed to workers and kept available in freely accessible spaces).\n28.Based on the information above, the Government considers that these cases prove that state institutions function adequately and give due attention to the claims of the unions concerned. Furthermore, it recalls that new efforts have been undertaken to make the work of the labour authorities more efficient and timely and to consolidate the prompt and unimpeded administration of labour justice, including through national coordination mechanisms to improve the pursuit and administration of day-to-day justice in Mexico and the recent update to the labour regulations framework by means of the 2017 constitutional reform on labour justice administration.\n29.In communications dated 3 and 30 July 2018, IndustriALL provides its observations and further information regarding the follow-up of the case. IndustriALL reports that, despite the reforms and other measures announced by the Government, the practice of employer protection agreements is continuing and expanding, as evidenced by the specific situations it presents in relation to the complaint. As a reminder, IndustriALL condemns the system under which such protection agreements reportedly continue to operate, emphasizing that: (i) the agreements are a clear result of cooperation between the Government (which would approve employer protection agreements in return for political favours ' while acting as employer, judge and litigant in the authorities responsible for administering justice), corporate federations (which are deeply embedded in political and economic decision making bodies) and certain companies (which maintain lower operating costs and control over their workforce as these agreements protect the employer from having to negotiate with genuine unions), thus preventing workers from exercising their right to freedom of association; (ii) the protection union that will administer the collective agreement is selected before the employer even begins operations; and (iii) if workers try to organize themselves, the authorities, employers and corporate federations work together to ensure they are not successful, using methods which range from postponing proceedings to dismissals and all types of threats and assaults. In addition, it challenges the effectiveness and authenticity of the measures announced by the Government to combat this deep-rooted practice, alleging that these changes are designed to allow the situation to remain unchanged, emphasizing that: (i) union information and collective agreements are not published or available, as reported by the Government; (ii) proceedings continue to last for an average of five years; (iii) meetings with Mexican unions in relation to the complaint did not address the issue of protection unions; (iv) while the constitutional reform is presented as a panacea, in reality it is an illusion, as demonstrated by the bill formulated to implement the reform, which was presented by senators who are members of corporate federations and therefore reproduces the system of collective protection agreements; and (v) the 2016 protocol on free collective bargaining is no more than a sham as: the inspection dates are decided in advance with the company; the workers questioned during the inspection are selected by the trade union representative and/or the employer (questions simply regarding whether the worker in question is aware of their union and its statutes, whether he or she is aware of the collective agreement and whether the agreement is accessible to workers, in a clear location in the workplace). IndustriALL considers that if a collective employer protection agreement is in place in that workplace (as, according to the complainant, is the case for 90 per cent of workplaces) the replies are controlled by the protection union, rendering the protocol useless. In addition, in order to demonstrate the deficiencies of the public mechanisms, IndustriALL reports that, in response to the impunity and passivity of the labour authorities, a committee of civil society organizations has been established in the textile industry that includes 14 international brands and which carried out a  Campaign for freedom of association in Mexico' with the objective of  challenging the use of protection agreements in their supply chains'  These brands have worked on their own initiative to implement independent monitoring and audits to verify the compliance of their internal codes of conduct with the ILO fundamental Conventions, in particular to address the issue of protection agreements and ensure that the supplier companies with which they have production contracts understand and respect the right to freedom of association. In several cases these private initiatives have managed to resolve serious issues related to rights, dismissals and harassment in factories where protection unions operated.\n30.In addition, IndustriALL provides further information regarding specific situations highlighted in the Committee s previous examination of the complaint and on new cases. With respect to previously presented cases, on which the Government has provided its observations, the complainant indicates that:(a)\tRegarding the STUHM, challenging the Government s report, it emphasizes that: (i) the JFCA ordered the recount within the company and without reliable documentation on the voter register; (ii) during the recount entry was denied to the team of national and international observers and STUHM representatives (union representatives were threatened with firearms by the plant s security personnel when they demanded to be granted entry and they were only permitted to enter following heated arguments and complaints); (iii) throughout the whole procedure inside the plant representatives of the union in question, the Union of Employees and Workers in the Vehicle Manufacturing and Assembly Industry (SETEAMI), and the company continuously threatened the workers with dismissal if they lost the recount; (iv) the list of voters contained persons who should not have voted and company personnel selected those who could access the voting area, which was isolated from the rest of the plant and surrounded by internal security personnel;"", ""26.The Committee last examined the substance of this case at its June 2017 meeting [see 382nd Report, para. 130]. On that occasion, the Committee indicated that it would proceed with the examination of this case in relation to the specific allegations of violations of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining arising from protection agreements and to the issues concerning anti-union discrimination. The Committee requested the Government to provide all supplementary and relevant up-to-date information on the various allegations made by IndustriALL of specific situations involving the use of protection agreements, so that the Committee would have access to all relevant information when it next examined the follow-up of the case. In addition, the Committee referred the legislative aspects of the case on the application of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n27.In its communication of 1 February 2018, the Government sent information regarding the follow-up given to the Committee s recommendations in relation to the specific situations raised by IndustriALL in its previous communications:(a)\tHonda Mexico United Workers' Union (STUHM): the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JFCA) heard the case related to the title to the collective agreement filed by the STUHM, carrying out in due time and form each step of the procedure established in legislation: (i) the vote recount was conducted on 15 October 2015 in the best possible conditions, without any duly substantiated or validated objections and in the presence of three JFCA certifying officers, the Secretary-General for Agreements, Conciliation and Collective Issues, two federal labour inspectors, eight observers representing foreign trade unions, the secretaries general and representatives of the unions and representatives of the company; (ii) the recount was carried out in accordance with the law in a peaceful and orderly manner, and of the 1,829 workers present, 788 voted for STUHM and 1,001 for the defendant trade union; (iii) when it discovered that the recount was not in its favour, the STUHM filed direct amparo proceedings with the first district labour court of the federal district, which were dismissed, confirming that the JFCA had acted in strict compliance with the law; and (iv) regarding the alleged existence of a presumed conflict of interest on the part of the individual who acted as coordinator for the advisers to the President of the JFCA, the board advised on 25 May 2016 that the individual in question did not perform that public function and there was therefore no conflict of interest.(b)\tCommercial, Office, Retail, Similar and Allied Workers' Union (STRACC): (i) on 28 March 2017, STRACC was granted the title to the collective agreement; and (ii) the parties who had been sued by STRACC lodged appeals for amparo (Nos DT 661/2017, DT 660/2017 and DT 659/2017), which were unsuccessful and therefore did not adversely affect the STRACC.(c)\tNational Union of Petroleum Technicians and Professionals (UNTyPP): (i) since 25 March 2010, Petrleos Mexicanos (PEMEX, hereinafter the oil company) and the UNTyPP have held more than 15 meetings in which issues raised by the UNTyPP have been addressed, including the dismissal of workers ' agreeing to discuss the possibility of rehiring those worker members of the UNTyPP who were affected by the aforementioned movements; (ii) this case was analysed as part of the round table discussions held since 2012 by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (STPS) with the National Union of Workers ' the STPS has facilitated meetings between the UNTyPP and the management of the company in which employment files were analysed, leading to the reinstatement and retirement of several UNTyPP members, in the interest of mediating a settlement to the disputes, on 7 July 2015 the Deputy Minister for Labour addressed a communication to the chief executive officer of the company voicing the UNTyPP s concerns regarding the new collective labour agreement;

The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n17.In February 1977 the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No. 14256 of 31 December 1976, whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n18.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April 1977, the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June 1977 session, the Governing Body stressed that the miners' broadcasting stations should be rapidly returned to the workers and their organisations.\n19.The Committee and the Governing Body also noted the new measures as a result of which some trade unionists - arrested or exiled as a result of the events in the mining industry - had been released or had been able to return to the country. They requested the Government to continue its re-examination of the situation of the other workers and trade union leaders still under arrest or exiled.\n20.In a more recent complaint dated 7 June 1977 (with which the WFTU associated itself), the Miners' Trade Unions International referred to the detention of Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, who was said to be undergoing torture, as a result of which his health had seriously deteriorated. He was allegedly incarcerated in the prison belonging to the Department of Public Order (DOP) in La Paz. The complainants demanded that he be released, along with the many other mining trade unionists who were in prison, and that a stop be put to the repression directed against the miners who had been calling for better living and working conditions.The latest observations from the Government\n21.The Government stated in its letter of 3 August 1977 that Mario Cortez had been released in May 1977; it added that while he was in custody he was in good health, and that the Government had no knowledge of any subsequent illness. His detention had nothing to do with trade union matters, but was due to the political work of subversive agitation in which Mario Cortez had been engaged in the mines.\n22.In its telegram of 1 October 1977, the Government supplied a further list of mineworkers who had been arrested on political grounds, according to the Government, and had now been released:Roberto Acho Huarita; Juan Alfaro Moreira; Jaime Bernal Alvarado; Alberto Camacho Pardo; Gregorio Colque Capacalle; Mario Cortez Cabrere (see preceding paragraph); Simn Chumacero Facio; Freddy Ferrufino Guzmn; Isaac Gonzlez Cabezas; Manuel Hernndez Veizaga; Armando Iporre Zegarra; Hugo Marne Terrazas; Severo Mendoza Chino; Adolfo Morales Gmez; Victor Orellana Hinojosa; Paulino Palma Lpez (since rearrested, however); Serafn Ramos Quiroz; Gonzal Rivas Mercado; Fabian Romero Gmez; Delfn Saldano Hidaldo; Teodoro Sarmiento Choque; Hugo Serrano Sanjinez; Efran Velasco Gutirrez; Milan Velasquez Jauregui; Germn Zambrana Serrudo; Wilfredo Zambrana Serrudo.The Government also mentioned the names of five trade union leaders or workers in the mining sector who had been able to return from exile. The Committee notes that this latter information has already been transmitted in earlier communications.\n23.In more general terms, the Government referred, in its communication of 1 October 1977, to a speech made on 16 July 1977 by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court.

His detention had nothing to do with trade union matters, but was due to the political work of subversive agitation in which Mario Cortez had been engaged in the mines.\n22.In its telegram of 1 October 1977, the Government supplied a further list of mineworkers who had been arrested on political grounds, according to the Government, and had now been released:Roberto Acho Huarita; Juan Alfaro Moreira; Jaime Bernal Alvarado; Alberto Camacho Pardo; Gregorio Colque Capacalle; Mario Cortez Cabrere (see preceding paragraph); Simn Chumacero Facio; Freddy Ferrufino Guzmn; Isaac Gonzlez Cabezas; Manuel Hernndez Veizaga; Armando Iporre Zegarra; Hugo Marne Terrazas; Severo Mendoza Chino; Adolfo Morales Gmez; Victor Orellana Hinojosa; Paulino Palma Lpez (since rearrested, however); Serafn Ramos Quiroz; Gonzal Rivas Mercado; Fabian Romero Gmez; Delfn Saldano Hidaldo; Teodoro Sarmiento Choque; Hugo Serrano Sanjinez; Efran Velasco Gutirrez; Milan Velasquez Jauregui; Germn Zambrana Serrudo; Wilfredo Zambrana Serrudo.The Government also mentioned the names of five trade union leaders or workers in the mining sector who had been able to return from exile. The Committee notes that this latter information has already been transmitted in earlier communications.\n23.In more general terms, the Government referred, in its communication of 1 October 1977, to a speech made on 16 July 1977 by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court. He stated that the Government was preparing for Bolivia's return to a Constitutional regime, which would enable the country to accede, through the free expression of the will of the people, to a qualitatively more advanced level. Before returning to a Constitutional regime in the"", ""unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n16.In November 1976 the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n17.In February 1977 the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No. 14256 of 31 December 1976, whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n18.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April 1977, the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June 1977 session, the Governing Body stressed that the miners' broadcasting stations should be rapidly returned to the workers and their organisations.\n19.The Committee and the Governing Body also noted the new measures as a result of which some trade unionists - arrested or exiled as a result of the events in the mining industry - had been released or had been able to return to the country. They requested the Government to continue its re-examination of the situation of the other workers and trade union leaders still under arrest or exiled.\n20.In a more recent complaint dated 7 June 1977 (with which the WFTU associated itself), the Miners' Trade Unions International referred to the detention of Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, who was said to be undergoing torture, as a result of which his health had seriously deteriorated. He was allegedly incarcerated in the prison belonging to the Department of Public Order (DOP) in La Paz. The complainants demanded that he be released, along with the many other mining trade unionists who were in prison, and that a stop be put to the repression directed against the miners who had been calling for better living and working conditions.The latest observations from the Government\n21.The Government stated in its letter of 3 August 1977 that Mario Cortez had been released in May 1977; it added that while he was in custody he was in good health, and that the Government had no knowledge of any subsequent illness.

These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated 15 October 1985, the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about 30 days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line 21) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated 30 October 1985 in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n530.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them.

The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos. 1204 and 1341.\n533.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities.

These allegations, which constitute Case No. 620, will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of 15 September 1970.\n40.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n49.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to take note of the fact that it would appear from the information supplied by the Government that all effects of the measures denounced in the allegations have now ceased, and to decide, subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph 43, that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the intention of the Government to make trade union membership compulsory and to create a single union, to decide, while reaffirming the principles set forth in paragraph 47, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n316.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these five cases are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegation. The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated 13 and 23 January 1969, one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated 10 January 1969, one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated 22 February 1969, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated 15 March 1969, one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated 9 June 1969 and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated 30 September 1969.\n317.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated 21 and 28 January 1970.\n318.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n319.In its communication dated 13 January 1969 the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated 23 January 1969 the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October 1968 had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n320.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of 23 February 1969 that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since 15 December 1968. The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n321.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated 14 March 1969 that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n322.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of 9 June 1969 that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.\n323.Lastly, the National Federation of"", ""37.The Committee last examined this case at its session in February 1970, when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which is contained in paragraphs 316 to 330 of its 116th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its 178th Session (March 1970).\n38.A number of allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises remained outstanding, with respect to which the Government has now forwarded its observations by a communication dated 15 September 1970.\n39.In addition, on 16 and 20 January 1970, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) made further allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights in connection with the Government's intention to make trade union membership compulsory and create a single union.

The Committee also requests the complainant to confirm whether complaints against the dismissals have been lodged with the competent judicial authority.(g)\tThe Committee firmly expects the Government to fully ensure adequate protection for ASIC officials against any acts of interference in their trade union activities, including in the circumstances described by the Government.\n337.In its communications, the complainant organization alleges the proliferation of anti-union harassment with the aim, as reportedly stated by police officers, of supressing and eliminating ASIC. The complainant organization specifically alleges:The anti-union dismissal of two members of ASIC (trade union activist, Mr Ismael Valentn Castro, and the head of Mujeres Trabajadoras (Women Workers) in the province of Villa Clara, Ms Dania Noriega), following inspections conducted at the end of March 2021 by officials from the Department of State Security (DSE) at their workplace, the Brisas del Mar hotel complex, in the municipality of Caibarin, in the Villa Clara province. The complainant organization reports that: (i) three officials dressed as civilians approached Mr Valentn Castro and told him that they knew who he was and advised him to leave and to stop working in order to avoid any further issues; (ii) Ms Noriega received an audit which resulted in a fine of 2,500 Cuban pesos (equivalent to a monthly minimum wage) ' although they told her that they knew she was an opponent and that if she handed in her resignation, nothing would happen and that they would not apply the fine, which, in the end, was imposed and paid through the ASIC solidarity fund'  and (iii) subsequently, the DSE officials forced the administration to dismiss both trade unionists and to disguise the dismissals as the result of restructuring. The complainant organization notes that no explanation is provided as to the legal grounds on which the dismissal was based, other than a vague reference to legislation, applied by the employer in a discretionary manner. It also states that this is a common practice against ASIC activists and officials: when they are found to be participating in trade union activities, they are penalized or removed from their posts without justification (communication dated 7 April 2021).The increased harassment, surveillance and persecution of the ASIC general secretary, Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, by the police, to the point where he feared for his physical safety and life. The complainant organization reports that: (i) Mr Hernndez s home is strictly monitored and every time that he leaves, he is overtly followed (with close physical contact) by State security agents; (ii) the situation has worsened, with the receipt of anonymous messages on social media making death threats against him, which, ASIC states, come from police intelligence agencies for the purpose of harassment and intimidation; and (iii) as has now become customary, these measures were accompanied by threats to send him back to prison (the general secretary served eight and a half of the 25 years to which he was sentenced as part of the spring repression of 2003, and was granted parole (licencia extrapenal) (communication of 12 May 2021).The cyber lockout experienced by the ASIC general secretary on 29 June 2021 when attempting to access the webinar organized by the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Cuba (GIRSCC) and the French Democratic Confederation of Labour, on the subject of bilateral relations between the European Union and Cuba, the current status of labour relations in Cuba and fundamental labour rights. The complainant organization alleges that: (i) the ASIC general secretary attempted on several occasions to connect to Zoom to attend the aforementioned event but was prevented from accessing it by an error message; (ii) in anticipation of this situation,"", 'stated that:- according to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), Ms. Edith Lupe, Organization Secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC, was summoned to appear on 24 May 1994 at the Department of State Security, located in the Capri district, in the Havana municipality of Arroyo Naranjo, by the commander of this body. Inside the aforementioned premises, the officer threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Ms. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, Officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"";- on 2 August 1994, on Avenida 19 of the Siboney district, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras, General Secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault is the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lzaro Corp.\n211.Furthermore, in its last communication, dated 7 July 1995, the complainant organization had alleged that:- the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is the case of Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln (President), Jess Crdenas Lpez (Vice-President) and Ren Jos Montero Garay (Secretary responsible for International Relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration;- on 29 September 1994, at 1 p.m., Mr. Ren Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones at the corner of Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that he himself and Martnez Guilln and Jess Crdenas would be sentenced to 12 and 15 years\' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued defending the Cuban working class. Moreover, on 10 November 1994, at 2.40 p.m., Mr. Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln, President of the CTDC, and Mr. Jess Crdenas Lpez, Vice-President of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation;- according to the complainant organization\'s sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n212.In its reply, the Government cited the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n213.Referring to various allegations, the Government made the following observations:- the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On 24 May, she was summoned to the 9th station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in the Capri district, and was given a warning for having carried provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August 1994;- as regards Lzaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lzaro Corp Yeras left the country in September 1994, when he went to live in the United States;- the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give', 'she left the cell, officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"".\n405.The ICFTU also alleges during the week of 4-9 July 1994 that CTDC officials were the victims of a violent demonstration by the so-called ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the residence of Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC. The dissidents Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also at her residence at the time. Officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba participated in this demonstration.\n406.Furthermore, on 2 August 1994, in the Avenida 19 del Rpto. Siboney, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault, the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lazaro Corp, once again shows the flagrant violation by the Government of Cuba of internationally recognized trade union rights and principles.\n407.After condemning the terrible harassment to which independent trade unionists in Cuba are subject, and which has often been denounced by the ICFTU, this organization emphasizes the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba.\n408.In its communication of 7 July 1995, the ICFTU alleges that the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is especially the case of Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen (president), Jesus Crdenas Lpez (vice-president) and Rene Jos Montero Garay (secretary responsible for international relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain its legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration.\n409.The ICFTU states that on 29 September 1994, at 1 p.m., Mr. Rene Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones esquine Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that both he himself and Martinez Guillen and Jesus Crdenas would be sentenced to 12-15 years\' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued their defence of the Cuban working class. Moreover, on 10 November 1994, at 2.40 p.m., Messrs. Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen, President of the CTDC, and Jesus Crdenas Lpez, vice-president of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation.\n410.The ICFTU also states that, according to its sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization, in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was both small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n411.In its communication of 13 July 1995, the Government explains that the delay in sending its reply was due mainly to the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the communication from the ICFTU, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n412.That being said, the Government adds that the inquiries carried out on the basis of the scant information contained in the complaint have shown that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez could not complete his plans to travel to a foreign country since at that time he was on bail pending legal proceedings against him in the criminal courts. Mr. Rafael Gutierrez subsequently left the country on the dates given by the ICFTU in its communication.\n413.The Government adds that the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On 24 May, she was summoned to the ninth station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in Reparto Capri, and was given a warning for having carried out provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States.

The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.\n316.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No. 1273 was last examined at its February 1992 meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see 281st Report of the Committee, paras. 270 to 281, approved by the Governing Body at its 252nd Session (March 1992)). Cases Nos. 1441 and 1494 were last examined at its November 1991 meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see 279th Report of the Committee, paras. 519 to 543, approved by the Governing Body at its 251st Session (November 1991)). Case No. 1524 was last examined at its February 1992 meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see 281st Report of the Committee, paras. 282 to 294, approved by the Governing Body at its 252nd Session (March 1992)).\n317.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated 17 December 1991 and 19 August 1992.\n318.The Government sent partial information in communications dated 15 and 26 May 1992.\n319.In addition, the Committee requested the Government, in February, May and November 1991 and in February and May 1992, to accept a direct contacts mission (see 277th Report, para. 382, 278th Report, para. 7, 279th Report, para. 543, 281st Report, paras. 281 and 294, and 283rd Report, para. 9).\n320.Owing to the lack of detailed information from the Government concerning the allegations, the Committee has had to adjourn these four cases on several occasions, finally making an urgent appeal to the Government at its November 1992 meeting (see 284th Report, para. 10). In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph 17 of its 127th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.\n321.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No. 87), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n333.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.\n334.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. 31, approved by the Governing Body in March 1952).\n335.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.\n336.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October 1989 which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) commission ad hoc failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.\n337.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.\n338.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that 23 members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the corresponding court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette"", ""attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February 1991 by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee. The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.\n316.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No. 1273 was last examined at its February 1992 meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see 281st Report of the Committee, paras. 270 to 281, approved by the Governing Body at its 252nd Session (March 1992)).

Moreover, at its November 1985 meeting, the Committee expressed the hope that the direct contacts mission would be able to obtain information on the allegation pending in connection with Case No. 1307 (see 241st Report, para. 749). Finally, an allegation made in the context of Case No. 1268 was still pending before the Committee (see 234th Report, para. 384).\n420.At the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference (Geneva, 1985) the Government representative of Honduras formally requested that the direct contacts be carried out in order to elucidate the situation and to bring the country\'s legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.\n421.Subsequently, the Government of Honduras, in a communication dated 29 November 1985, agreed that the mission should take place from 7 to 11 January 1986.\n422.The Director-General of the ILO appointed as his representative to carry out this mission Mr. Andrs Aguilar, ex-president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and a member of that Commission and the Committee on Human Rights. The mission took place in Tegucigalpa on the dates mentioned above. Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards, accompanied the representative of the Director-General during the mission.\n423.The mission held talks with His Excellency Mr. Amado H.

The Committee notes with interest the fact that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission. In this connection the Committee notes that the information obtained during the mission on the disappearance of two trade union leaders referred to in the complaints does not contain any new elements.\n428.When the Committee considered this case at its May 1985 meeting (see 239th Report, paras. 243-258) two matters were still pending. First, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the alleged murder of Jacobo Hernndez, a trade union leader of the Honduran National Peasants\' Association (ANACH), and had called attention to the need to carry out judicial inquiries in that regard. The Committee had also requested the Government to supply information on the latest developments in the proceedings concerning the murder of Dagoberto Padilla, Ismael Ulloa, Angel Alvarado and Carlos Alcides Meja, and on the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figueroa, all leaders or members of the Workers\' Union of the Agricultural and Cattle Raising Company of Sula (SITRACOAGS). The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated 11 October 1985, presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers\' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the 105th Infantry Brigade.\n429.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on 28 March 1983 against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.\n430.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: (1) of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; (2) those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; (3) Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.\n431.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and', '419.The Committee on Freedom of Association at its meeting in May 1985, in considering the cases concerning Honduras (Nos. 1216 and 1271) requested the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, given the gravity of the allegations and the lack of information available concerning Case No. 1216 (see 239th Report of the Committee, para. 258), and in order that the various aspects of Case No. 1271 might be fully examined (see 239th Report, para. 275) .

The Committee had stressed the seriousness of the allegation that the manager and owners of SITRACOAGS were involved in the murder and attempted murders and considered that since it was a penal matter it should be subject to a criminal investigation. It therefore urged the Government to provide information on this investigation. Finally, subsequent to the latest examination of the case by the Committee, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a communication dated 11 October 1985, presented new allegations concerning the disappearance of Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero, President of the ""El Mochito"" Mineworkers\' Union, who was reported by the ICFTU to have been detained by soldiers of the 105th Infantry Brigade.\n429.Concerning the death of Mr. Jacobo Hernndez, the ANACH union leader, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, proceedings commenced on 28 March 1983 against Mr. Marco Tulio Pineda Torres (at present detained in the central penitentiary of Tegucigalpa) for the crime of homicide.\n430.Regarding the murder of four SITRACOAGS leaders and the attempted murder of three other leaders of that organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the relevant trial for murder or attempted murder is still at the indictment stage. The Committee also takes note of the various developments that have taken place in that trial: (1) of those who were earlier detained on charges of murder, Mr. Alfredo Villeda Henrquez and Mr. Moiss Orellana have been found not guilty of criminal liability; (2) those charged with the attempted murder of Pedro Chavarra, Jacobo Nez and Eulogio Figuera are the subject of warrants of arrest; (3) Mr. Marco Antonio Molina and Mr. Fausto Isal Garca are still fugitives from justice and before escaping from prison they confessed to the judicial authorities that they had committed the murders, as may be seen from the court documents given to the mission.\n431.As to the involvement of the manager (Mr. Carlos Gonzlez) and the owners of the Agricultural and']"

The restricted email sent to a group of members of SINAUT SINAT (totalling 1,490) could not be delivered to 946 members, which means that an email must be sent  several times to a smaller number of addressees'  as explained in the last part of the email itself. This restriction was imposed on all of the officials of SINAUT SUNAT.\n1190.Lastly, in letter No. 150-2010-SUNAT/2F3000 dated 7 September 2010, the department of personnel management of SUNAT issued an express and definitive prohibition on the use of institutional email, including a ban on the use of email for purely trade union purposes. This decision was taken precisely a time when the list of demands presented by SINAUT SUNAT for the period 2010-11 was being negotiated, as may be seen from the following: (i) the list of demands itself, presented by SINAUT SUNAT on 3 March 2010; (ii) the record of the opening session of direct bargaining on the list of demands for 2010' 1, dated 22 April 2010; (iii) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 11 June 2010; (iv) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 24 June 2010; (v) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 12 July 2010; (vi) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 22 July 2010; (vii) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 10 August 2010; (viii) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 19 August 2010; (ix) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 1 September 2010; and (x) the record of the conciliation procedure dated 8 September 2010; this being a period when the members of the bargaining committee needed to communicate with the other members of the union to inform them of the agreements reached, hold consultations and receive suggestions in order to take decisions representing the intentions of all of the members.\n1191.The complainant organization adds that SUNAT has displayed an evident lack of interest in communicating with SINAUT SUNAT. The representatives of the union have attempted to meet with representatives of the employer in order to resolve, through direct coordination, the difficulties faced by the workers of SUNAT, which they express through the union. However, SUNAT has not taken an interest in holding the meetings requested, displaying an evident lack of interest in resolving the difficulties faced by its workers and expressed through the union. Moreover, states the complainant, SUNAT refuses to grant the trade union the facilities necessary to enable it to function normally (such as additional trade union leave, leave to attend events, recognition of trade union immunity of the members of the executive committee, delegates, deputy delegates and coordinators, access to SUNAT premises to communicate with members, provision of an office for the trade union in the institution, installation of an email account for the union, and authorization of the use of certain SUNAT premises and equipment for trade union activities, authorization to distribute information on SUNAT premises).\n1192.The complainant organization adds that SUNAT has violated the trade union immunity of the deputy general secretary of SINAUT SUNAT. On 23 October 2009 issued an unexpected order for the removal of Mr Edmstines Montoya Jara, deputy general secretary of SINAUT SUNAT, from his post as professional supervisor of the Ad Hoc Public Prosecutor s Office of SUNAT, transferring him to the post of resolution auditor in Division III of the Complaints Department of the Office of Major National Taxpayers of SUNAT, which is at a lower grade (the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion, in violation report No. 2482-2009-MTPE/2/12.3 of 2 December 2009 and a subsequent subdirectorate decision, recognized unfair treatment to the detriment of the deputy general secretary of SINAUT SUNAT, sanctioned SUNAT for the violations and warned it to change its unlawful conduct; however, SUNAT has not done this to date). The complainant organization states further that SUNAT has taken retaliatory action against the organizing secretary of SINAUT SUNAT, Mr Pedro ngel Chilet Paz, deputy general secretary of SINAUT SUNAT-TI. The latter filed judicial proceedings against SUNAT, requesting that his wages be adjusted to that of other employees in the institution performing the same duties, which involves restoring his wages, also affecting his social benefits. As a result, SUNAT instituted disciplinary proceedings against Mr Chilet Paz, alleging that he was guilty of misconduct for having submitted in his court proceedings copies of payslips of SUNAT employees performing the same duties but earning higher pay. The proceedings initiated by SUNAT are intended as an act of retaliation against the worker for his activity as a union representative, for his participation in collective bargaining for the period 201011 and for having instituted legal proceedings against his employer to obtain his employment entitlements that have not been recognized (the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion, in violation report No. 1458-2010-MTPE/2/12.3 of 22 July 2010, recognized unfair treatment to the detriment of the secretary of SINAUT SUNAT and proposed the imposition of a penalty for the violations committed, but there has been no change in the unlawful situation).\n1193.The complainant organization states that SUNAT has committed the following unlawful acts against the general secretary of SINAUT SUNAT: (a) unlawful caution to Ms Paola Aliaga Huatuco to comply with her working hours, despite the fact that her post is not subject to supervision, according to the employer itself; and (b) disproportionate evaluation and appraisal of Ms Paola Aliaga Huatuco s performance during the period from January to December 2009. In addition, SUNAT issued unlawful written warnings in the form of cautions to union representatives in the Cajamarca office (Mr Manuel Oswaldo Solano Dvila and Mr Eleodoro Amrico Paredes Fabin) and to the"", ""worker, as SUNAT must exercise its managerial prerogative, through its representatives and within the legal framework of the tasks performed and assigned, bearing in mind that for staff who are not subject to direct supervision this prerogative is limited and subject to conditions. The orders issued must thus refer to the work being done or be inherently related to that work, and therefore must be obeyed by staff within the purview of the managerial prerogative; (b) disproportionate evaluation and appraisal of the performance of Ms Paola Aliaga Huatuco during the period from January to December 2009. SUNAT maintains that the performance evaluation of Ms Paola Aliaga Huatuco was carried out in accordance with the Rules on annual performance evaluation, based on objective criteria and in the light of evaluation factors and levels of competence for each one. The evaluation factors are: (i) technical and functional knowledge; (ii) organization of work; (iii) communication; (iv) work attitude. Ms Aliaga s performance evaluation for 2009 was as follows: technical and functional knowledge ' B; organization of work ' C; communication ' B; and work attitude ' C. SUNAT adds that in view of Ms Paola Aliaga Huatuco s disagreement and in accordance with the procedure laid down in the abovementioned Rules, an appeals board was set up, which reviewed and evaluated the arguments and evidence presented. The investigation was completed on 23 July 2010 and Ms Aliaga was informed of the result on 25 August 2010: the appeal was declared receivable in part and the grade C for the  organization of work' factor upheld. It is thus not correct to assert that the reason for Ms Aliaga s negative evaluation was her activity as a trade union official, as the evaluation was based on objective criteria and the procedure followed for her evaluation and subsequent review on appeal was that laid down in the Staff Regulations of the institution.' SUNAT issued unlawful written warnings in the form of cautions to union representatives in the Cajamarca office. SUNAT states that the cautions were issued to Mr Manuel Oswaldo Solano Dvila and Mr Eleodoro Amrico Paredes Fabin in response to a communication which they sent to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Cajamarca containing untrue assertions detrimental to SUNAT s image, as it taxed executives of the institution with mismanagement and moral and ethical decline, and with having been singled out for pay rises and appointed for subjective reasons. The Code of Ethics approved by decision No. 161-2009/SUNAT advocates, among other institutional values, integrity requiring each of us to act consistently with the principles and action of the institution, by maintaining an honest, service-oriented conduct and preserving the good image of a public servant, endeavouring at all times to ensure that our private lives and behaviour are consistent with that image. The assertions made by Mr Solano Dvila and Mr Paredes Fabin were untrue, as the executive bonus by no means constitutes a privilege, but reflects a sound policy that has existed since 2005; accordingly, the abovementioned persons were cautioned to abstain in future from making unfounded assertions affecting SUNAT s image. SUNAT adds that a  caution' by no means constitutes a disciplinary measure, as section 48 of the Staff Regulations provides that the disciplinary penalties applicable to employees are: verbal warning, written warning, suspension of one to 30 days and dismissal or removal from office; the  caution' is thus a call to attention that may be used by managers in the exercise of their managerial prerogative to correct conduct which, in the light of the circumstances, does not constitute misconduct warranting disciplinary action, and is therefore not entered in the personnel file, as provided in the procedure for cautioning employees, a copy of which is attached.' SUNAT issued an unlawful written warning in the form of a caution to the union representative in the Piura office. SUNAT states that the caution was sent to Mr Yovanni Nava Lamia for having used the email system for purposes unrelated to his assigned duties, in violation of the rules on IT security, having confirmed that an email was sent on 23 November 2009 which was unrelated to his assigned duties. In addition, the SUNAT Staff Regulations provide that misuse of email constitutes a violation of section 39(g) of those Regulations; appropriate use of email is a requirement imposed on all SUNAT employees, irrespective of whether they are members of a trade union; the more so since the internal IT rules issued by SUNAT do not reflect an internal policy, but are in line with a national policy aimed at optimizing its use through rational utilization.\n1206.In its communication of 3 May 2011, referring to the positions of SUNAT and SINAUT SUNAT in regard to the alleged violations of freedom of association, the Government states that the State of Peru considers that collective labour rights are recognized in broad terms, mainly in article 28 and the fourth transitional provision of the Political Constitution of Peru, which provide as follows:  Article 28. The State recognizes the rights to form unions, to engage in collective bargaining, and to strike. It ensures their democratic exercise: (1) it guarantees freedom of association; (2) it fosters collective bargaining and promotes the peaceful settlement of labour disputes. Collective agreements are binding within the scope for which they were concluded; (3) it regulates the right to strike so that it will be exercised in keeping with the social interest. It defines its exceptions and limitations.'  Fourth final transitional provision: Rules relating to the rights and freedoms which the Constitution recognizes shall be interpreted in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with other relevant treaties and agreements ratified by Peru.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:50032:0::NO:50032:P50032_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:2912502\n1207.Accordingly, the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion is committed to carrying out the administrative procedures within its remit in order to ensure observance of workers' fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of association. In addition, the Government states that it has requested information from the"", ""judicial proceedings, and, after evaluating and reviewing the documents and information collected, it was found that the matters at issue did not constitute a violation or non-compliance with the Staff Regulations, and therefore the case was closed. The Committee takes note of this information.\n1219.As regards the alleged unlawful caution to the general secretary of SINAUT SUNAT, Ms Paola Aliaga Huatueco, to abide by working hours, the Committee notes that the Government states that SUNAT indicates that: (1) decision No. 067-2006-SUNAT issued rules on working hours, including provisions on staff who are not subject to direct supervision, and section 5 of the Act on working time, working hours and overtime provides that maximum hours of work do not apply to managerial staff, staff who are not subject to direct supervision and those working intermittently on call, or as caretakers or guards; (2) as a result, these workers are not entitled to overtime pay, since they do not have normal maximum hours of work; (3) Ms Aliaga carries out supervisory duties and is included in the category of staff not subject to direct supervision (for example, she may or may not record the time at which she comes to work, depending on her daily work activities); (4) the abovementioned rules do not exempt her from the performance of her assigned duties, and the employer is therefore justified in cautioning employees not subject to direct supervision to perform their assigned duties. In this case, the Committee observes a discrepancy between cautioning her to abide by her working hours (the complainant s version) and cautioning her to perform her duties (SUNAT s version). However, the Committee does not have sufficient information to determine whether anti-union harassment or persecution has occurred. In these circumstances, unless the complainant organization sends new information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.\n1220.As regards the disproportionate evaluation and appraisal of the performance of the abovementioned general secretary of SINAUT SUNAT, the Committee notes that the Government states that SUNAT indicates that: (1) the performance evaluation of the trade union official was carried out in accordance with the rules on annual performance evaluation, based on objective criteria and in the light of evaluation factors and levels of competence for each one; (2) in view of Ms Aliaga Huatueco s disagreement and in accordance with the procedure laid down, an appeals board was set up, which reviewed and evaluated the arguments and evidence presented; (3) the investigation was completed on 25 August 2010 and the appeal was declared receivable in part; and (4) it is thus not correct to assert that the reason for the negative evaluation was her activity as a trade union official, as the evaluation was based on objective criteria and the procedure followed for her evaluation and subsequent review on appeal was that laid down in the Staff Regulations of the institution. In the light of this information, and in the absence of information from the complainant organization on any appeal lodged against the administrative appeal decision, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.\n1221.As regards the allegation that written warnings were issued in the form of cautions to union representatives in the Cajamarca office (Mr Manuel Oswaldo Solano Dvila and Mr Eleodoro Amrico Paredes Fabin) and in the Piura office (Mr Joanna Nava Lamia) and that disciplinary proceedings were initiated against union representatives for alleged misuse of email (Defence Secretary Ms Mara Covarrubias and communication and public relations secretary Mr Jorge Carrillo Vrtice), the Committee notes that the Government states that SUNAT indicates that: (1) as regards the representatives of the Cajamarca office, the warning was issued in response to a communication which the persons concerned sent to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Cajamarca containing untrue assertions detrimental to SUNAT s image, as it taxed executives of the institution with mismanagement and moral and ethical decline, and with having been singled out for pay rises and appointed for subjective reasons; (2) as regards the union representative of the Piura office, the warning was sent for having used the email system for purposes unrelated to his assigned duties; the SUNAT Staff Regulations provide that misuse of email constitutes a violation of the Staff Regulations, and appropriate use of email is a requirement imposed on all SUNAT employees, irrespective of whether they are members of a trade union; and (3) the warnings do not constitute a disciplinary measure. As regards the disciplinary proceedings for alleged misuse of email against union officials Mara Covarrubias and Jorge Carrillo Vrtiz, SUNAT states that it has not authorized its staff or members of the union to use email for non-work-related purposes; specifically, the SUNAT Staff Regulations prohibit the use of email accounts provided by the institution for purposes unrelated to assigned duties, and the prohibitions are strictly mandatory for all staff, unionized or non-unionized. In these circumstances, observing that the Government states that an inspection order will be issued in the matter, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of that inquiry. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that workers' representatives should enjoy such facilities as may be necessary for the proper exercise of their functions, including access to workplaces and the use of email. Recalling that access to employers' facilities should not be exercised to the detriment of the efficient functioning of the enterprise concerned, the Committee suggests that the employer and the workers' organization strive to reach agreement on the modalities for the use of email.\n1222.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not sent its observations in regard to the allegations of the complainant organization objecting to the conduct of the labour administrative authority authorizing SUNAT to express its views on the declaration of a strike on 24 and 25 November 2009. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this regard.\n1223.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee trusts that, should a disagreement arise""]"
