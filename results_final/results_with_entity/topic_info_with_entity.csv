On the other hand, the Committee observes that the enterprise in question alleges that it is the League of Maritime Workers of Paraguay (LOMP) which is violating freedom of association by seeking to impose the selection of workers, exclude the possibility of hiring workers that are not members of its trade unions, and curtail the freedom of association of non-unionized workers. In that regard, the Committee wishes to recall that a distinction should be made between union security clauses allowed by law and those imposed by law, only the latter of which appear to result in a trade union monopoly system contrary to the principles of freedom of association; that problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country; and that both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where they are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee recalls that union security clauses should be agreed freely and observes that the complaints contain no elements to show that the enterprises concerned have agreed to a union security clause; on the contrary, the observations provided show their opposition to any such clause.\n.The Committee also observes that the complaints contain allegations of anti-union discrimination (dismissals and non-recruitment of union members) and refusal to engage in collective bargaining. In this regard, the Committee observes that, although the complainant organizations refer to the subcontractor as the dockworkers' employer, the enterprise that manages the port indicates that the legal relationship was based on service contracts between the subcontractor and the trade unions, which were the employers. The Committee observes that an inspection was conducted to monitor the enterprise s compliance with the labour regulations and, in particular, to investigate the allegations of anti-union dismissals, but that the inspection did not find any violation and found that the workers that claimed a violation of their rights were members of the trade unions of maritime dockworkers and were not employed by the enterprise against which the complaint had been filed. Moreover, the Committee observes that the enterprise indicates that: (i) since the employment relationship was based on service contracts with the trade unions, there was no possibility of collective bargaining on account of the legal obstacle arising from the fact that the workers were employed by the trade union; (ii) no dismissals were carried out, but rather the service contracts with the trade unions were terminated on the grounds of serious non-compliance by the unions (the enterprise includes in this the blockade of the Paraguay River, which reportedly took place after the dismissals); (iii) the enterprise indicated that it was open to hiring the dockworkers who had lost their jobs; and (iv) the enterprise claims that it does not exclude workers who are trade union members from recruitment, but that it is opposed to the imposition of the recruitment of trade union members only. In these circumstances, the Committee does not have the necessary information to conclude that the issues raised involve acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.Furthermore, the Committee welcomes the conciliation efforts made by the Government to address the dispute between the parties, in particular through the tripartite meeting of  February , which, according to the enterprise, yielded the beginnings of an agreement. The Committee invites the Government to continue promoting negotiations between the parties and encourages the parties to continue their dialogue with a view to finding joint solutions in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.\n.The Committee observes that the complaints contain allegations of violation of the right to demonstrate and the criminal prosecution and detention of workers for participating in a strike through an act of protest involving the positioning of canoes on the Paraguay River. According to the complainant organizations, this action did not obstruct the passage of any vessel but resulted in the prosecution of  workers, who remain under house arrest. The Committee observes that the Government, for its part, alleges that: (i) the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, whereupon a judge ordered the end of the blockade at all points on the Paraguay River; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the order, whereupon they were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Office, and article  of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides for imprisonment of up to six years for any person who creates an obstacle that threatens the safety of shipping.\n.The Committee wishes to recall that, according to Article  of Convention No. , although, in exercising the rights provided for in the Convention, workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land, the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention. In that regard, the Committee wishes to refer to the following principles: that workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests; that preventive detention should be limited to very short periods of time intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry; that workers should enjoy prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences; and that the authorities should not resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of or participation in a peaceful strike, since such measures entail serious risks of abuse and constitute a grave threat to freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., paras , ,  and ].\n.Noting that the Government does not deny that the strike was peaceful or that  workers are still being prosecuted and under house arrest, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings brought against the workers who participated in the protest actions on the Paraguay River and at land access points to the Caacupe-m port, trusting that the proceedings will be settled as soon as possible and bearing in mind the aforementioned principles of freedom of association. The Committee also invites the authorities to consider lifting the preventive detention measures.\n.The Committee notes with concern the allegations of restriction of the trade unions' right to represent their members, and of the consequences that could arise from the refusal of representation to the trade unions (according to the complainant organizations, failure to win claims for substantial sums of money affecting a large number of workers). The Committee observes that the complainants refer to three rulings by the Supreme Court of Justice, denying the unions the possibility of representation on the grounds that no express mandate had been given by the trade union s assembly (the complainants claim, however, that in at least two of the three cases they had submitted the assembly minutes conferring an express mandate). The Committee also observes that, although the Government does not go into the substance of the issue and merely recognizes the existence of the rulings in question, the Supreme Court of Justice itself, while considering an express mandate to be legally necessary, found in two of the rulings that  the ensuing deregulation may be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union'  In this regard, the Committee considers that neither the legislation nor the application thereof should limit the right of employers' and workers' organizations to represent their members, including in cases of individual labour complaints. The Committee invites the Government to examine, in consultation with the social partners, the adequacy of the legislation and of the application thereof in order to ensure that employers' and workers' organizations are able"", ""According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.\n.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.\n.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.\n.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.\n.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.\n.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.\n.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.\n.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).\n.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).\n.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .\n.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.\n.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.\n.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.\n.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May "", ""considers it essential that there will be legislation to ensure that in the future certain  excesses' of  abuses' are avoided, but questions whether the amendments have been in accordance with normal and rational practice, i.e. through collective bargaining, and that resort was made instead to the subjective and arbitrary government authority through public officials. The Committee observes that the complainant organization emphasizes that nowhere in Constituent Resolution No.  does it state that the revising commission (of collective agreements) is composed solely of officials of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. That was defined, emphasizes FETRAPEC, by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in Ministerial Order No. , which grants discretionary powers to that commission and excludes any administrative or judicial appeal; the  contributions' of workers' organizations and the employer, according to that order, will be appraised by the commission applying the principle of  healthy criticism' \n.To the extent that this case involves legal instruments (Constituent Resolutions, regulations, ministerial orders) which affect conditions of work, the Committee wishes to emphasize the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee highlights that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise [see Digest, op. cit., fifth edition, , para. ]. In the present case, nothing indicates either the Government s statements or the content of the legal texts to which the complainants object, that in-depth consultations were held in advance and allowing sufficient time with the workers' organizations concerned (which deplore the unilateral nature of the legal instruments in question) and for that reason, the Committee requests the Government in future to take into account the aforementioned principles in order, as far as possible, to reach shared solutions.\n.As regards the provisions in the Constituent Resolutions which set a cap on remuneration in the public sector (No. ), compensation for unfair dismissal and other causes of termination of the employment relation (No.  and No. ) or prohibit supplementary private pension schemes which involve contributions of State resources (Executive Decree No.  of  October , which provides that State resources shall not be contributed to funds of a private nature), the Committee does not doubt the expressed will of the Government to look after the general interest, ensure equality, avoid unreasonable excesses in collective agreements and ensure financial and budgetary balance, but wishes to emphasize that these are permanent and unalterable limitations on the right of collective bargaining of workers' organizations incompatible with Convention No. , which provides for free and voluntary bargaining of conditions of work and if the Government wishes to pursue a policy which seeks those objectives which, moreover, are legitimate, it can do so in the framework of collective bargaining without resorting to impositions which limit the content of bargaining by the parties to that bargaining. The Committee recalls that limitations on the free determination of wages in collective bargaining are only acceptable in exceptional circumstances. In this respect, the Committee has indicated that  If, as part of its stabilization policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee has taken the view that the parties involved in collective bargaining can improve the legal provisions on pensions [see rd report, Case No. , para. ].\n.Furthermore, the Committee recalls the principle that repeated recourse to legislative restrictions on collective bargaining can only, in the long term, prejudice and destabilize the labour relations climate if the legislator frequently intervenes to suspend or terminate the exercise of rights recognized for unions and their members. Moreover, this may have a detrimental effect on workers' interests in unionization, since members and potential members could consider useless joining an organization, the main objective of which is to represent its members in collective bargaining, if the results of such bargaining are constantly cancelled by law [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and trade unions should have the right, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to seek to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent. The public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Any such interference would appear to infringe the principle that workers' and employers' organizations should have the right to organize their activities and to formulate their programmes [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.The Committee has considered that measures taken unilaterally by the authorities to restrict the scope of negotiable issues are often incompatible with Convention No. ; tripartite discussions for the preparation, on a voluntary basis, of guidelines for collective bargaining are a particularly appropriate method of resolving these difficulties [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.In particular, the Committee also emphasizes the principle that the reservation of budgetary powers to the legislative authority should not have the effect of preventing compliance with collective agreements entered into by, or on behalf of, that authority [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.The Committee requests the Government to restore the right of collective bargaining on conditions of work and living standards of workers and to inform it accordingly.\n.With respect to the alleged declaration of absolute nullity or the imposition of the revision of clauses of collective agreements by administrative means (in those cases where the administrative authority considers that the clauses of such agreements contain excesses and unreasonable privileges which conflict with the general interest in the numerous cases listed indicatively in Constituent Resolution No.  and its regulations for application), the Committee observes that the administrative procedure is regulated by Ministerial Order No.  and Order No. A, both of the Ministry of Labour. The Committee emphasizes that control of clauses of public sector agreements for possible abuse should not be up to the administrative authority, since it cannot be both judge and party, but a matter for the judicial authority, and then only in extremely serious cases, and not for just any significant benefit which has been agreed. The Committee therefore requests the Government that control of allegedly abusive clauses of collective agreements should only be carried out through the courts, so as to ensure impartiality, the right of defence and due process. The Committee observes that in the present case, the decisions of the administrative authorities are not subject to any appeal whatsoever, whether administrative or judicial and considers that the current regulations, especially the instruments of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, which allow it unilaterally to declare void or reduce a wide range of clauses of collective agreements, is a serious violation of the principle of free and voluntary bargaining. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to annul those ministerial texts and their effects and to indicate whether Constituent Resolution No.  is compatible with exclusively judicial control (not administrative) of the possible abusive character of certain clauses of collective agreements in the public sector. The Committee requests the authorities that, if it is wished to amend the result of collective bargaining, it should wait until the expiry of the collective agreements and the respective employers should renegotiate their content with the trade union organizations.\n.More specifically, with respect to the revision of the clauses of the collective agreements of the Petroecuador company and its subsidiaries and the health sector, by decision of the commission on the revisions of collective agreements in the public sector, the Committee notes the excesses of some of the clauses highlighted by the Government, and that the complainant organization FETRAPEC implicitly recognizes some excesses in certain clauses. The Committee considers that, in conformity with the principles and considerations expressed in the foregoing paragraphs, the revisions made by the Ministry of Labour and Employment should be cancelled. The Committee understands that the FETRAPEC organizations would be disposed to engage in renegotiation with their employers and that this would probably also be the case in the health sector, where, for example, the clause on working hours and days, and other clauses, were declared void.\n.The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that these collective agreements are renegotiated if the trade union organizations confirm the wish to do so.\n.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken to give effect to its recommendations and, noting the request of the complainant organizations, invites the Government to""]"

The Committee expresses the hope that the judicial inquiries under way and those that are to be initiated will put an end to the situation of impunity which has existed up until now.(e) The Committee also requests the Government to send observations on the allegations of the ICFTU ( June ) and of the CLAT ( October ) concerning the assassination of Luis Armando Prez, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Customs Workers, the attempted assassination of Sixto Prez Coche, the Financial Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the La Patria Farm and the following of the trade union leader Jos Antonio Garca by an armed individual. Furthermore, the Committee repeats its request for information on developments in the inquiries relating to the death of the trade unionist Juan Tarax, Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar, Camilo Ajqui, to the arrests of the trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Rolando Pastor and Francisco Pastor, and to the abduction of Walter Njera Molina, who was released.(f) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide more details of the alleged death of Edwin Giovanni Hidalgo (according to the Government he was neither a worker nor a trade union leader at the National Electrification Institute, which is why it needs additional information to confirm his death), and on other, too general allegations indicated in the annex to this report.(g) The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the dismissals and other acts of anti-union discrimination that occurred at the International Textile Corporation S.A., El Salto farm, La Mariposa bottling enterprise and the Municipality of Coban, and that it has not sent information on developments in the legal proceedings concerning the dismissal of several trade union leaders of the Workers' Union of the San Juan de Dios Hospital. The Committee requests the Government to send information in this connection.(h) The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations of anti-union dismissals, violations of the right to collective bargaining and acts of reprisal against unionized workers at the Las Delicias farm.(i) Lastly, the Committee again appeals to the Government to provide information on the inquiry which the Office of the Attorney-General was asked to carry out into the alleged surveillance of the IUF premises by persons unknown on  August .\n.At its meeting of June , the Committee made the following recommendations on the allegations pending (see th Report, para. ):- the Committee recalls the commitment made by the Attorney-General of the Republic to open investigations on all the cases presented to the Committee and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect;- regretting that it has not received all the information requested from the Government concerning the deaths and other alleged acts of violence, the Committee urges it to reply as a matter of urgency to the list of allegations contained in Annex I and to take the necessary measures to guarantee the safety of trade unionists under threat of death and to determine the whereabouts of those who have disappeared;(the contents of Annex I are reproduced below):Assassinations of trade unionists- Tyron Francisco Segastume, Trade Union of Workers of the Coca-Cola bottling enterprise (STETCSA), in February ;- Nstor Ren Osorio Sandoval, Trade Union of Electricity Workers (STINDE), in March ;- Juan Tarax, trade union activist in the Sugar Enterprise of El Pilar (Retalhuen), in April ;- Jos Mara Ixcuyat, peasant activist, in May ;- Petronila Hernndez Vasilio, secretary responsible for organization of the Trade Union of Independent Agricultural Workers of La Reformita (Moyuta, Jutiapa), in July ;- Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar, member of the special strike committee of the Trade Union of Workers of the Social Security Institute (STIGGS), in April ;- Camilo Ajqui Gimon, member of the Council of Ethnic Communities;- Rujunel Junam (CERJ), on  April ;- Julio Csar Prez (rural worker), on  July ;

The Government has made great efforts to increase funds and during the next few weeks, there will be a considerable outlay to strengthen the human and financial sources of the judiciary. Public order judges were created, as well as a Tribunal under this same jurisdiction. Since , this Government, given the need to adopt measures to protect the life, personal integrity and exercise of constitutional and political rights of Colombian citizens, has taken steps to strengthen the judiciary; it was for this reason that it issued Decree No.  of  (a copy is provided), with a view to establishing public order judges ""... to examine conduct punishable under the Penal Code, when this is intended to persecute or intimidate persons throughout the national territory, on account of their beliefs or political opinions, whether partisans or not"". Later, the Government introduced further measures aimed at strengthening Higher Judicial District Courts and public order magistrates to facilitate the judgement of those crimes that particularly undermine public law and order. For instance, it issued Decree No.  of  which provided for the setting up of Public Order Courts within the Higher Judicial District Courts. Decree No.  of  March  set up a special jurisdiction for the maintenance of law and order; this was supplemented by Decree No.  of  November  and Decrees Nos.  and  of  (copies are also provided). Decree No.  of  June , supplements Legislative Decree No.  of  and deals with penalties for new types of criminal action; this is considered necessary in order to combat death squadrons, gangs of hired assassins, self-defence or private justice groups. In application of these standards, many investigations are being carried out concerning members of these groups who are operating outside the law. To date, mass murders are on the decline. Although this is not enough, these are positive steps by the Government in its action to come to grips with and overcome the impunity enjoyed by the authors of these reprehensible acts.\n.The Government goes on to state that during the past few days, steps have been taken to appoint magistrates to assist regular judges at the Public Order Tribunal, as well as accountants for these judges. The Government will take this decision under a Decree of state of seige. In accordance with the above-mentioned Decree, each judge will be granted an assistant, as well as accountants that can participate in summary investigations, because this institution is overloaded trying to implement the special decrees issued to put an end to drug trafficking. Under Decree No.  of  August , the Security Fund of the Judiciary was set up (a copy is provided) with a view to financing the safety and protection of judges in the Republic in view of the persistent attacks on members of the judiciary by armed groups and organisations connected with drug trafficking. At present, various methods are being put into practice with this objective of protecting judges, such as special training for their bodyguards and the purchase of equipment for their physical protection. The Government is also taking steps to try and commit other countries to participate in this attempt to strengthen and protect magistrates.\n.Referring to the allegations of acts of violence against trade unionists and trade union headquarters, the Government submits official statistical data. The wave of violence that has affected a large number of trade unionists has been concentrated in the areas of Urab (Antioquia), Barrancabermeja and its vicinity (Santander) and the municipality of San Alberto (Cesar), because a number of the major recognised trade unions are found in these areas; these include the Agricultural Workers\' Trade Union of Urab (Antioquia), the Workers\' Trade Union (USO) in Barrancabermeja (Santander) and the Trade Union of Workers in the Palm Industry (INDUPALMA) in San Alberto (Cesar). The breakdown of the number of victims amongst trade unionists in the areas mentioned above is from January  onwards, as follows: in the Urab area,  murders; in Barrancabermeja,  murders; in San Alberto,  murders.\n.Furthermore, there have been  murders in the rest of the country, making a total of  murders of trade union officials and trade union members during the past three years. During the same period, there have been  attacks with dynamite perpetrated against trade union headquarters. Differences in statistics are due to criteria of assessment and analysis as to what are considered criminal offences and political violence resulting from extreme left-wing and right-wing terrorism; many murders of trade unionists have been criminal offences. It should, however, be pointed out that a high percentage of these cases (both murders and attacks) occurred during ; in  figures dropped by approximately  per cent and during , by  per cent. This indicates a considerable decline in the number of murders, a result of the measures adopted by the Government to protect the life and integrity of trade unionists. Once again, the Government reiterates that its attitude is directed not only to respect for but defence of the rights of workers. It has been and still is a basic priority for the Government to protect the life and integrity not only of trade unionists but of all individuals throughout the country.\n.Concerning the strike of  October , the Government states that the situation of law and order in Colombia is problematic and conditions since October  have been particularly serious. The Government states that it was not opposed to a workers\' strike in October , conducted by workers to promote the interest of workers. The same trade unionists themselves claimed that the strike was a pretext to destabilise the country\'s democratic institutions. The measures that the Government was forced to take to guarantee the stability of the democratic institutions and to maintain public peace were taken in accordance with the provisions of the national Constitution, stipulating that exceptional measures may be taken in emergency situations or a state of seige. They were only taken to deal with attempts to undermine the country\'s democratic stability and, once the danger was over, the national Government lifted these measures. In view of the conditions of law and order prevailing and the serious terrorist acts that were being committed and planned, the Government felt that the only way to deal with the public emergency and preserve the higher values of a democratic society was to suspend temporarily a number of guarantees.\n.The Government issued Decree No.  of , concerning the arrest of persons who had suppported the strike, and Decree No.  of , concerning the suspension of the legal personality of trade union organisations. The Decrees were submitted to the control of the Supreme Court of Justice which, having heard the favourable opinion of the Attorney-General of the Nation - an official who fulfils the role of the Swedish ""ombudsman"", the French ""mediateur"" or North American ""General Attorney"" in Colombia - found them in accordance with the national Constitution. The Government points out that decrees of this nature are in conformity with those provided for in the American Convention on Human Rights, the Covenant of San Jos of  November , the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations of  December  and the International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations.\n.Acting within the extraordinary powers conferred upon it by the political Constitution, the Government temporarily suspended, on the basis of Decree No.  of , the legal personality of trade union organisations in sectors where there had been the greatest upheaval. A number of trade unions appealed through administrative channels, and the State Council provisionally suspended the penalties - not because the Government had overstepped its rights by applying them, but because they had been pronounced after the Government had voluntarily repealed the Decree upon which these measures were based. It is necessary to point out that once the internal unrest had quietened down, the Government repealed the Decrees it had taken to deal with the situation.

This was a decision that clearly demonstrates the democratic structure of the Colombian Government. Exceptional measures were only taken to cope', 'members of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and social organizations. The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that none of the different forms of violence that Colombia is suffering may be imputed to the State as its policy or as the conduct of its responsible organs and agents. Thus, if occasionally, by way of an exception, persons in state service should have become involved in conduct in violation of human rights, deviating from their duties and going against the permanent instructions of those responsible for guiding the actions of public servants, their crime has invariably met with strong censure from society and an inexorable response from the State in terms of punishment. The Government indicates that according to the information provided by the Office of the High Counsellor for Human Rights that the majority of human rights violations come from self-defence groups followed by members of the paramilitary forces and subversives. The Committee takes note of the intimidatory pamphlets reproduced in the Government\'s reply in which the self-defence forces threaten trade union activists and leaders. It also takes note of the data furnished by the High Commissioner for Peace on the convictions, detentions and trials against the members of these self-defence forces. Finally, the Committee takes notes of the Government\'s statement that the armed conflict has killed over , people in the past decade of whom some  were involved in trade unions and some  were trade union officials and that these figures are very different from the statistics provided by the complainants.\n.While taking note of the important difficulties encountered by the Government and its efforts in accelerating the peace process and eliminating violence, the Committee deplores the fact that, since the previous examination of the case in March , more acts of violence have been committed against trade union officials and members ( murders, three attempted murders, disappearances and death threats) and more acts of anti-union discrimination. Additionally, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that none of the investigations under way has identified the perpetrators, which confirms the existence in Colombia of a climate of impunity favouring further acts of violence and the fact that holding trade union office involves risk to the safety of the individuals involved particularly in regions where the conflict is more acute. The Committee also regrets to note that the Government has only sent observations on part of the allegations, failing to reply to the vast majority of the prior requests for information.\n.The Committee reiterates that ""the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events"" and that ""the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights""(see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ).\n.In these circumstances, noting that the situation remains alarming, the Committee urges the Government to take immediate measures to determine where responsibilities lie, try and punish the guilty parties, and prevent the repetition of acts of violence and anti-union acts against union leaders and unionists.Acts of violence concerning which the Committee requested at its March  meeting to be kept informed of the development of investigations\n.Concerning the allegations regarding which the Government had reported at the March  meeting or earlier that investigations and legal proceedings were under way, the Committee regrets to note that the Government has not sent any new information on the development of proceedings concerning the individuals mentioned in the following two paragraphs and urges the Government to provide information in that respect without delay.Murders\n.() Antonio Moreno Asprilla ( August ); () Manuel Ballesta ( August ; () Francisco Mosquera Crdoba (February ); () Carlos Arroyo de Arco (February ); () Francisco Antonio Usuga ( March ); () Pedro Luis Bermdez Jaramillo ( June ); () Armando Umanes Petro ( May ); () William Gustavo Jaimes Torres ( August ); () Jaime Eliacer Ojeda; () Alfonso Noguera Cano; () Alvaro Hoyos Pabn ( December ); () Nstor Eduardo Galndez Rodrguez ( March ); () Erieleth Barn Daza ( May ); () Jhon Fredy Arboleda Aguirre; () William Alonso Surez Gil; () Eladio de Jess Chaverra Rodrguez; () Luis Carlos Muoz ( March ); () Nazareno de Jess Rivera Garca ( March ); () Hctor Gmez ( March ); () Gilberto Casas Arboleda; () Norberto Casas Arboleda; () Alcides de Jess Palacios Casas ( February ); () Argiro de Jess Betancur Espinosa ( February ); () Jos Isidoro Leyton ( March ); () Eduardo Enrique Ramos Montiel ( July ); () Libardo Cullar Navia ( July ); () Wenceslao Varela Torrecilla ( July ); () Abraham Figueroa Bolaos ( July ); () Edgar Camacho Bolaos ( July ); () Flix Avils Arroyo ( December ); () Juan Camacho Herrera ( April ); () Luis Orlando Camao Galvis ( July ); () Hernando Cuadros Mendoza (); () Freddy Francisco Fuentes Paternina ( July ); () Vctor Julio Garzn ( March ); () Isidro Segundo Gil Gil ( December ); () Jos Silvio Gmez ( April ); () Enoc Mendoza Riasco ( April ); () Luis Orlando Quiceno Lpez ( July ); () Arnold Enrique Snchez Maza ( July ); () Camilo Surez Ariza ( July ); () Mauricio Tapias Llerena ( July ); () Atilio Jos Vsquez (July ); () Odulfo Zambrano Lpez ( October ); () Alvaro Jos Taborda Alvarez ( January ) (mentioned in the allegations as having disappeared); () Elkin Clavijo ( November ); () Alfonso Nio ( November ); () Luis Emilio Puerta Orrego ( November ); () Fabio Humberto Burbano Crdoba ( January ); () Osfanol Torres Crdenas ( January ); () Fernando Triana ( January ), () Francisco Hurtado Cabezas ( February ), () Misael Daz Ursola ( May ); () Sabas Domingo Socadegui Paredes ( June ); () Jess Arley Escobar Posada ( July ); () Jos Ral Giraldo Hernndez ( November ); () Bernardo Orrego Orrego; and () Jos Eduardo Umaa Mendoza ( April ).Disappearances\n.() Rodrigo Rodriguez Sierra ( February ); () Ramn Osorio Beltrn ( April ); () Alexander Cardona ( July ); and () Mario Jimnez ( July ).Acts of violence outstanding at the March  meeting of the Committee concerning which the Government sent observations\n.Concerning the allegations which remained outstanding at the examination of this case in March , the Committee notes that the Government reports that it has opened judicial investigations into the following cases: murders: Jos Vicente Rincn (murdered on  January  in Barrancabermeja); Jorge Boada Palencia (murdered on  April ); Jorge Duarte Chvez (murdered in Barrancabermeja on  May ); Carlos Rodrguez Mrquez (murdered on  May ); Arcngel Rubio Ramrez Giraldo; Orfa Ligia Meja (murdered on  October ); Macario Herrera Villota; Vctor Eloy Mieles Ospino and Rosa Ramrez; attempted murders: Virgilio Ochoa Prez; Eugeniano Snchez; Benito Rueda Villamizar. The Committee expresses its grave concern and repudiates these acts and requests the Government to keep it informed as a matter of urgency on the results of the investigations and prosecutions under way.\n.Concerning the allegations of the attempted murders of the trade union leaders Tarcisio Mora, Jess Antonio Gonzlez Luna and Jos Domingo Tovar Arrieta, the Committee notes that the Government refutes the allegations of these incidents and denies, in the three cases, that such attacks took place, presenting police reports which support its position.Recent acts of violence concerning which the Government is awaiting information\n.As concerns the alleged murders of trade union leaders and members regarding which the Government reports that it is awaiting specific information from the Office of the Procurator-General (Oscar Artunduaga Nuez, Jess Orlando Arvalo, Moiss Canedo Estrada, Gladys Pulido Monroy, Oscar David Calandn Gonzales, Oswaldo Rojas, Julio Alfonso Poveda, Pedro Alejandrino Melchor Tapasco and Manuel Avila Ruiz), the Committee notes that concerning Jess Orlando Arvalo, Julio Alfonso Poveda, Vctor Eloy Mieles Ospino and Rosa Ramrez, the Government discounts any connection between the murders and the trade union activities of the deceased. In order to be able to pronounce itself in this regard, the Committee urges the Government without delay to ensure that investigations have been opened and to keep it informed in this respect.Acts of violence into which the investigations have been adjourned\n.Concerning the eight murder cases where the investigations have been adjourned by the competent Procurator\'s Office (Ernesto Emilio Fernndez Pezter, murdered on  November ; Libardo Antonio Acevedo, murdered on  July ; Magaly Pearanda, murdered on  July ; David Quintero Uribe, murdered on  August ; Aurelio Arbelez, murdered on  March ; Jos Guillermo Asprilla Torres, murdered on  July ; Carlos Arturo Moreno Lpez, murdered']"

The Committee takes note of this information with interest.\n.Concerning the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the SEMTIAC on  May , the Committee had urged the Government to implement the administrative resolutions and to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that the dismissed union official was reinstated in his post, with payment of outstanding wages and other benefits. The Committee notes the Government s statement that the request submitted by the union official on  May  is currently before the First District Labour Court of Managua, where it is awaiting the Court s ruling, and that the Government will in due course inform the Committee of the decision taken by the Court. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision handed down in this regard.\n.With respect to the alleged persecution and harassment in order to later proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA DGTT MTI, the Committee had requested the Government to keep it informed of any legal appeal that the union official, Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, might have presented against the resolution of the General Labour Inspectorate. The Committee notes the Government s statement that, in a decision rendered on  January , the Civil Chamber No.  of the Court of Appeals of the constituency of Managua declared that his appeal for legal protection was irreceivable and dismissed the case. In the light of this information and the fact that the complainant organization has not commented on the dismissal of the case, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations any further.\n.As regards the alleged request to cancel the contract of employment of union official Javier Ruiz lvarez, the Committee had requested the Government to provide information on the specific reasons behind that request and to keep it informed of the final outcome of the proceedings before the Departmental Labour Inspectorate. The Committee notes the Government s statement that Mr Ruiz lvarez withdrew the appeal that he had lodged with the courts. The Committee takes note with interest that he is currently working at the MTI in the General Directorate of Water Transport.\n.Relating to the alleged dismissal without respect for trade union immunity or legal process of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA DGTT MTI on  April , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the MTI had informed it that Mr Centeno s contract, which was for a position of trust, had been terminated in accordance with article  of the Civil Service and Administrative Career Act. While the Committee appreciates that workers in positions of trust can be freely appointed and removed, it observes that the Government does not deny that Mr Centeno held a trade union post and recalls the following:  One of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee calls upon the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for terminating the contract of union official Mr Centeno and, in the event it is found that it was due to his legitimate trade union activities, to endeavour to have him reinstated.\n.With regard to the alleged transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, member of the Executive Committee of SEMTIAC, the Committee notes the Government s statement that Mr Meja Lpez had lodged an appeal for legal protection against alleged threats of dismissal with Civil Chamber No.  of the Court of Appeals of the constituency of Managua but that since he did not appear in court to ratify his appeal, it was decided to treat the matter as if the appeal had not been lodged. The Committee observes that the Government does not deny that union official Mr Meja Lpez was transferred, and calls on it to take the necessary measures to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for his transfer and, in the event it is found that the transfer was due to his exercise of trade union activities, to ensure that he is transferred back to his previous post.\n.Concerning the alleged workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, secretary for labour affairs of the SEMTIAC, who is said to have been dismissed on  May  and reinstated the same day and to be again at risk of dismissal, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the union official had lodged an appeal for legal protection with the judicial authorities and that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, in ruling on the matter, found that, far from receiving threats of dismissal, the complainant had been encouraged by the institution to take part in trade union events abroad and had eventually dismissed the appeal. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this allegation any further.\n.With respect to the alleged anti-union dismissals of Ms Perla Marina Corea Zamora, Secretary-General of the Independent Workers Trade Union of the MTI, Ms Yerigel Ziga Izaguirre, the same union s finance secretary, Ms Lila Carolina Alvarado Muoz, first spokesperson of the watchdog unit of the SEMTIAC, Mr Freddy Antonio Velsquez Luna, Secretary-General of the SITRAMTI and Secretary-General of FEDETRASEP, Mr Jorge Boanerges Cruz Berros, organization and information secretary of SITRAMTI and spokesperson for the FEDETRASEP, Mr Byron Antonio Tercero Ramos, organization, records and agreements secretary of SINTESESIP MTI and Mr Francisco Zamora Vivas, finance secretary of the SITRAMTI, the Committee notes the Government s statement that they had lodged appeals which were awaiting the decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The Committee expects that the judicial authority will shortly hand down its decision and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.\n.Finally, as regards the allegation that the current administration of the MTI is infringing article  of the collective agreement in force concerning the resources that trade unions need to carry out their activities (computer with access to Internet, printer, office supplies, use of a vehicle, etc.) and that these facilities are made available only to a trade union that follows the party line, the Committee recalls that  agreements should be binding on the parties' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and notes that both the authorities and the employers must avoid any form of discrimination among trade union organizations that have signed the same collective agreement. That being so, the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the matter and, should it find the allegation to be true, to take steps to bring the parties together and ensure full compliance with the clauses of the collective agreement cited by the complainant organization.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of SEMTIAC, and while noting the Government s statement that the request before the First District Labour Court of Managua is awaiting the Court s ruling, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision that is handed down.(b) Concerning to the alleged dismissal without respect for trade union immunity or legal process of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA DGTT MTI on  April , the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for terminating his contract and, in the event it is found that the dismissal as due to his legitimate trade union activities, to endeavour to have him reinstated.(c) With respect to the alleged transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, member of the Executive Committee of the SEMTIAC, the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for his transfer and, in the event it is found that the transfer was due to his exercise of trade union activities, to take steps to have him transferred back to his previous post.(d) As regards the alleged anti-union dismissal of Ms Perla Marina Corea Zamora, Secretary-General of the Independent Workers Trade Union"", 'the CGTG s statement to the effect that, in December , the Trade Union of Workers of the Municipality of Pueblo Nuevo Vias was established and that from that time onwards, the municipal authorities began adopting measures against all the workers and especially against trade union officers. For example, despite the conclusion of a collective agreement which included a provision guaranteeing stability of employment, the mayor dismissed ten workers including the union s general secretary and two members of the consultative council. An application was made to the courts to order reinstatement of the dismissed workers, but it was only possible to obtain an order to reinstate the general secretary and the two members of the consultative council. An appeal was filed and is still pending. The CGTG also alleges that when the executive minister visited the municipality in order to ensure that the reinstatement order was carried out, the mayor agreed only to reinstate the general secretary, who was demoted the following day. A complaint was then made to the court, and the case is still pending. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, on  February  a group of workers in the municipality complained to the Labour Inspectorate that they had been dismissed, and that some of the workers concerned have received appropriate compensation but that the case of the others is still pending. The Government states in this regard that on  March  a group of dismissed workers asked the Labour Inspectorate to intervene in order to obtain their reinstatement. The employer offered appropriate compensation but this was rejected by the workers. The Committee notes that the Government has not denied the allegations concerning the dismissal of the general secretary of the union and two members of the consultative council, and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the order to reinstate these three union officers is carried out and that they are actually reinstated in their posts without loss of wages, and to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any administrative or judicial rulings concerning the remaining allegations. It also requests the CGTG to communicate the names of the workers concerned.Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation\n.The Committee notes that, with regard to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation, UNSITRAGUA alleges that in the last two years, there have been illegal dismissals, disciplinary proceedings, dismissals without just cause in connection with reorganization, and transfers intended to force workers belonging to the trade union representing employees of the Office to resign. The dismissed workers include the following: Alcira Noem Salguero Noguera, Rafael Fransisco Urrutia, Myrian Estela Godoy Bonilla de Rodrguez, Ramn Estuardo Monzn Sagui, Andrs Muoz Quevedo, Juan Ignacio Miguel Ortiga Aparicio and Sara Cajas. According to UNSITRAGUA, these dismissals violate the principles of legality and the administrative disciplinary procedures established under the collective agreement. Those dismissed in connection with reorganization are as follows: Eliseo Ismael Rivera Castro, Laura Lili Alvarez Muralles de Pineda, Yuri Zumeta, Robinson Arnoldo Chevez Martnez, Jos Antonio Lpez Mendoza, Livi Deisse Ramrez Ramrez, Hctor Humberto Barrios Mazariegos, Dense Juan Fransisco Alonzo Mazariegos, and Andrs Muoz Quevedo. These dismissals violated article  of the collective agreement, which expressly prohibits dismissal in connection with reorganization and, furthermore, the Attorney-General s Office refused to submit the decision to the bipartite Joint Panel for review, as required by the collective agreement. The following workers were transferred: Myrian Estela de Rodrguez, Roberto de Lon, Anabella Ortiz Mijangos, Julia Leticia Martnez Chavarra, Mirna Irecema Rodrguez Rivera, Mara del Rosario Prez y Prez, Olga Marina Chang Lpez, Adelso Pojoy Silva, Annecke Jannette Vsquez Ramrez, Enma Araceli Soto Romero, Silvia Hortensia Castillo Avila and Alcira Noem Salguero Noguera. Workers were not informed or consulted in advance with regard to these transfers, and, in contravention of article  of the collective agreement, the Office of the Attorney-General refused in every case to submit the decision to the Joint Panel for review, as required by the collective agreement. The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations on these allegations, and requests it to send its comments without delay, with details of the administrative or judicial rulings handed down on this matter.\n.The Committee notes that, in response to its recommendation in which it requested further information on the dismissal of Flix Alexander Gonzles of the Office of the Attorney-General, UNSITRAGUA states that the Office used a problem unconnected with work as a pretext for the dismissal, accusing the worker of something not regarded as a reason for dismissal and thus violating the principle of legality. The Government states that the Second Chamber of the Labour and Social Security Appeals Court rejected the worker s application for reinstatement and, in view of the fact that the worker did not appeal, declared the case closed. The Committee once again requests the Government to transmit a copy of the ruling given by the Second Chamber in this case.National Hospital for Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation\n.The Committee notes the Government s information regarding the delay in dealing with the application for reinstatement of Luis Rolando Velsquez at the National Hospital for Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, to the effect that the case was examined by the Third Chamber of the Labour and Social Security Appeals Court under file No. - and that, according to the file, the ruling was implemented on  October . The Committee takes note of this information.Port enterprise Santo Toms de Castilla\n.As regards the alleged dismissal by the port enterprise Santo Toms de Castilla of the entire provisional executive committee of the Union of Dockers, Loaders, Unloaders and Other Workers of the port enterprise Santo Toms de Castilla, the Committee notes the allegation by UNSITRAGUA that although the dismissed workers were reinstated on  February , they have since then been subjected to a series of acts of anti-union discrimination including the following: (a) failure to provide the safety equipment required for their work; (b) permanent assignment to the most exhausting and arduous duties; (c) classification on wage slips as being employed for specified tasks only, despite the fact that their contracts are without limit of time; and (d) payment of lower wages than other workers at the enterprise. The Committee notes that the Government confines itself to stating that that the Labour and Social Security Court of Izabal department ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, and does not reply to the new allegations sent by UNSITRAGUA. The Committee requests the Government to send its comments in this regard without delay.Secretariat of Public Works of the First Ladyof the Republic of Guatemala\n.With regard to the allegation by UNSITRAGUA, that on  March  the female workers of the Secretariat of Public Works of the First Lady of the Republic of Guatemala presented a set of claims to the Labour Inspectorate with a view to negotiating a number of improvements in working conditions, but that the inspectorate deliberately delayed forwarding the list to the secretariat (more than  days passed between presentation of the claims and notification of the employer) and thereby made it possible to dismiss about  workers (because, under the terms of the Act respecting union membership and strike action for state employees and its amendments, workers may seek judicial protection by declaring a collective dispute only after the direct means of redress have been exhausted after a period of  days from the presentation of the claims to the employer), the Committee notes the Government s information to the effect that: (a) on the date in question, notification was received of the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee of Workers of the Secretariat of Public Works of the First Lady of the Republic, together with a set of claims for forwarding to the secretariat; (b) the Labour Inspectorate dealt with this in the normal way, and asked the Department of Labour Registration whether there was already a legally constituted trade union; it was confirmed that this was the case; (c) on  March , the inspectorate issued Decision No. - ordering that the Trade Union of the Secretariat of Public Works of the First Lady of the Republic be informed of the content of the notice of establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee and the claims; the union did not reply after three days, and the Labour Inspectorate therefore deemed the notice and the claims to have been duly received and closed the case. The Committee notes the Government s categorical denial that the normal process of examining the case was a delaying tactic, and states that the Labour Inspectorate is obliged to ascertain whether there is already a legally constituted trade union so that it can inform the union of the establishment of an ad hoc committee and of any claims, given that in practice some ad hoc committees are supported by employers with a view to concluding collective agreements that sideline existing unions. The Committee takes note of this information.\n.As', ""subsequently to force her to sign a number of papers without her knowing the contents. In its communication of  May , UNSITRAGUA alleges that on  May , also in the Office, Edna Violeta Daz Reyes was also dismissed without just cause. She had been the union s inter-union relations secretary. The organization maintains that this violated trade union immunity and was an attempt to make her liable for a demonstration carried out by a group of skilled workers who were owed four months' wages.\n.In its communication of  May , UNSITRAGUA states with regard to its previous allegation concerning the dismissal by the port enterprise Santo Toms de Castilla of the entire provisional executive committee of the Union of Dockers, Loaders, Unloaders and Other Workers of the port enterprise Santo Toms de Castilla, that the workers were reinstated in their posts on  February . The organization alleges, however, that since their reinstatement, the workers have been the target of a range of anti-union discriminatory measures, including the following: (a) they have been denied the safety equipment needed for their work, despite the fact that they had requested it several times and lodged a complaint with the Izabal department Labour Inspectorate; (b) they were constantly assigned to the most exhausting and arduous tasks involving constant exposure to the sun; (c) although they had without limit of time contracts, they were classified according to their pay slips as workers hired for specified tasks only; and (d) they are paid less than the other workers at the enterprise.\n.In its communication of  July , UNSITRAGUA alleges that over the last two years, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation has initiated a number of measures intended to weaken and break up the trade union of workers of the Office of the Attorney-General. These included illegal dismissals, disciplinary proceedings, unjustified dismissals in connection with reorganization, and transfers of workers to force them to leave. The following trade union members were among the workers dismissed: Alcira Noem Salguero Noguera, Rafael Fransisco Urrutia, Myrian Estela Godoy Bonilla de Rodrguez, Ramn Estuardo Monzn Sagui, Andrs Muoz Quevedo, Juan Ignacio Miguel Ortiga Aparicio and Sara Cajas. These dismissals violated the principles of legality, in citing reasons not provided for under law, and violated the administrative disciplinary procedures established under the collective agreement. As regards the trade union members dismissed in connection with reorganization, UNSITRAGUA names the following: Eliseo Ismael Rivera Castro, Laura Lili Alvarez Muralles de Pineda, Yuri Zumeta, Robinson Arnoldo Chevez Martnez, Jos Antonio Lpez Mendoza, Livi Deisse Ramrez Ramrez, Hctor Humberto Barrios Mazariegos, Dense Juan Fransisco Alonzo Mazariegos, and Andrs Muoz Quevedo. These dismissals violated article  of the collective agreement, which expressly prohibits dismissal in connection with reorganization and, in addition, the Office of the Attorney-General refused to submit the decision to the bipartite Joint Panel for review, as required by the collective agreement. As regards the transfers to other workplaces, also in contravention of the collective agreement, UNSITRAGUA states that the following trade union members were affected: Myrian Estela de Rodrguez, Roberto De Lon, Anabella Ortiz Mijangos, Julia Leticia Martnez Chavarra, Mirna Irecema Rodrguez Rivera, Mara del Rosario Prez y Prez, Olga Marina Chang Lpez, Adelso Pojoy Silva, Annecke Jannette Vsquez Ramrez, Enma Araceli Soto Romero, Silvia Hortensia Castillo Avila and Alcira Noem Salguero Noguera. Workers were not informed of or consulted on these transfers and, in contravention of article  of the collective agreement, the Office of the Attorney-General refused in every case to submit the decision to the Joint Panel for review, as required by the collective agreement.\n.In its communication of  July , in response to the Committee s recommendation in which it requested new information on the dismissal of Flix Alexander Gonzles from the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation, UNSITRAGUA states that the Office interfered in that worker s personal affairs and used a problem unrelated to work as a pretext for dismissing him. It also accused him of something which in law is not deemed to constitute grounds for dismissal, and thus violated the principle of legality.\n.As regards the dismissal of Rosa Mara Trujillo de Cordn, Xiomara Eugenia Paredes Pea de Galdamez and Zoila Jacqueline Snchez de Garca, all members of the trade union of workers of the Secretariat of Public Works of the First Lady of the Republic of Guatemala, in response to the Committee s recommendation in which it had requested new information showing the anti-union nature of the dismissals, UNSITRAGUA reiterates the information already sent to the Committee, and states that the anti-union nature is reflected in the fact that the union s ordinary members were severely affected.\n.In its communication of  April , with regard to the dismissal of Flix Alexander Gonzles of the Office of the Attorney-General, the Government states that the Second Chamber of the Labour and Social Security Appeals Court ruled that the worker s application for reinstatement was unfounded. The worker did not lodge any further appeal and the Court declared the case closed.\n.As regards the delay in dealing with the application for reinstatement of Luis Rolando Velsquez at the National Hospital for Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, the Government states that the case was dealt with by the Third Chamber of the Labour and Social Security Appeals Court (file No. -), and that according to the file the ruling was implemented on  October .\n.As regards the alleged dismissal of the trade union executive committee at the port enterprise Santo Toms de Castilla, the Government states that the Labour and Social Security Court of Izabal Department ordered the reinstatement of the workers concerned, but does not know whether they have actually been reinstated.\n.With regard to the allegations regarding the municipality of Puerto Barrios presented by the CGTG, the Government states that in January , representatives of the Trade Union of Workers of the Municipality of Puerto Barrios presented a complaint concerning the unjustified dismissal of  workers at a time when the municipality had already been summoned to court. The Labour Inspectorate asked the mayor to reinstate the dismissed workers, and when he refused to do so, gave him five days to explain his reasons. The mayor alleged that the summons to which the union referred was applicable only during the discussion of the collective agreement, which had already been negotiated and approved by the Labour Inspectorate the previous year, and for that reason reinstatement was not legally possible. At the workers' request, the administrative procedure was declared to be exhausted. The administrative file is currently before the Sanctions Department of the Ministry of Labour with a view to appropriate penalties being applied. The workers applied to the Labour, Social Security and Family Court, and the case is currently before the Appeals Chamber.\n.With regard to the alleged mass and selective dismissals in the municipality of Chiquimulilla, also presented by the CGTG, the Government states that on  January , Rodolfo Garca Rivas and his colleagues complained to the Labour Inspectorate that they had been dismissed. Although they were reinstated, they were subsequently dismissed again. On  March , the Labour Inspectorate visited the municipality following a complaint by the trade union s executive committee, according to which the employer had withheld  days' wages. The same situation was repeated on  April of the same year.\n.As regards the allegations regarding the municipality of Pueblo Nuevo Via, the Government states that, on  February , a group of workers complained to the Labour Inspectorate that they had been dismissed. Some of the workers have already received suitable compensation, but the case with regard to the others is still pending. The Government states that on  March , a group of dismissed workers sought the intervention of the Labour Inspectorate to obtain their reinstatement at work. The employer offered to pay them appropriate compensation but this was rejected by the workers.\n.In its communications of  November  and  January , the Government states with regard to the allegations concerning the Secretariat of Public Works of the First Lady of the Republic of Guatemala that on  March , it received notice from Lesbia Amparo Velsquez Gmez, Lilian Leticia Franco and Silvia Victoria Guzmn Muralles, regarding the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee of Workers of the Secretariat of Public Works of the First Lady of the Republic, together with a set of claims to be passed on to the Secretariat. The Labour Inspectorate dealt with this in the normal way and asked the Labour Registration Department of the General Labour Directorate whether there was already a legally constituted trade union at the Secretariat in question; this was confirmed to be the case. On  March , the Inspectorate issued Decision No. -, ordering that the existing trade union be informed of the content of the notice of establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee and of the claims, setting a deadline of three days for the trade union s response. When this period elapsed without any response from""]"

It also claims that the head of State, when referring to the teachers?salary claims, made offensive comments about the education unions.\n.In a communication dated  April , the Government states that at no time was there non-compliance on its part which would justify the complaint presented by the UDA. On the contrary, considerable progress had occurred in relation to the previous situation.\n.Firstly, the Government makes a clarification regarding the reference to the national Government (to which the Ministry of Education and Sport belongs) as the employer? For the Government, this assertion is far removed from reality. In this regard, it explains that in the early s legislation adopted by the national Congress (Act No.  and complementary legislation) provided that educational establishments that had hitherto been under the auspices of the national Government would now be directly governed by the provinces. Hence the legislation provided at that time for the transfer to the provinces of educational establishments and their teaching and non-teaching staff that until then had been under national direction. Consequently, from that time onwards no educational establishments, or any of the teachers employed there, were any longer under the control of the national Government. Hence it is incorrect to describe the national Government as the employer? There are  different sets of regulations relating to teaching, each of them applicable in their respective area of jurisdiction. According to the Government, this demonstrates that the central government is not the employer? the employers are the provinces plus the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, each having its respective territory.\n.As regards the framework agreement (provided for in section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ) and referred to in point  of the collective agreement of February ), the Government indicates that it should not be forgotten that even if reference is made to a framework agreement? what is essential is the existence of agreements between the parties in each province. On that basis, from a position already fixed internally, discussions on the framework agreement can begin with the aim of reaching basic agreements at national level. The Government indicates that section  of Act No.  of January  (implemented by Decree No. /), provides as follows: The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (currently the Ministry of Education and Sport) together with the Federal Council for Culture and Education (currently the Federal Council for Education) and the teaching unions with national representation, shall conclude a framework agreement which shall include general guidelines relating to: (a)conditions of work; (b) the school calendar; (c) the minimum teaching salary; and (d) the teaching career. The Government explains that: (i) although no meetings were held from  to  for the purposes of formulating the framework agreement established in section of Act No.  ?there were only meetings at the start of each year to discuss the minimum teaching salary, which had been fixed by agreement with the unions in some cases, while other meetings had been prescribed by decree of the Executive Authority where there was no agreement ?this inaction ceased as from ; (ii) the foregoing does not alter the fact that it is a complicated, difficult task for the various regional jurisdictions, each having its own regulations relating to teachers, to reach basic agreements in relation to the creation of the framework agreement; and (iii) this whole situation goes far beyond the possibilities of the national Government, which depends on the decisions and policies of the various regional jurisdictions within the countrys federal system.\n.With regard to the minimum teaching salary (point  of the collective agreement of February ), namely the salary threshold below which no province may set the salary of any teacher, the Government explains that reaching agreement at that time on an automatic mechanism for increasing the minimum teaching salary was a significant step forward. The new mechanism agreed upon with the trade unions entails the automatic increase of the minimum salary, which is updated each year. This joint agreement establishes that the teaching salary must be at least  per cent higher than the minimum living wage, and this adjustment would be automatic, irrespective of any agreement reached in the joint negotiation board for education. For the Government, the clause regarding the automatic increase makes it unnecessary and merely academic to hold discussions on the minimum teaching salary each year. The automatic increase is calculated on the basis of the minimum living wage. This is fixed annually by the Council for the Minimum Living Wage, with the participation of workers, employers and representatives of the national Government and of the Federal Labour Council (provincial governments). Hence, in addition to the amount established annually as the general minimum wage by this Council, there is an extra  per cent as a fixed component of the minimum teaching salary for the year.\n.With regard to the Compensation Fund referred to in the complaint from the UDA, this is designed to complement (compensate) the earnings of teachers who do not reach the established minimum threshold. The aim is to help iron out disparities in the initial teaching salary in provinces where, despite financial input into the sector and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is not possible to overcome those inequalities. This is separate from the FONID, which, simply providing incentives as its name suggests, has a totally different function from the Compensation Fund.\n.In a communication of March , the Government forwards information provided by the Ministry of Governance, Labour and Justice of the Province of Mendoza regarding the classroom allowance. It states that FLATEC brought a claim of unconstitutionality before the provincial court. However, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff. According to the Government, this demonstrates a lack of coherence in that the union renounced any local ruling but decided to pursue the matter at the international level in the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association. It also indicates that: (i) the Province of Mendoza is experiencing a severe financial emergency; (ii) in conformity with the terms of the national joint negotiations signed by the national union representatives on  February , the initial teaching salary was raised by implementing the Compensation Fund, with a further increase in the funds supplied by FONID, and stipulating that the teaching salary must now be at least  per cent above the minimum living wage, irrespective of any agreements reached in the joint negotiation board for education; (iii) the negotiations took place in accordance with all the principles of good faith negotiation. For each proposal made, appropriate efforts were made to reach agreements, within the current economic context and budget of the province; (iv) however, even though the province improved the initial proposal on several occasions, no agreement could be reached. It was here that the increase in the teaching salary was fixed by decree, chiefly safeguarding the right to education and thereby guaranteeing the resumption of classes; and (v) with regard to the classroom allowance, the provincial government considers that the whole complaint is based on the incorrect and unsubstantiated premise, that the classroom allowance is not designed to be an incentive for teacher productivity. On the contrary, the Government explains that this measure has had a direct positive impact with regard to teacher absenteeism, there has been a substantial improvement in pupil attendance and also a reduction in the number of replacement teachers required. The Government also denies categorically that the classroom allowance is a way for the legislation or Government to penalize the right to strike through substantial losses of teaching salary for just one stoppage or strike day.\n.Lastly, the Government attaches a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Second Chamber, in the case Single Union of Education Workers v. Government of Mendoza ?claim of unconstitutionality? dated  December , which calls on the Plenary Court to rule on the constitutionality of the legal provisions challenged in the case file (Decree No. / ratified by Act No.', '.The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated  November  and  May and  October  (Case No. ); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated  February and  April  (Case No. ); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated  April and May  and  February  (Case No. ).\n.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April  and February and March .\n.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos ,  and  will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In a communication of  November , the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of . It also indicates that a number of points in the collective agreement concluded in February  have not been implemented. The complainant considers that by acting in this way the Government is limiting the percentage increase in teachers?salaries and is obstructing the collective bargaining process, in violation of ILO Convention No. .\n.In an additional communication of  May , the UDA declares that the initial complaint now has the support of the Federation of Education Workers (FETE) and of the secretariat for education policies, a subordinate body of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March  in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of  per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by  per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in . As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.\n.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March . As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. /. By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. . The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .\n.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.). In particular, it reports that an application was filed by the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires against the complainant for the suspension of trade union status (file No. ///).\n.The UDA further denounces the fact that, in an unprecedented measure in the Province of Buenos Aires, the governor of the province called on , volunteers to give educational support to the almost  million pupils in Buenos Aires for the duration of the stoppage called by the teachers?unions in March , at the start of the  academic year.\n.Lastly, the complainant indicates that the summons of  March  to joint negotiations was in reality a form of manipulation and deceit in relation to the trade unions, as the State showed no inclination to engage in dialogue but pursued the restriction of the right to strike as its sole objective. It alleges that the recourse to compulsory conciliation constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the Province of Buenos Aires and also of Acts Nos  and . The UDA also reiterates that the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires initiated the procedure calling for the suspension of its trade union status.\n.In its communication dated  February , FLATEC reports that the classroom allowance ?which is an additional component to the salary structure of private tutors based on Act No.  and Decree No.  of the Province of Mendoza ?has actually been established to obstruct the regular exercise of the right to strike of private tutors, through the imposition of fines and the withholding of salary. They state that the monetary allocation constitutes remuneration, and so it entails contributions in the areas of welfare, assistance and union dues, and is to be considered in the calculation of additional annual earnings. The classroom allowance is to be paid from March  for every employee covered by Act No. and its amendments who provides services in the Directorate-General for Schools, has the status of qualified teacher and performs assigned duties on all working days in the respective month, except for absences due to sick leave or accidents or any other leave on objective grounds defined by the abovementioned legislation.\n.The complainant objects to the fact that for just one day of strike action in the month concerned, the classroom allowance is not paid, which signifies a very serious withholding of salary, amounting to some  to  per cent of monthly pay. Hence the right to strike is penalized through an excessive loss of pay, which is far greater than the amount that corresponds to the strike day.\n.FLATEC also denounces the arbitrary and unlawful failure to implement the collective bargaining procedure of the federal joint negotiation board for education, and describes the historical background to the current dispute. It recalls that, in order to cut costs in educational matters and as part of commitments for the renegotiation of foreign debt, in January  the Executive Authority proposed, and Congress adopted, Act No.  concerning the transfer of education services to the provinces. This transfer resulted in a serious imbalance in the quality of', '.The complaints are contained in communications from the Argentine Teachers?Federation (UDA), dated  November  and  May and  October  (Case No. ); in communications from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC), representing one of its members, the Argentine Union of Private Tutors (SADOP), dated  February and  April  (Case No. ); and in communications from the Confederation of Education Workers of Argentina (CTERA), dated  April and May  and  February  (Case No. ).\n.The Government sent its replies in communications dated April  and February and March .\n.In view of the fact that the complaints address identical issues, Cases Nos ,  and  will be the subject of a single examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In a communication of  November , the UDA denounces the restriction on collective bargaining for the public teaching sector by the Government, in so far as, unlike the practice followed in previous years and despite insistent complaints by the UDA, it failed to reconvene collective bargaining with a view to revisiting the issue of salaries, despite the fact that teachers?salaries have been strongly affected by rising inflation and the adverse socio-economic context of .

The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .\n.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.\n.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions\n.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers\' and employers\' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.\n.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.\n.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises\n.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration\'s opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.\n.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.\n.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores\' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.\n.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.\n.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.\n.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike\n.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section', 'attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers.

It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.\n.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike\n.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section', 'attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .\n.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.\n.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions\n.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers\' and employers\' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.\n.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.\n.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises\n.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration\'s opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.\n.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.\n.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores\' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.\n.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.\n.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.\n.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike\n.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ).

Mr Montoya was therefore granted professional III status, which increased his salary from ,. to ,. nuevos soles and, from January , to , nuevos soles. The Government adds that it is true that the labour administration authority fined SUNAT, but the fine was revoked by the higher authority in Resolution No. --MTPE//. on the basis of the arguments set out. Taking into account the Government s arguments and information and the promotion and salary increases from which union official Mr Edmstines Montoya Jara has benefited, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.\n.With regard to its recommendation concerning the disciplinary proceedings against union representatives for alleged misuse of email (Defence Secretary Ms Mara Covarrubias and communication and public relations secretary Mr Jorge Carrillo Vrtiz), in which the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiry to be conducted in that regard, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the labour administration authority ruled that SUNAT had committed no offence against Mr Carrillo because legal provisions exist concerning the use of email in public institutions; and () the labour administration authority issued an inspection order in . The Committee requests the Government to send the administrative authority s existing and future decisions concerning these two officials. The Committee observes that restricting the union s use of email is an important issue for the union and one which caused collective bargaining to break down. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that SUNAT has made improvements in its facilities for unions (such as the use of notice boards to publicize information) and points out that the union did not include the issue of email use among the matters to be dealt with in arbitration over its list of demands for ' . Although it has taken account of this information provided by the Government, the Committee recalls that workers' representatives should enjoy such facilities as may be necessary for the proper exercise of their functions, including access to workplaces and the use of email. Recalling that access to employers' facilities should not be exercised to the detriment of the efficient functioning of the enterprise concerned, the Committee suggests that the employer and the workers' organization strive to reach agreement on the modalities for the use of email.\n.With regard to the Committee s recommendations requesting the Government to send its comments on the complainant s allegations that the administrative authority authorized SUNAT (the employer) to express its views on the declaration of a strike on  and  November , the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the allegation refers to the declaration of inadmissibility (made by the administrative authority) concerning the complainant s notification of the timing of this strike; and () during the appeals procedure, the administrative authority identified irregularities in voting (the records do not state whether the decision was adopted by a ballot of members present and eligible to vote, as stipulated in the union s statutes; furthermore, the total number of members from Lima who attended the assembly does not match either the number given in other documents or the total stated in point  of the sworn declaration made by the union s executive committee). The Government adds that SUNAT s alleged authorization by the administrative authority to express its views on the declaration of a strike stems from the fact that both the union and SUNAT are entitled to challenge administrative decisions. The Committee takes note of this information.\n.The Committee takes note of the allegations made by the CATP concerning practices by SUNAT, during negotiations on SINAUT SUNAT s list of demands for ' , that go against the principles of collective bargaining and good faith (delaying tactics, lack of specific proposals during the direct negotiation phase, lack of willingness to find solutions to demands of an economic nature on the grounds that budgetary limits must be respected, counter-proposals on non-economic issues, put forward by SUNAT during the conciliation phase, that did not represent any real improvement, communication from SUNAT to the union right in the middle of conciliation proceedings instructing it to refrain from using the email system for union purposes that had always previously been accepted). The CATP adds that, in this context, the union asked for the matter to be referred to arbitration and that, although an  extra-procedural' meeting was held at which SUNAT submitted a document describing various measures taken on some of the demands included in the union s list as  SUNAT policy'  the union pointed out that these unilateral decisions could not be viewed as benefits obtained through collective bargaining, since they could be amended or revoked.\n.The Committee observes that the complainant highlights a previous case concerning SUNAT that involves the list of demands for ' , in which the Committee emphasized that the impossibility of negotiating wage increases on an ongoing basis is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. .\n.The Committee observes that the Government, as an indication of SUNAT s willingness to bargain, states that there have been collective agreements with two other union organizations operating at SUNAT, one of which is the National Federation of Customs and Taxation Workers; the Government emphasizes that arbitration with SUNAT is possible (the Government refers to an arbitration award in proceedings between SUNAT and the complainant) and that the complainant could have recourse to the same procedure for the list of demands for ' , by virtue of a  ministerial resolution, if there is a lack of good faith in bargaining, provided that the requirements set out in the resolution are met (completing a training course ' first organized in December  ' and being included on the National Register of Arbitrators). The Committee observes that the Government states that the  ministerial resolution, in accordance with legislation and the practice of the Constitutional Court, provides for the possibility of negotiating increases in remuneration within previously authorized budgetary allocations, so long as it is taken into account that any such financing must be planned using resources directly raised by the public body in question.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements denying any lack of good faith on the part of SUNAT and pointing out that SUNAT had participated in bargaining meetings to try and reach agreement during the direct negotiation, conciliation and extra-procedural phases, and that records show that discussions took place between the parties in order to reach agreement as far as possible. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the fact that SUNAT s representatives were unable to review the extensive documentation submitted by the union, as reflected in the minutes of the conciliation meeting ( September ), cannot be taken as an indication of bad faith, as the information was only received on  and  September. The Committee observes that the Government recognizes certain restrictions on the negotiation of economic provisions for budgetary reasons, although it seems that the situation has subsequently evolved from a legal point of view.\n.The Committee concludes, based on the statements made by the complainant and the Government, that the representatives of SUNAT participated in all phases of the bargaining process concerning the list of demands for ' , that there was discussion between the parties and that the employer representatives made counter-proposals (although the complainant claims that they represented no real improvement). The Committee considers SUNAT s practice of granting certain improvements in conditions to public servants, not within the framework of a collective agreement, but as unilateral decisions, even though they relate to bargaining matters (which makes it more a consultation than bargaining), to be more problematic. The Committee observes, in this respect, that the Government confirms that, during the bargaining process, SUNAT indicated that, despite no agreement having been reached, nine demands (which the complainant recognizes were related to some union demands) had already been acknowledged and acted upon, as detailed in the Government s reply. In the Committee s view, this practice does not promote collective bargaining and should be avoided.\n.The Committee observes that, in this case, as in previous cases concerning Peru, bargaining on provisions that imply increases in remuneration has run into significant difficulties in practice, and also that the applicable standards require further clarification (for instance, the state grants general bonuses to its employees). The Committee observes that, in this case, the arbitration requested by the complainant with regard to the list of demands for '  did not take place and that the bargaining process extended beyond the period it was intended to cover (as can be seen, for example, from this case and from the Government s statements regarding the date of the arbitration award for the '  list of demands). The Committee observes that arbitration in public bodies is covered by a  ministerial resolution that allows for"", ""on the declaration of a strike on  and  November .\n.In a communication dated  August , the Autonomous Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CATP), representing the complainant (the United Trade Union of SUNAT Employees (SINAUT SUNAT)), alleges that the Office of the National Superintendent of the Tax Administration (SUNAT) has engaged in practices that go against the principles of collective bargaining and good faith ever since the above union presented SUNAT with its list of demands for '  on  February . In its communication, the CATP gives a very extensive and detailed account of the various stages of the bargaining process, the main points of which are as follows: () delaying tactics and lack of specific proposals during the direct negotiation phase and lack of willingness to find solutions to the list of demands, particularly those of an economic nature, a position that SUNAT (the employer) maintained during the conciliation phase, stating that budgetary limits had to be respected; () the  counter-proposals' put forward by SUNAT on non-economic issues during the conciliation phase did not represent any real improvement; and () on  September , the eighth conciliation meeting was held; the employer representatives said that they  had not had time to review the material submitted by the union'  In response, the SINAUT negotiating committee expressed the view that such an attitude could only be interpreted as a further demonstration of bad faith and lack of real will to reach any agreement on the list of demands. At the same meeting, it was brought to the attention of the labour administration authority that, in letter No. --SUNAT/F, the SUNAT personnel management department had requested the union to restrict its use of the institutional email system to professional matters only, attempting to give the unexpected impression of being unaware that the employer had always accepted the everyday use of the system to communicate with union members and workers in general; even SUNAT itself, through its staff and representatives, has repeatedly approached the union and the workforce in general by email to state its position on various trade union matters.\n.The CATP adds that, bearing in mind that the facts outlined severely affected ' in the context described ' the normal course of collective bargaining, and added to the total lack of serious proposals from the employer and the failure to honour commitments made during discussions, together with the imposition of a new restriction that undermines free and fluid communication and coordination between the union and its units across the country, placing it at an obvious disadvantage right in the middle of conciliation talks on its list of demands, the union informed the labour administration authority that it had decided to suspend conciliation meetings. In addition, in an official letter dated  November , the union informed SUNAT of its decision to refer the dispute to labour arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Collective Labour Relations Act.\n.The CATP states that, on  October , an extra-procedural meeting was held at the offices of the Regional Directorate for Labour and Employment Promotion for Lima, to exhaust a further extra-procedural avenue in negotiating the list of demands for ' . At this meeting, SUNAT provided the union with a written document ' SUNAT SINAUT Negotiating Committee ' which mentions a set of actions implemented as  policies' by SUNAT, relating to some of the demands set out in the list. In response, the union pointed out that the  policies' being implemented by the employer are unilateral decisions that may be changed or revoked in the future on the employer s sole initiative, and they cannot therefore be viewed as benefits obtained through bargaining until a collective agreement has been signed with workers to guarantee their permanence. The meeting ended with no agreement having been reached, and on  February  the union requested the Sub-Directorate for Collective Bargaining of the Ministry of Labour to summon the parties to sign a commitment to go to arbitration. So far, neither SUNAT nor the Ministry of Labour has taken any action with regard to this arbitration request.\n.The CATP recalls, furthermore, that, with respect to the (previous) list of demands (' ), which remained unresolved, the Committee on Freedom of Association made the following recommendation in Case No. :(b)\tThe Committee emphasizes that the impossibility of negotiating wage increases on an ongoing basis is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No.  and requests the Government to promote appropriate mechanisms so that SINAUT SUNAT and SUNAT may conclude a collective agreement in the near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.In its communication of  December , with regard to the alleged infringement of the principle of free and voluntary bargaining through lack of will to bargain on any demands of an economic nature included in the list of demands, the Government states that article  of the Political Constitution of Peru and the General Act on the National Budgetary System, No. , lay down that the budget is allocated by an annual act and is governed by principles such as budgetary equilibrium, universality and unity, integrity, annuality and multiannual programming, among other things. Section  of the Public Sector Budget Act for the financial year , No. , stipulated that all state bodies were prohibited from altering or increasing any form of economic benefit. It further states that labour arbitration bodies are subject to the legal limitations set out in that Act.\n.In the same vein, the consolidated text of the Collective Bargaining Act, approved by Supreme Decree No. --TR, lays down, in section , paragraph , that workers in state bodies and enterprises that are part of the State s business activities, which are subject to private sector labour laws, are covered by the standards laid down in the above Act except where they contradict specific standards limiting the benefits provided by private sector labour laws.\n.It adds that, in legal report No. --SERVIR/GG-OAJ, the National Civil Service Authority (SERVIR) concludes, in response to an enquiry from SUNAT, that:The right of public servants [be they subject to public or private labour law] to bargain collectively is not exercised without restrictions, but is subject to legal limitations, including those governing budgetary matters. hese budgetary restrictions should also be applied if a dispute is referred to arbitration, under either form of labour law.\n.As regards applying the principle of good faith, the Government maintains that the assertions made by SINAUT SUNAT lack any substance, given that SUNAT has participated in the process of collective bargaining with a view to reaching agreement, sending designated representatives to the various direct negotiation, conciliation and extra-procedural meetings organized by the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion; evidence of this can be found in the minutes of conciliation meetings, as well as in the records of attendance, which not only show who was present, but also whether there was discussion between the parties so as to reach agreement as far as possible.\n.Furthermore, the Government states that, at the eighth conciliation meeting, SUNAT indicated that it had not had time to review the documentation submitted by the union. It points out in this regard that the documentation received, which consisted of  folders containing information on arbitration awards relating to various state bodies, was submitted through the public registry on  September  and received by the institution s representatives on  and  September. The information merited examination, which cannot be interpreted as a display of bad faith or lack of willingness to reach an agreement, given that SUNAT attended the meeting in question fully prepared to continue bargaining.\n.While it may be true that increases in remuneration and other economic benefits are restricted by public order provisions, SUNAT maintains that it has been willing to bargain on other matters, as is the case with working conditions. SUNAT states that, despite no agreement having been reached through the collective bargaining process for ' , various demands have already been acknowledged and acted upon, to the benefit of all workers in the institution who are covered by the measures taken, such as:' providing uniforms (clothes and shoes) to SUNAT staff;' transport for staff performing duties at offices located in high-risk or hard-to-reach areas: Callao Maritime Customs, Chucuito, San Luis and Santa Anita;' career path. With funding from the Inter-American Development Bank, the private consultancy GOBERNA SAC is currently designing a career path system that is structured and sustainable over time, promoting staff development within the institution;' internal competitions for management posts not considered positions of trust;' paid leave to look after immediate family with health problems, which in some cases may exceed the number of days requested by the union;' performance evaluation. The private consultancy DHO Consultores is designing a results-based evaluation system to ensure professional development and quality assurance for all workers and managers within the institution;' help with transfers;' training programme to be"", 'facts, determining responsibility and punishing those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to repeal Emergency Decree No. -, Ministerial Resolution No. --EF/ and Emergency Decree No. - so as to guarantee that the parties themselves decide whether they wish to include productivity criteria in determining wages in collective bargaining.\n.The complaints are contained in communications from the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) and the Unified Trade Union of Petroleum, Energy, Oil and Refinery Workers of the Grau Region (SUTPEDARG), dated  August and  June  respectively, and in a communication from the Federation of Petroleum Workers of Peru (FETRAPEP), dated  April . The CGTP forwarded fresh allegations by letters of  August  and  June , and the FETRAPEP in a communication of  June . The Government responded by letter of  February,  April and  September .\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  August , the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) alleges that article  of Emergency Decree No. -, published on  March , established that, in , state enterprises would conduct their pay policy for staff, whether covered by collective bargaining or not, through the award of a single productivity bonus which would not constitute a part of their basic remuneration and would be governed by resolution of the Ministry of Economics and Finance. In accordance with the aforementioned article, Ministerial Resolution No. --EF was published on  April ; this set the guidelines for the award of the Single Productivity Bonus (BUP), as well as the guidelines for simplifying the pay system of workers in state enterprises. The requirements established by the resolution for the award of the bonus in state enterprises were as follows: (a) the amount to be awarded should be set in accordance with the worker\'s level of responsibility, contribution and commitment, as reflected in an evaluation process conducted prior to the award; the evaluation criteria may be approved solely by the directorate, i.e. without the involvement of the trade union; (b) the resulting amount may be paid in instalments; (c) prior to this, the pay system must have been simplified on the basis of only two structural components (basic remuneration and consolidated bonus) and the integral remuneration agreements must have been signed in cases where remuneration exceeds , nuevo sols; (d) in the case of staff covered by collective bargaining, bonuses must be set and awarded as part of the collective bargaining process; and (e) a worker\'s total present income plus bonus (which as such may not be considered as a pay increase) may under no circumstances exceed the Maximum Income Level (TMI) established for the general manager or equivalent official in each enterprise. Similarly, the award of the BUP will depend in the last instance upon the extent to which the management objectives have been achieved, as set out in the management agreement concluded between the state enterprise and the Office of State Institutions and Bodies (OIOE), as stipulated by articles  and  of the aforementioned Ministerial Resolution. Those agreements specifically state the enterprise\'s commitments and the productivity bonus entitlement, provided that a high percentage of the planned objectives for  are achieved, failing which, no authorization will be issued to make bonus payments subject to the limits set in the agreement.\n.Furthermore, in accordance with the regulations applicable to collective bargaining, as cited by the CGTP, the directorates of state enterprises must submit to the OIOE, for its approval, the agreements signed with trade unions; this is required by Act No. , the Public Sector Budget Act; this constitutes a further encroachment upon the parties\' collective independence, above and beyond the constraints imposed by that instrument.\n.According to the CGTP, the strategy of placing the productivity bonus award exercise within the collective bargaining process is part of a policy gradually to replace the increases or compensation agreed upon with the workers. This constitutes an attempt to obviate the bargaining phase which, at present, addresses increases in remuneration, with implications in terms of compensation for service time, allowances, leave and others, in an endeavour to move on to the stage of regulating non-remuneration-related increases without any positive implications for workers\' rights and, apparently, without any extra labour costs for enterprises and with a further reduction in the Peruvian workers\' standard of living.\n.Accordingly, organizations such as the Federation of National Ports Enterprise Workers (FENTENAPU) and the Union of SEDEPAL Workers (SUTESAL) were coerced into signing their collective agreements with the respective state enterprises under the conditions imposed by the aforementioned instructions which, hence, limit the agreements regarding wage increases and, in particular, remuneration-related increases for the benefit of their members.\n.Furthermore, the members of the National Unified Federation of Health Workers (FENUTSSA) received a clear refusal from the Ministry of Health to negotiate upon the list of claims they presented this year, with the argument that, this year, the education sector required extra finances for the purpose of increasing the pay of administrative staff in various regions of the country. Similarly, the list of claims presented to the Ministry of Education by the United Education Trade Union of Peru (SUTEP), the Unified Trade Union of Education Centre Workers (SUTACE) and the National Federation of Education Administrative Workers (FENTASE) was disregarded upon grounds similar to those invoked in the health sector. All of this occurred despite the fact that salaries of public servants in health and education have been frozen for several years.\n.In its communication dated  August , the CGTP alleges that on  July  the Government handed over the railways of the state enterprise ENAFER S.A. to a consortium of private companies with domestic and foreign capital. This meant the dismissal of all workers already having undergone three staff rationalization operations involving more than , lay-offs since . The dismissals constitute a case of abuse by the Government, given that a technical study by the World Bank indicates that the staff necessary for the enterprise to function is , workers. The new operator is only required to recruit former ENAFER S.A. workers to meet its own needs; the recruitment is for one year and may be carried out directly or through third parties. In this way, the majority of the , workers will lose their jobs whereas they are above  years of age and, also, the majority of those that manage to be recruited will be so by third parties. The CGTP points out that the offers made to the trade unions by ENAFER S.A. to bring about their acceptance of the terminations was to pay compensation to the tune of  nuevo sols (less than US$) in respect of each year of service - which is equivalent to the present basic wage of an ENAFER S.A. worker with  to  years of service. This remuneration is lower than the minimum remuneration for the purpose of calculating compensation, which is currently set at  nuevo sols per year of service and an indemnity of $,. The enterprise\'s proposals were turned down.\n.The railway union representatives made a counter-proposal: recruitment guarantees for a minimum of five years; an increase in basic remuneration comprising  nuevo sols of basic wage, an ""economic package"" of  nuevo sols per month that had already been paid; a compensatory bonus of $,, etc. This counter-proposal was rejected and ENAFER S.A. sent out notarial letters to each of the , workers. These letters invited them to accept its proposal, setting a deadline of  August  for the return of the signed letters, failing which they were threatened with termination as part of a collective dismissal already accepted by the Ministry of Labour, with the loss of the $, indemnity and with not being included in the list of workers to be supplied to the new operator for recruitment purposes. The CGTP adds that, in these circumstances, it was agreed to call a strike on  August . On  August, the Government initiated indiscriminate, unjustified and brutal repression of railway workers, their spouses and children camping out around the railway stations of Chosica (Lima), Cuzco and Arequipa. This violent repression left many people injured with contusions and instances of asphyxia, above all amongst the children and women on account of the large quantity of tear gas used by the police. In Cuzco,  workers were detained. On  August, there was industrial action in Lima, organized jointly by the telephone- and dockworkers\' unions, as well as in Arequipa and Chosica to protest at the police repression.

The Government sent additional information in communications dated  October ,  February and  and  March .\n.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its previous examination of the case at its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see nd Report, para. ]:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of carrying out an economic war, the occupation and looting of stores, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee wishes to point out to the Government the importance of strong measures to avoid such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee once again draws the Government s attention to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers and employers can develop only in a climate free from violence, intimidation and fear, as such insecure situations are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for this principle.(b) The Committee regrets that the criminal proceedings relating to the bombing of the headquarters of FEDECAMARAS on  February  and the kidnapping and maltreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Noel Alvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter was wounded by three bullets) have not yet been completed, expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded in the very near future and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators of those crimes are sentenced in a manner commensurate with the severity of the crimes, so that such crimes are not repeated, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of employers' leaders or former leaders, the Committee reiterates recommendations (e) and (f) of its previous examination of the case, requesting that those leaders or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future' and regrets that in its last communication the Government stated that a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates is not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request and to report thereon. Furthermore, the Committee, as did the mission, notes with concern the information provided about new acts of recovery, occupation and expropriation of the property of an employers' leader of FEDECAMARAS. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) In relation to the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, together with the elaboration of specific steps and concrete time frames for its implementation, and counting upon the technical assistance of the ILO recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that it has initiated a process of consultation with different sectors. It requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the mission in its conclusions referred to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. Noting with regret that the Government has not yet provided a plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and expresses the firm hope that it will take, in the very near future, all steps necessary to do so and will report thereon.(e) Finally, the Committee, guided by the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, stresses the importance of immediate action being taken to create a climate of trust based on the respect of business and labour organizations, so as to promote stable and solid industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures in this regard. The Committee requests the Government as a first step in the right direction to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of the matters dealt with in this case.\n.In their communication of  November , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS state that the Government is still ignoring the recommendations made by the high-level tripartite mission. They also report new violations of Conventions Nos  and , particularly: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, president of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, president of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level state officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS.\n.In a communication dated  March , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS denounce, among other allegations, the detention, in February , without due process and in violation of the right of defence, of  entrepreneurs from various sectors including the Chairperson of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Dr Carlos Rosales Briceno, and the Chairperson of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Services, Mr Luis Rodriguez.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government reiterated its previous statements. Concerning recommendation (a), made during the previous examination of the case, the Government states that, with regard to what the Committee considers to be various and serious forms of stigmatization by the authorities directed against FEDECAMARAS, there is a long tradition of complaints of this type; FEDECAMARAS members have expressed public, and even insulting, opinions to representatives of the Government.\n.The Government maintains that, in drawing attention to any  stigmatizing statements' by members of the Government, the Committee on Freedom of Association should bear in mind that: () it is common knowledge that FEDECAMARAS openly participated as an organization in the planning and implementation of a coup d at; () it is common knowledge that FEDECAMARAS financed and collaborated in the occupation of a square for over two months by active military personnel, who declared that they were in an armed revolt against the legitimately formed Government; () FEDECAMARAS participated in, financed and implemented an illegal stoppage and sabotage of the oil industry with the announced intention of forcing the constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to resign; and () FEDECAMARAS publicly supported landowners' call for the defence of their land, including through armed attacks by paramilitary"", ""Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)\tRegarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for  October  and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)\tRegarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)\tRegarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)\tRegarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)\tObserving the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)\tRegarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)\tThe Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)\tThe Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)\tRegarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)\tRegarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(k)\tRegarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence,"", ""Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of conducting economic warfare, the occupation and looting of shops and the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, the Committee draws the Government s attention to the urgency of taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is able to exercise its rights as an employers' organization in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against its leaders and members and to promote, together with that organization, social dialogue based on respect.(b) As regards the abduction and mistreatment in  of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (the latter sustained three bullet wounds), while noting the sentencing of one of the accused to  years and eight months' imprisonment, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling issued and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes, and concerning any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its request to the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February .(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee insists that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which in turn refers to  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee regrets that the Government stated in previous communications that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable and that, in its latest communication, it merely indicates that it proceeded in compliance with the law. The Committee firmly urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Lastly, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee regrets the lack of information and further progress in this regard. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission also refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chairperson. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Observing that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement fully without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meetings held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February and October , and to implement tripartite consultations immediately.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee regrets that the Government has not appointed a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the social dialogue body fulfilling its functions, and urges the Government to do so as soon as possible.(f) The Committee, having noted the Government s observations concerning the allegations of detention and trial of employers and leaders in various sectors, regrets that once again a full answer has not been provided in relation to the individuals who are the subject of investigation procedures. As regards the cases of Corporacin Crnica and the  Da a Da Practimercados' chain, the Committee urges the Government to indicate the specific allegations against the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities, and not merely give an indication of general criminal offences, and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings and their compliance with precautionary or detention measures. The Committee again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on employers' and business leaders pending trial. As regards the allegation of the detention of the managers of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Committee requests the Government to confirm whether the charges against these individuals have been dropped or, if not, to indicate the specific allegations against them and to provide information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings; and, in view of the complainants' allegation that four of the owners and managers of this pharmacy chain had been arrested, the Committee urges the Government to indicate whether any other individuals are currently under arrest or trial, and it invites the complainant organizations to provide the Government and the Committee with any detailed information that they may have on this matter.(g) As regards the allegations of the detention of the president of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the president of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, and allegations of shadowing and harassment of the president of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Jorge Roig, given the divergences between the allegations and the Government s reply, the Committee invites the complainants to provide the Government and the Committee with additional information, including any evidence they may have, and it urges the Government, on the basis of such information, to carry out any relevant additional investigations and to keep the Committee informed on this matter.(h) As regards the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Committee regrets that the Government has not made any observation concerning their impact on social dialogue and, deeply deploring the persistence of this situation, it firmly expects that full consultations will be held in the future with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS, on draft legislation covering labour or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members.(i) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the lack of information and progress on the above issues and urges the Government to take all the requested measures without delay.(j) The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations of the IOE and FEDECAMARAS dated  May , in which it is alleged: (i) the enactment in December , without consultation with the social partners, of  national laws, including the law on job security; (ii) semblance of dialogue through communications to FEDECAMARAS by the Government, when it has already announced or adopted the measures concerned; (iii) the unilateral promulgation without prior consultation of the Decree of the President of the Republic declaring a state of emergency for economic hardship; (iv) new acts of intimidation against FEDECAMARAS; (v) approval without consultation of a new increase in the minimum wage and the value of the socialist Cestaticket in February ; and (vi) failure by the Government to implement the road map presented to the Governing Body of the ILO in March . The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations without delay so that the Committee can examine all the relevant elements.(k)""]"

(See the rd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).)\n.Subsequently, the ILO received the following communications from the complainants: National Grouping of Workers (CNT):  October and  November ; World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  November and  December ; International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  and  November  and  and  January and  February ; World Confederation of Labour (WCL):  December ; and International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW):  December . The Government transmitted observations in communications of  October,  and  November , and  and  January and  and  February .\n.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.During the most recent examination of the case, several allegations presented by the WCOTP, the ICFTU, the IFPAAW and several national confederations remained pending.\n.In a communication of  October  the WCOTP referred to the arrest of Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing on  September .\n.In its communication of  February , the WCOTP reported that on  February  Luis Muoz, a trade union leader of the Teachers' College of Chile in Valparaso, received an anonymous telephone call informing him that unless he and Andrs Reyes of the AGECH, Hugo Guzmn, leader of the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar, Mara Isabel Torres, leader of the Fifth District Teachers' College, Sergio Narvez and Florencio Valenzuela, President of the Workers in Commerce Trade Union, left the country before the month of March, action would be taken against them and their families; he interpreted this as a threat to their lives.\n.In its communication of  March , the ICFTU alleged that on  March  a peaceful national mobilisation of workers convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) to request an increase in wages, an end to the massive dismissal of teachers, an end to the privatisation of nationalised enterprises, and the respect of human and trade union rights, was violently broken up by police forces; among the injured were Manuel Bustos, the then Vice-President of the CNT, and Rodolfo Seguel, President of the CNT, who was later arrested along with Manuel Rodrguez and Luis Surez, leaders of the same organisation.\n.In its communication of  June , the Unity Confederation of Chilean Workers (CUT) furnished new information concerning the complaints presented by the ICFTU, WCL, WFTU, and WCOTP, concerning the murder of Jos Carrasco Tapia, a trade union leader of the Metropolitan Journalists' Council, on  September ; the arrest and ill-treatment of Rodolfo Seguel, President of the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), of Jorge Pavez, President of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) and Guillermo Azula, national leader of the AGECH, on  March , during a peaceful demonstration for the reinstatement of , teachers dismissed in ; the imprisonment in the Santiago Penitentiary of the following miners: Domingo Alvial Mondaca, Adran Cabrera R., Jos Delgado Z., Pedro Lobos P., Dagoberto Lpez R., Ricardo Mondaca G., Mario Santibez, Emilio Vargas M., Ral Vsquez I., Domingo Araya C., Armando Irrazbal C., Sergio Jeria I., Juan Jorguera I., Erasmo Mayolinca Ch., Marcos Sala B., Leonardo Torres G. and Yuri Vargas A., for participating in protest days calling for the respect of labour rights and denouncing tragic accidents in coal mines; appeals for relief filed by the leaders of the Federation of Trade Unions of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers before the Court of Appeals on  July , to denounce the assault against Angel Arriagada Arriagada, a leader of the Federation, on  April , and the search of the trade union office and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez on  May ; the attempted homicide of Juan Espinoza, a national trade union leader of the Confederation of Maritime Workers (CONGEMAR), when his house was set on fire while and he and his family were sleeping, in January ; the refusal to allow several CUT trade union leaders to enter the country; the arrest of former trade union leaders Luis Guzmn, who is being illegally detained at the Santiago Penitentiary for having entered the country without the Government's prior authorisation in early , and Mireya Baltra, a former national trade union leader of the CUT, who was illegally arrested in Puerto Aysn for having entered the country on  May ; the arrest and disappearance of Sergio Ruz Lazo, a former textile trade union leader, following his return to Chile in . The Government also continues to refuse to allow many trade unionists to enter the country, including: Rolando Caldern Aranguiz, former General Secretary of the CUT, and Hernn del Canto Riquelme, Luis Meneses Aranda, Mario Navarro Castro, Bernardo Vargas Fernndez, all former CUT national leaders.\n.In its communication of  August , the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Chilean Textile and Allied Workers (CONTEXTIL) described the difficulties encountered by the workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise in signing a new collective agreement, and the enterprise's refusal to recognise the workers' representatives, as well as the unfair practices undertaken by the enterprise in transferring machinery and personnel from another of its plants in order to replace the workers who were legally on strike.\n.In its communication of August , the National Confederation of Trade Unions, Federations and Associations of Chilean Workers in the Private Sector (CEPCH) denounced certain legal provisions (article , paragraph , article , paragraph , and article  of the Constitution of , Act No.  concerning political parties, section  of the Penal Code, and section  and section , paragraph , of the Labour Code), which make the holding of trade union office incompatible with affiliation in a political party, and require elected trade union leaders to sign an affidavit concerning any political affiliation.\n.In its communication of  September , the IFPAAW alleged that Eugenio Eduardo Len Gajardo, President of the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants (CNC), was informed by the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Santiago that he was not eligible to serve as President of the CNC, despite his constitutional election at the Confederation's most recent congress, on the grounds that he had been arrested and subsequently charged under the National Security Act with participating in the mobilisation of workers as a trade union leader.\n.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU referred to the arrest and assault at the hands of security forces of dozens of workers and trade unionists, after the authorities refused to authorise a national day of protest called by the CNT for  October , and denounced numerous threats to the lives of CNT leaders, and in particular against its President, Manuel Bustos, as well as the Ministry of the Interior's judicial summons of CNT leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, and their subsequent imprisonment in the Santiago Penitentiary, following their interrogation by a judge of the Supreme Court on  October .\n.At its th Session in November , the Governing Body approved, among others, the following recommendations of the Committee:a) as regards the proceedings against Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing for breach of Act No.  on arms control, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in these proceedings and the outcome of the case;b) the Committee urges the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which no replies have yet been received.\n.In its communication of  October , the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) alleges that on  October  the Government of Chile, acting through the Ministry of the Interior, filed suit against Manuel Bustos, President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) and the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), and Vice-President of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH); against Arturo Martnez, General Secretary of the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), Vice-President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Centre (CNS) and President of the National Graphics Confederation (CONAGRA); and against Moiss Labraa, member of the National Executive Council and dispute officer of the CNT and Vice-President of the National Miners' Confederation, for breach of the State Security Act in connection with the call for a general strike on  October . The Government charged the trade union leaders with inciting riots, provoking disturbances and calling for work stoppages, which led the Preliminary Hearings Officer of the Court of Appeals of Santiago to indict them and order their arrest. Their attorneys' request for release on"", 'been issued to the effect that should Mrs. Carmen Pinto again visit the Chilean Consulate General in Paris, she be personally attended by the Consul and any misunderstandings clarified. Lastly, it should be recalled once more that the prohibitions which barred these persons from entering the country were in no way related to trade union activities which they may have carried out in the past in Chile. Moreover, the Government rejects the false charges that it is adopting ""new methods of repression against Chilean trade union leaders"". The Government\'s communication states that by granting entry to the country and terminating exile, it shows its intention to return as soon as possible to the broadest institutional normalcy, so that all Chileans may choose their own destiny, in peace and free from foreign interference.\n.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that Luis Meneses Aranda, if he has not acquired another nationality, must request travel documents from the government of the country where he is residing. The Chilean consular authorities have been instructed to grant him a temporary visa for  days so that he may visit the country and personally handle his temporary or permanent residence, whichever is the case, and regularise his situation.\n.In a further communication of  February , the Government states that Messrs. Bustos, Martinez and Labraa have been released and have brought an appeal to modify the sentences handed down against them. The appeal will be heard by a higher court during the last week of February .\n.The allegations which remained pending following the most recent examination of the case in November , concerned the trial of Beatriz Brikmann; the threats to the lives of trade union leaders of the AGECH, the Teachers\' Trade Union of Via del Mar, and of the Workers in Commerce Trade Union; the intervention by police forces in a national mobilisation of workers convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) which led to the injury and arrest of leaders of that organisation; the difficulties encountered by workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise in signing a collective agreement and the enterprise\'s refusal to recognise the workers\' representatives; the legal provisions which make the holding of trade union office incompatible with affiliation in a political party; the ineligibility of the president of the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants (CNC) to hold the office to which he was elected; the assault and arrest at the hands of security forces of dozens of workers and trade unionists during a national day of protest called by the CNT in October , and continued threats against the lives of CNT president, Manuel Bustos, as well as the judicial summons of CNT leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa and their subsequent imprisonment. Since then, the Committee has received new allegations concerning the authorities\' refusal to renew the passport of Carmen Pinto, and the situation of trade unionist Luis Meneses, who was stripped of his Chilean citizenship and has been authorised to enter the country only on a temporary basis, and the sentence handed down as regards CNT trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa.\n.As regards the WCOTP complaints concerning telephone threats to the lives of trade union leaders of the Teachers\' College of Chile in Valparaiso, the AGECH, the Teachers\' Trade Union of Via del Mar, and the Workers in Commerce Trade Union, as well as the complaints filed by the CNT and the ICFTU concerning continued threats to the lives of trade union leader Manuel Bustos, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government concerning the corresponding investigations and the request for protection provided for by legislation when the authenticity and seriousness of the threat is demonstrated; in view of the numerous allegations of this nature which have been received since this case was opened, the Committee wishes to point out that a trade union movement in which trade union leaders are able to represent fully the interests of workers, in freedom and independence, cannot develop where trade unionists are threatened and live in fear; it urges the Government to undertake judicial investigations with a view to putting an end to these acts of intimidation which sow uncertainty in trade union ranks.\n.As regards the death of Jos Carrasco Tapia, a trade union leader of the Metropolitan Journalists\' Council, and the attempted murder of Juan Espinoza, a national trade union leader of the Confederation of Maritime Workers (CONGEMAR) and his family, the Committee notes that in the case of Mr. Carrasco Tapia the Government states that the matter is being investigated, although the guilty parties have not yet been identified; and that in the case of Mr. Espinoza and his family, no charges were filed in connection with the attempted arson of his home, while he and his family slept; the Committee recalls that murder and other violent acts affecting trade unionists are serious matters which require the authorities to adopt severe measures with a view to re-establishing a normal situation.\n.As regards the various complaints concerning the arrest of trade unionists, presented by the CUT, ICFTU, WFTU and CNT, concerning trade union leaders Rodolfo Seguel (CNT), Manuel Rodrguez, Jorge Pavez (AGECH) and Guillermo Azula (AGECH), of  March , for having participated in a peaceful demonstration to demand the reinstatement of , teachers dismissed during the course of , the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that these persons were arrested for obstructing the passage of vehicles and persons on a public thoroughfare, and that they were released following a summons by the Local Police Court, a court which imposes small fines for traffic violations, with the exception of Mr. Azula, in regards to whom there are no records of arrest and who is currently at liberty. As regards the arrest of a number of miners and their confinement in the Santiago Penitentiary for participating in days of protest in support of the right to work, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that, with the exception of Domingo Alvial Mundaca, who is on trial for the illegal possession of explosives and detonators and for engaging in terrorist acts, the other miners mentioned by the complainant organisation are not currently under arrest. As regards the detention of former CUT trade union leaders Luis Guzmn and Mireya Baltra, who are allegedly being detained illegally in the Santiago Penitentiary, as well as that of Sergio Luis Lazo, who is alleged to have subsequently disappeared, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that Luis Guzmn is being tried for the crimes specified in the Act on the control of arms and explosives, for forgery of public instruments, and for entering the country illegally, and is not being detained illegally, but that his confinement has been ordered by the courts; likewise, the Committee takes note of the fact that Sergio Luiz Lazo was authorised to enter the country on  June , and that he has not been, and is not currently being, detained; and that Mireya Baltra is in the country and enjoys complete freedom.\n.As regards the complaint of several trade union organisations concerning the arrest and subsequent imprisonment of trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, on charges of incitement to strike and paralyse trade, production, and public services on  October , the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government concerning the proceedings against the above-mentioned trade union leaders. The Committee expresses its concern that Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez have been sentenced to  days\' imprisonment, and Moiss Labraa to  days\' imprisonment for breach of the State Security Act, and wishes to emphasise that the arrest and sentencing of workers\' representatives for activities related to the defence of workers\' interests are contrary to the principle of free exercise of trade union rights. It notes in this connection that Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa are free and have appealed against these sentences.\n.The Committee must also express its concern with respect to the continuing numerous complaints received since this case was opened, in connection with the arrest and/or imprisonment of trade unionists, although it wishes to state that it has taken note of the fact that certain arrests for which complaints have been field (in particular, the arrest of Luis Guzmn and Domingo Alvial Mundaca) fall beyond the scope of the freedom of association and, therefore, the competence of this Committee. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that although trade union responsibilities do not confer the right to transgress legal provisions with impunity, such legal provisions should not undermine basic guarantees as regards freedom of association, nor sanction activities which, in accordance with generally accepted principles, should be considered as legitimate trade union activities.\n.As regards the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers\' Trade Union, and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez', 'that a request be made with ten days\' notice for authorisation by the Chief of the area under the state of emergency to hold meetings in public places. The National Grouping of Workers (CNT) satisfied these requirements but did not even receive an acknowledgement in reply. In view of this situation, the CNT leadership called on the workers and the population of Santiago to meet on the Plaza de los Hroes on  May at  a.m.\n.The report also indicates that on  April the authorities had prevented the holding of an artistic and cultural event at union premises of the Confederation of Leather and Footwear Workers to celebrate May Day.\n.On  May the city of Santiago was practically occupied by the police and the military. In spite of this climate, thousands of people approached the meeting place and, when the first groups formed, the police forces hurled projectiles and tear gas at them. Dozens of persons were wounded. All persons and all vehicles were checked and approximately  persons arrested, including Manuel Bustos, Vice-President of the CNT, Jorge Mills, a member of the national council of the CNT, and Humberto Arcos, an official of the Confederation of Unions of Workers in the Metal Industry. The majority of these persons were released on the same day with a summons to appear before the Police Court for having caused a disturbance of the peace.\n.Also on the morning of  May, two trade union premises belonging to the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH) and to the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) were illegally searched. Furniture and documents were destroyed or removed. The persons present were threatened, certain of them were struck, and  teachers attending a meeting at the premises of the AGECH were arrested, although organisations with a legal personality (as in the case of the AGECH) are not required to request authorisation to hold meetings at their own premises to deal with matters within their competence.\n.In its communication of  June , the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) alleges that on  April  the Director-General for Industrial Relations of the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO) notified  workers of the termination of their work contract on the basis of article (f) of Legislative Decree No. . This provision permits an employer to dismiss workers without specifying the grounds for dismissal, with  days\' notice or by paying compensation of an amount equal to the last monthly wage. According to the CTC, this permits the Government and employers, as in this case, to take discriminatory measures against trade unions.\n.The CTC states that all those affected by this measure were skilled workers, had behaved irreproachably and had from  to  years\' service in the undertaking. The only possible grounds for their dismissal are therefore their active participation in trade union meetings and activities. Furthermore, four of them were about to become trade union officials. Moreover, this measure was intended to intimidate the workers in the undertaking in order to impede their trade union action. These assumptions are substantiated by the fact that on the day of the dismissals, the two unions of El Salvador with the largest number of affiliates had convened assemblies for the purpose of putting their affairs in order following the disqualification of their leaders decreed by the Ministry of Labour. These assemblies unanimously rejected the dismissals and condemned the measure taken by CODELCO. For ten days,  of the dismissed workers went on hunger strike.\n.In its communication of  June , the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company of Chile states that on  April  it presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on  April , raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article  of Legislative Decree No. . On  May , after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the  members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union points out that the persons concerned are covered by an indefinite work contract and have more than  years\' continuous service in the undertaking. The union adds that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on  May  a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicates that it submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.\n.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleges that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants\' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since  July . On several occasions, armed and masked civilians conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers was rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home was again searched and his wife severely beaten.\n.In its communication of  September , the FISE refers to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE fears that his life is in danger.\n.Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile states in its communication of  September  that on  September police officers arrived at the Union\'s offices for the purpose of evicting the six workers referred to in a previous complaint presented by the Confederation of Copper Workers, as well as their families who had organised a soup kitchen on the premises since their dismissal by the National Copper Corporation, at a time when they enjoyed trade union ""immunity"". The police officer responsible for this eviction presented no document issued by a competent authority.\n.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, refers to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation points out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, was sought by persons in civilian clothes on  September , when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n.CONSTRAMET indicates that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno were sought by the police as of the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency,  September . Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, is under permanent surveillance, as are the Confederation\'s offices. The complainant organisation also indicates that the police authorities prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.\n.FENTATREX refers to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explains that these officials were declared responsible for the fact that  of the  workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on  September , as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which was occupied by law enforcement agents. The undertaking then arbitrarily applied sections . and . of Legislative Decree No.  which penalises unlawful acts preventing the worker from being present at his work or discharging his obligations as a worker and the direction of or active participation in any unlawful interruption or stoppage of work. The dismissals were decided without notice being given, without the right to compensation and in contravention of ""trade union immunity"".\n.FENTATREX indicates that  workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking had to take the risk of meeting in private houses to discuss a draft collective agreement since a consequence of the proclamation of the state of emergency was to prohibit meetings of trade unions which do not possess their own premises.\n.The Miners\' Confederation alleges that several trade unionists were dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining: in particular, the former official of the Lota Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), Fresia Mellado Opazo, and ten workers of Union No,  of Victoria de Lbu. It is alleged further that an official of ENACAR Union No. , Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, was disqualified from holding his union post and that workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, including the trade union official Rolando Chacana Ganza, were arrested for purported thefts of explosives. Lastly, it is alleged that, at the Agustinas de Copiapo mine, the Agustinas mining enterprise unilaterally decided to lower salaries in  and  at a time when the collective agreement was in force.\n.Finally, in a joint letter several Chilean national confederations indicate that the homes of officials of']"

The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any such inquiry and on its outcome.(d) In general, the Committee draws to the Government\'s attention the principle that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed.\n.In a communication dated  June , the ICFTU refers to a mission which it sent from  January to  February  to Central America, where among other countries it visited Guatemala. According to information received by the mission, Guatemala is living in a state of insecurity because of the persistent policy of intimidation and terror employed against the population, while the practice of arrest and disappearance has become a standard and systematic instrument of repression from which an alarming number of victims have suffered, especially trade union leaders both in the towns and in the country.\n.The ICFTU adds that the mission drew up a list of cases of arrest and disappearance, assassinations and attacks on trade union leaders and activists;  instances of arrest and disappearance and  assassinations were cited between  and May . The list of trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or been kidnapped, assassinated or physically attacked appears in an annex to this report. (This list does not include persons already cited in other cases brought before the Committee on Freedom of Association.)\n.In its communication dated  July , the WFTU refers to the kidnapping of trade union leader Felicita Floridalma Lucero, an allegation that was previously brought before the Committee in connection with Case No. .\n.In its communication dated  September , FASGUA alleges that on  September  the body was discovered of Eleazar Esa Barrera Martnez, an employee of the textile factory Fbrica de Tejidos Imperial who had been kidnapped during mass demonstrations against the increase in prices and in support of wage claims. According to FASGUA, his body was found hanging by the neck from an electric wire and bore signs of torture.\n.FASGUA adds that on the morning of  September  nurse Rita Josefina Pineda Aldana was kidnapped by armed men.\n.Finally, FASGUA alleges that on  September ,  members of the National Army supported by  artillery trucks and about  tanks launched an attack on the University of San Carlos and searched every building, including the headquarters of the University Workers\' Union where they caused extensive damage and seized trade union documents.\n.The Government states in its communications dated  August  that all the complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association communicated to it by the ILO have been passed on to the Ministry of the Interior with instructions to transmit to the Committee on Freedom of Association any information that may come to light as a result of its inquiries.\n.The Government adds that a copy of the statement it received to the effect that Floridalma Lucero y Lucero and Amancio Samuel Villatoro had disappeared has been communicated to the competent tribunal and that investigations are being conducted to determine their whereabouts. With respect to the disappearance of Julin Revolorio, Raymundo Prez, Yolanda Urizar Martnez de Aguilar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Victor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her children, Fermn Solano, Antonio Argeta and Sergio Venicio Samayoa Morales, the Government states that none of the persons cited are being held in any of the country\'s detention centres but that inquiries are being made into their whereabouts. The Government indicates that, in the case of investigations of this nature, the judiciary is duly informed by the General Directorate of the National Police through the competent tribunal.\n.The Government states further that it has collaborated closely with the judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice in the investigations into disappearances and in the habeas corpus proceedings. The Head of State has accordingly set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared; in its efforts to arrive at the truth, the Committee has conducted an investigation throughout the country, issued the necessary orders to all state security forces and invited the civilian authorities to collaborate. It appears from the investigations that the persons whose names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.\n.The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared are listed as official residents of that country. The Government indicates that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the law, the State Prosecutor\'s Office has initiated penal proceedings with the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal Branch of the Departments of Petn, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings already initiated. The Government states that in the course of the investigations conducted in the various departments of the Republic, no allegations were made regarding the existence of detention centres other than the legally constituted penal centres for preventive detention and for the serving of prison sentences.\n.The Government declares that the committee has conducted a thorough official investigation at the national level, employing all possible means at its disposal, and that its report constitutes the most thorough investigation of the problem of ""disappeared persons"" that the present Government has carried out in its efforts to establish the facts.\n.Finally, with respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal Textiles Factory, the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Directorate collaborated fully with the workers who had lodged a petition against its closure. According to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement which included the payment of compensation. The only point on which agreement was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate, concerned five trade union leaders. Charges were accordingly brought against the undertaking in June  with the competent labour tribunal which has not yet handed down its ruling.\n.The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that the Head of State has set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared and that the Committee has conducted a nation-wide investigation with the collaboration of the civilian and military authorities. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the persons listed as having disappeared are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, inquiries have been made into the whereabouts of trade union leaders Felicita Floridalma Lucero y Lucero, Amancio Samuel Villatorio and Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales. The Committee also notes the Government\'s statement that it has not yet been possible to establish the whereabouts of other kidnapped trade union leaders and members (Julin Revolorio, Raimundo Prez, Yolanda Urzar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Vctor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her two children, Fermn Solano and Antonia Argeta). The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied any details on the other  trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of  trade union leaders and members and physical attacks on another union leader. The Committee further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade union leader Alvaro Ren Sosa.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the International Labour Conference in its  Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties. It expresses its profound concern at the seriousness of a situation in which a large number of trade union leaders and members', 'case the allegation concerns the kidnapping of the brother of a trade union leader who had escaped various attempts at capture), the Committee urgently requests the Government to carry out the necessary investigations to determine the whereabouts of the persons who have allegedly disappeared and to initiate a judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties for the kidnappings or attempted kidnappings.

It appears from the investigations that the persons whose names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.\n.The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared are listed as official residents of that country. The Government indicates that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the law, the State Prosecutor\'s Office has initiated penal proceedings with the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal Branch of the Departments of Petn, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings already initiated. The Government states that in the course of the investigations conducted in the various departments of the Republic, no allegations were made regarding the existence of detention centres other than the legally constituted penal centres for preventive detention and for the serving of prison sentences.\n.The Government declares that the committee has conducted a thorough official investigation at the national level, employing all possible means at its disposal, and that its report constitutes the most thorough investigation of the problem of ""disappeared persons"" that the present Government has carried out in its efforts to establish the facts.\n.Finally, with respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal Textiles Factory, the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Directorate collaborated fully with the workers who had lodged a petition against its closure. According to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement which included the payment of compensation. The only point on which agreement was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate, concerned five trade union leaders. Charges were accordingly brought against the undertaking in June  with the competent labour tribunal which has not yet handed down its ruling.\n.The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that the Head of State has set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared and that the Committee has conducted a nation-wide investigation with the collaboration of the civilian and military authorities. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the persons listed as having disappeared are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, inquiries have been made into the whereabouts of trade union leaders Felicita Floridalma Lucero y Lucero, Amancio Samuel Villatorio and Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales. The Committee also notes the Government\'s statement that it has not yet been possible to establish the whereabouts of other kidnapped trade union leaders and members (Julin Revolorio, Raimundo Prez, Yolanda Urzar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Vctor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her two children, Fermn Solano and Antonia Argeta). The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied any details on the other  trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of  trade union leaders and members and physical attacks on another union leader. The Committee further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade union leader Alvaro Ren Sosa.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the International Labour Conference in its  Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties. It expresses its profound concern at the seriousness of a situation in which a large number of trade union leaders and members']"

It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.\n.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country\'s international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.\n.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government\'s communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .\n.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.\n.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.\n.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers\' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.\n.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.\n.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.\n.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.\n.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,\n.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.\n.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.\n.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.\n.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.\n.Lastly,', '.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).\n.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.\n.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May .

His arrest by the police a few blocks away from the enterprise for the crime of making death threats against the enterprise s manager revealed the coordination between the enterprise and the police.\n.The complainant also refers to the following anti-union practices which were recognized as such by the enterprise or the courts: (i) the enterprise, acting in cooperation with the Prosegur, Steel and Compass enterprises denied entry to officials in the Andina division, a practice which was reported and the anti-union nature of which acknowledged by the enterprise; and (ii) various complaints, appeals for protection and actions for the deprivation of rights brought by the enterprise against the CTC and its leaders, actions which were dismissed or declared inadmissible by the courts.\n.According to the CTC, the abovementioned anti-union practices illustrate the bad faith and double standards of the enterprise and its contracting enterprises during the negotiation of the framework agreement, added to which a media campaign was carried out to undermine the workers' rights to freedom of association, collective bargaining and strikes, by leading the public to believe that  was not the prescribed year for negotiating the enforcement, improvement and extension of the framework agreement. With regard to the possible accountability of the state enterprise for the abovementioned anti-union practices, the CTC emphasizes that the State of Chile is the true employer, in the form of the enterprise, which, in turn, sets up contracting and subcontracting enterprises to employ workers and make them available to the state enterprise to fulfil their respective functions. It is a conglomerate, or economic unit, which, in accordance with the provisions in section  of the Labour Code, constitutes an enterprise for employment purposes. The enterprise dominates the contracting and subcontracting enterprises and either the State has not carried out the necessary inspections of the enterprise with regard to compliance with Act No.  on subcontracting and personnel supply or, if it has, it has not reported the outcome of the inspection and the penalties to be imposed for labour violations.\n.In a communication dated  June , the CTC refers to a number of difficulties which arose in connection with the erection of a public monument in memory of the worker who had been killed during the strike.\n.The CTC also reports the following: (i) the dismissal in February  of  workers ( of whom were trade unionists) from the health-care contracting enterprise, against which legal proceedings, which are still under way, were instituted for anti-union and unfair dismissal; (ii) the alleged refusal to engage in collective bargaining of the Mantenciones y Servicios Salfa SA enterprise (hereinafter, the maintenance service contractor) in the El Teniente division, which raised an objection under section  of the existing Labour Code, relating to time limits and a lack of opportunity to enter into the bargaining process. This plea was accepted by the Rancagua Labour Inspectorate; and (iii) the alleged illegal replacement of striking workers by the integral services, which was duly reported to the Directorate of Labour, the supervisory body which, in turn, submitted a complaint of anti-union practices to the Diego de Almagro Labour Court.\n.In its communication dated  January , the Government sent its own observations and those of the enterprise. First, and with a view to explaining the situation in which the copper industry finds itself, the Government states that the fall in the price of copper has heavily affected this industry over recent years, generating job losses, the discontinuance of projects and investments, downtime and the early termination of contracts, especially in the mining support service sector, and that this has led to a steady, significant decrease in activity over recent years.\n.Secondly, the Government refers to the legal framework governing collective bargaining in Chile and emphasizes that, for the last four decades, the only binding and obligatory collective bargaining recognized in Chilean legislation has been enterprise-level bargaining. The current Labour Code retains the provisions of Act No. . Collective bargaining affecting more than one enterprise requires the agreement of the parties (section ()). For employers, bargaining with the union is voluntary or optional and they have two options: first, if the employer decides not to bargain, the workers of the enterprise who are members of the inter-enterprise union may submit draft collective agreements in accordance with the general rules (section  bis (A)); second, if the employer agrees to bargain collectively, the joint negotiating commission must be involved (section  bis (B)). The Government emphasizes that collective bargaining at the supra-enterprise level is essentially voluntary both under the abovementioned current legislation and under Act No.  which will enter into force on  April .\n.The Government states that, in light of the above, the workers represented by the CTC have the right to collective bargaining at the enterprise level, whereas collective bargaining at the supra-enterprise level is voluntary. Thus, on  August , in very encouraging conditions for the copper industry, the framework agreement was signed between the enterprise, the contracting enterprises and the CTC, following a dispute affecting industrial relations in the sector and, in particular, the operations of the state-owned copper enterprise. As a follow-up to this agreement, in ,  and , complementary agreements were concluded between the CTC and the Professional Association of Mining Enterprises and Allied Industries (AGEMA) in which the benefits agreed in the  framework agreement were enhanced. The enterprise played a facilitator and guarantor role in the signing of these complementary agreements. Act No.  on subcontracting and personnel supply specified who could participate in these negotiations. Thus, it was agreed that additional obligations for contracting enterprises should be included in the terms of service provision tender and that inspections in contracting and subcontracting enterprises should be improved by granting greater powers than those required by law. The enterprise participated in the discussions between AGEMA and the CTC only as facilitator and guarantor of the agreements, although, when all is said and done, these processes did not amount to binding branch collective bargaining within the meaning of the provisions of the Labour Code, which means that there is no specific or fixed time frame for their completion. This is not therefore a collective bargaining process at the supra-enterprise level, the obligatory nature of which would extend beyond material conditions and what has been agreed between the parties. Hence these agreements cannot carry the same effects as a statutory collective agreement or contract, notwithstanding commitments to revise and improve the agreement, which in any case require the good will of the parties.\n.The Government states that the dispute among AGEMA, the CTC and the enterprise began in July  when the CTC sent the state-owned copper enterprise, a request to enter into direct bargaining, thereby diverging from the parties' previous practice and the text of the agreements signed in , ,  and , in which the bargaining process was carried out between the CTC and the contracting and subcontracting enterprises. In this context, the enterprise, in a letter dated  July , informed the CTC that its request should be dealt with and settled directly by the contract workers, their representative trade unions and their respective employer enterprises. The CTC subsequently began to put pressure on the state enterprise by calling a work stoppage which culminated in the blocking of the public road linking the Diego de Almagro area with the El Salvador division camp and in the occupation of those facilities, thus preventing access and jeopardizing industrial safety.\n.The Government states that it was against this backdrop that the Chilean paramilitary police force carried out the operation which began on the night of  July and resulted in the death of the worker, Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, in the early hours of the next day. It also states that in order to shed light on the events surrounding his death two investigations are under way which, to date, have not been closed or finalized: one is an internal military police investigation and the other, in which the CTC is a complainant, is being led by the Office of the Public Prosecutor. With a view to further clarifying the facts, it should be noted that the National Human Rights Institute also filed a criminal complaint against those responsible for the death of the worker, Mr Quichillao Lpez.\n.With regard to the complaints concerning the anti-union practices of the Directorate of Labour, the Government emphasizes that this body is deeply committed to freedom of association and that its actions in defence of its principles comply with legal and constitutional standards: (i) in respect of the dismissals which reportedly affected workers from various contracting enterprises, it has not been possible to gather all the available information on the complaints received and the status of judicial and administrative proceedings (with regard to the allegations of"", ""is around  per cent of all its workers. If the rate of union membership among supervisors is not similar to that of List B workers (operators), this is due solely and exclusively to the personal decision of the workers who carry out those functions. There is no interference by the enterprise in that decision-making process.\n.The enterprise states that it has signed agreements with the complainant on a number of occasions, which is why it cannot understand the claim of discriminatory treatment between FESUC and the FTC. The courts also reached this same conclusion in two of the four judicial proceedings initiated by FESUC against the enterprise in which very similar allegations to those in this case were made. In two of the proceedings, the claim was rejected, dismissing the existence of discrimination between trade unions, and the other two proceedings are still ongoing.\n.With respect to the allegation that FESUC does not have the same level of influence as the FTC in the appointment of representatives to the enterprise s board, the enterprise indicates that, under its Corporate Governance Act No. , one of the two worker representatives on the board is appointed from a shortlist presented by the FTC (as the only organization representing List B workers) and one member is appointed from a shortlist put forward by ANSCO together with FESUC (both have to agree because both represent the enterprise s supervisors).\n.With regard to the alleged threats of dismissal, the enterprise states that, while its senior management publicly expressed the need to adjust its costs and number of supervisors as part of measures to respond to the period of economic difficulty it is facing, those statements were made against the backdrop of a depreciation in the price of copper, which is public knowledge and in no way represents anti-union conduct. In the circumstances, the mining companies have had to reduce their costs to optimize their operations. The enterprise s divisions agreed, in their collective instruments, on the so-called  redundancy packages'  which include a series of benefits well above the level of those that workers would be legally entitled to receive on termination of service, as an incentive for them to leave.\n.The enterprise states that there were no threats of job losses because of worker participation in trade unions or in activities organized by them, and that the reasons for adjusting staff numbers are related to market changes and to the difficult economic situation the enterprise is facing, and thus in no way constitute threats of job losses associated with the exercise of freedom of association by List A workers. The termination of  unionized workers at the national level can in no way be qualified as arbitrary and was never intended to affect the freedom of association of FESUC or the trade unions affiliated to it. In that context, in October , each division began reducing its numbers of supervisors, which in some cases involved supervisor redundancies or, in others, dismissals owing to the enterprise s need to adjust staff numbers to respond to requirements. The enterprise highlights that the numbers of workers carrying out supervisor tasks at the national level actually rose by  per cent from  to date, increasing from , to ,. On the other hand, the total number of workers carrying out operator tasks fell by  per cent in the same period, as at the beginning of  the total number of operators was , and by the end of  it was ,. This situation, in addition to the fact that greater numbers of List B workers agreed to the redundancy packages, justified the fact that the reduction in staff numbers affected the supervisor category and not the operator category. Furthermore, the cost-reduction measures (with respect to reducing worker numbers) also affected another category in the enterprise, namely List E, which includes the enterprise s managers, who were affected by management restructuring in some of the divisions. Therefore, these measures were not centred solely on workers in the supervisor category.\n.The enterprise states that it did not engage in anti-union practices aimed at hindering the functioning of FESUC by changing its quorum at the time of the dismissal of  supervisors in October . It reports that the Andina division did not know which workers were going to stand as candidates in the election and that ultimately the termination of the employment contracts of  workers affiliated to the List A Supervisors Trade Union of Andina was made through voluntary redundancies. The workers opted for the redundancy package provided for in the collective agreement in force and agreed to change the grounds for termination to voluntary redundancy. The redundancy package was the workers' preferred option because it gave them access to greater benefits than the option of termination of services owing to the need to adjust staff numbers to the enterprise s requirements. Consequently, in accepting the redundancy package, the workers received, thanks to compensation calculated on years of service, sums of money greater than those agreed. The enterprise states that the workers, individually and after consultation with their trade union representatives, agreed to change the grounds for termination to voluntary redundancy. The enterprise also states that there has always been a high proportion of List A workers of the Andina division affiliated to trade union organizations of FESUC, which stands at  per cent. This is why  of these workers were affected.\n.With respect to the allegation of police intervention in the strike, the Government and the enterprise state that the eviction decree was issued by the provincial governor of El Loa to stop the trucks blocking access to the Radomiro Tomic division as part of a legal strike held by the List A Supervisors Trade Union of that workplace, in the context of a collective bargaining process at the end of . The enterprise indicates that the strikers prevented non-striking workers from entering the division, including workers from contracting and subcontracting enterprises. While the enterprise recognizes the right to strike, any strikes held must respect the rights of other workers of the enterprise and/or of contracting and subcontracting enterprises who, as they were not involved in the collective bargaining in question, had to provide the services for which they had been hired.\n.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant alleges that a national copper enterprise discourages supervisors from union membership; that the law discriminates against the complainant in the systems for representation on the enterprise s board; that the functioning of the complainant s trade unions has been hindered by the dismissal of hundreds of members; that the right to strike was violated through an eviction decree issued by the provincial governor; and that several trade union leaders were called in for questioning by the police in relation to their participation in a peaceful strike.\n.The Committee also observes that, in addition to those allegations, in the present complaint the complainant recalls allegations that were examined by the Committee in Case No.  presented by the same complainant organization in  [see st report of the Committee of March , paras ' ]. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the Government has not implemented the recommendations made by the Committee in that case, which referred to the need to take legislative measures in relation to articles ,  and  of the Labour Code. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s statement that, on  April , that is to say after the presentation of the complaint, Act No.  entered into force, modernizing the labour relations system and reforming chapter IV of the Labour Code, and implementing the recommendations made by the Committee in Case No. , derogating, inter alia, articles ,  and  of the former text of chapter IV of the Labour Code. The Committee observes that, according to the Government, in its latest observations published in  in relation to the application of Conventions Nos  and , the CEACR noted with satisfaction the derogations of the provisions mentioned. The Committee welcomes the legislative changes derogating the provisions in line with its recommendations in Case No. .\n.With regard to the allegation that the enterprise discourages supervisors from union membership since they are in positions of trust (the complainant indicates that while List B workers (operators) have a union membership rate of  per cent, List A supervisors have a rate of . per cent), the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that: (i) it respects the exercise of freedom of association of all its workers, operators and supervisors alike, who are free to join a trade union organization of their choice, which is demonstrated by the high percentage of unionized workers in the enterprise of around  per cent of all its workers; (ii) it does not distinguish between trade union organizations, and FESUC (supervisors) and the FTC (operators) have participated in the various collective bargaining opportunities that have arisen over time; (iii) if the rate of union"", ""mass dismissals in the health-care contracting enterprise, the enterprise states that the decisions taken by the enterprise are not within its corporate control and that, in any case, the dismissals were carried out as part of a restructuring process. The state copper enterprise adds that, at the time of the dismissals,  per cent of the workers were trade union members and were registered with the primary trade union affiliated to the CTC (to date these figures still stand)); (ii) regarding the move to reprimand the Gardilcic Andina trade union,  per cent of the associates requested the Labour Inspectorate to provide a certifying officer to take part in the process of reprimanding the union leadership. After a public notice of a meeting had been posted, a decision to reprimand the union leadership was adopted by a vote on  November  (in which  men and  women participated). The Government explains that the Labour Inspectorate does not interfere in the validation of the grounds of a reprimand and that, in the event of false accusations, it is the responsibility of the organization itself to annul the reprimand or adopt measures to resolve any conflict arising within the organization. All requests to annul a leadership reprimand are dealt with by the labour courts; (iii) the illegal replacement of striking workers participating in the collective bargaining process of the integral services was recorded by the Chaara Labour Inspectorate and reported to the Directorate of Labour, which, in turn, submitted a complaint of anti-union practices to the Labour Court, which resulted in an agreement approved by the court on  March  and the closure of the case on  May ; and (iv) as for the allegation that the maintenance service contractor in the El Teniente division refused to engage in collective bargaining, it did so under section  of the existing Labour Code, that is to say it raised an objection relating to time limits and a lack of opportunity to enter into bargaining, which was accepted by the Rancagua Labour Inspectorate.\n.With regard to the possible effects of the CTC s criticism of the labour reform, the Government understands that the organization has a legitimate right to disagree with the Government s views when the latter introduces legislation on collective bargaining and to promote a complete revision of Chapter IV of the Labour Code.\n.The enterprise denies the allegations that it used direct or indirect psychological pressure or physical force on workers during the bargaining process, and submits that the general accusations levelled against it are not based on specific facts, but on assertions of interference by the State in this regard. The enterprise also denies having committed acts of union interference, reiterating that these, too, are unsubstantiated accusations. With regard to the mass dismissals of the contracting enterprises' workers who were involved in the strike, the enterprise, as the principal in the subcontracting system, states that it does not intervene in the dismissals of the contracting enterprises' employees. Its sole interaction with the contracting enterprises is limited to establishing, in advance, the tendering terms which are ultimately transferred to the resulting civil-law contract, which are also signed by the contracting enterprises, as any further involvement in the management and administration of each enterprise s human resources would be inappropriate. The enterprise states that the complaint does not contain any factual evidence of collaboration to undermine trade union activity and that, to the contrary, it has acted as a mediator or facilitator of agreements and intervened only when it was possible to promote agreement between the parties which might be linked to matters within its remit as principal, without interfering in trade union or worker organization matters in the processes mentioned above.\n.With respect to the public monument in memory of Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, the Government indicates that the situation which arose during the process to authorize its construction stemmed from the actions or decisions of either the Council for National Monuments or the Ministry of National Assets, in which the enterprise played no part. Although the authorization and putting in place of the memorial undermined the legitimate exercise of a right in rem associated with the mining easement owned exclusively by the enterprise, the monument has been built and set up in that location without waiting for the orders which revoked the authorization.\n.The Committee notes that, in this case, the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC), which comprises workers in a subordinate and dependent relationship with contracting enterprises of the enterprise, denounces the excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, and it also alleges that during negotiations to improve and expand the framework agreement concluded in  between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises, various anti-union practices occurred in several of these enterprises.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant: (i) on  August , a framework agreement was concluded between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises (according to the complainant, the enterprise, dominates the contracting enterprises); (ii) this framework is the only supra-enterprise collective instrument that embodies rights and obligations relating to the workers' remuneration and social protection;; (iii) although the framework agreement does not specify a renewal date, it was extended through negotiations in ,  and , that is to say within the minimum periods established in the national legislation for the renewal of collective instruments, meaning that negotiations should have been conducted in ; and (iv) on  July , the CTC submitted an application for the enforcement, improvement and extension of the agreement and, faced with the reluctance of the enterprise and its contracting enterprises to start the negotiation process (they argued that the negotiations should be held in , not , and that the enterprise was facing a difficult economic situation due to internal production conditions and the low price of copper), the CTC launched a lawful strike on  July .\n.In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s contention that: (i) the drop in the price of copper has significantly affected the copper industry in recent years, leading to job losses and the discontinuance of projects and investments; (ii) Chilean legislation recognizes only one binding and compulsory level of negotiation: the enterprise level (supra-enterprise negotiation is essentially voluntary); (iii) while the framework agreement between the enterprise, the contracting enterprises and the CTC was concluded on  August , the complementary agreements negotiated in ,  and  were concluded between the CTC and the contracting enterprises which form the Professional Association of Mining Enterprises and Related Industries (AGEMA). The enterprise participated in these negotiations only as a facilitator and guarantor; and (iv) on  July , the CTC broached the possibility of direct negotiation with the enterprise, thus breaking with the parties' previous practice. On being faced with this situation, the enterprise responded that this request should be settled directly between the contract workers, their representative trade union organizations and the respective enterprises employing them, at which point the CTC began to put pressure on the state enterprise, calling a stoppage that would result in the occupation of facilities and the blocking of a public road.\n.In relation to the alleged excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, the Committee notes that, according to the CTC, the Government and the police report annexed to the complaint, on  July, the Chilean paramilitary police force carried out an operation in the El Salvador division, which resulted in the death of the worker Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, who died of a gunshot wound in the early hours of the next day. The Committee notes that according to the CTC and the Government, two investigations are being conducted in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding his death: one by the paramilitary police force (which, according to the complainant, lacks credibility, legitimacy and impartiality) and another by the Public Prosecutor s Office, in which the CTC is the complainant. The Committee notes that to date, both investigations are ongoing. It also notes the Government s statement that, with a view to further clarifying the facts, the National Human Rights Institute has filed a criminal complaint against those responsible for the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez. The Committee recalls that in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ). The Committee deeply regrets the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez and urges the Government to keep""]"

The Government recalls the report of the direct contacts mission to Costa Rica (October ) and the report of the Committee of Experts, , which includes Costa Rica in its list of cases of progress, specifically with regard to Conventions Nos. ,  and . Both reports clearly and openly state the improvements which have been made in labour legislation, improvements which go even further than the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the allegations are no longer relevant or have any legal basis.\n.The Government adds that, contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Government of Costa Rica, pursuant to the agreement reached with representatives of the major trade union organizations in November , began drafting regulations to improve the understanding and implementation of Act No. . The draft was transmitted for consultation to the representatives of the major trade unions, so that they could suggest amendments to the text and then, on the basis of consensus, the final version could be drawn up.\n.It is essential to point out that the Government of Costa Rica, on  August , through a unique move in the history of labour legislation in Costa Rica, designed to bring the country up to date, reinstated the Central Labour Council and submitted a total of  international Conventions and  Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference for consultation to this national tripartite body. The Government is willing now and in the future to maintain permanent and open dialogue with this body on issues of national interest.\n.The Government states that the administration or management of termination funds does not fall to solidarist associations alone. In practice there are provisions, on the basis of a collective agreement, governing trade union participation in the administration of dismissal compensation funds. At all events, the Government reaffirms its decision to support and make the necessary improvements to the Bill on occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly by the previous Government. Of interest to this case, and as called for by the Committee of Experts, is the fact that the Bill does not restrict the administration of dismissal compensation funds to solidarist associations but has clearly made provision for trade union and cooperative organizations to be involved.\n.The Government points out that the complainants\' comments on section  of the Labour Code which prohibits strikes in the public services and the agricultural sector are no longer valid because a Bill on public employment drawn up with ILO technical assistance has been finalized and put before the Legislative Assembly. This Bill, inter alia, governs the right to strike by public servants in non-essential services in public institutions and defines the public services in which strikes are prohibited or restricted, in particular, through the establishment of minimum services. The provisions which drastically restricted strikes are therefore being repealed. As the situation stands, and since the Bill was drafted with ILO technical assistance, it is clear that the exercise of the right to strike, in general terms, complies with the principles of ILO supervisory bodies, which is why the comments made by the complainants in this regard have no legal or factual basis.\n.With regard to collective bargaining in the public administration, the Bill on public employment was submitted to the Legislature in April  and published in the Official Journal (La Gaceta) on  July , in accordance with the national and international commitments made by the previous government. The Bill, inter alia, sets out the principles and general standards governing individual and collective relationships between the central and decentralized public administration and their employees, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. Thus, in respect of collective bargaining in the public sector, Title V of the Bill clearly recognizes the right of association and trade union membership of public employees and the rights derived therefrom. Similarly, it governs the collective bargaining system in the public sector, establishing the scope of application, guarantees for the efficient operation and continuity of essential services, in addition to the aims, conditions, procedures and limits of collective bargaining recognized at the national, occupational and institutional levels.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government reports that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, through its competent administrative bodies, has dealt diligently and objectively with all the proceedings instituted by workers and their representative organizations with regard to the dispute in the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd., Proyecto Islas enterprise. These administrative proceedings ultimately led to far-reaching agreements which ended the dispute.\n.In a document dated  April , Mr. Luis Pablo Zuiga Morales, representing SITAGAH and FENTRAP, informed the Ministry of Labour and Social Security that workers on banana plantations , ,  and  belonging to the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. had been on strike for three days because the enterprise was refusing to negotiate the rates of pay for various tasks with standing committees, in accordance with the direct agreement. He also requested that the representatives of the enterprise be summoned to a meeting with a view to reaching a settlement. It should be noted that, far from criticizing the workers\' standing committee, the union\'s request defends and promotes it, contrary to what is stated in the complaint presented to the ILO. On the same day,  April, there was a meeting between the parties to the dispute, at the request of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, at which an agreement was reached, thus ending the strike. On  April  the parties met to begin the negotiations provided for in the formal statement ending the strike. The negotiations were delayed on several occasions between then and  May  because the employer\'s representatives failed to attend. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, throughout this situation, remained diligent and committed to establishing dialogue and understanding, as the records show.\n.Nevertheless, the Government adds, although another meeting had been called for  May , a new unexpected strike broke out throughout the plantations belonging to Geest Caribbean, Proyecto Islas, Sarapiqu, in the province of Heredia. At that point, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security took steps once again to reach a settlement. In this context, a number of meetings were organized, which in some cases met with opposition from the enterprise, and it was arranged for the parties to the dispute to meet on  May . On the same day, through the mediation of the Minister of Labour and Social Security, the parties, namely the representatives of the SITAGAH organization and the Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. enterprise met in the office of the Minister and signed an agreement to end the dispute. Subsequently, several meetings were held in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to monitor compliance with the terms set out in the agreement.\n.To date, the third item in the agreement is still to be resolved, hopefully in the next few days, since the legal representatives of the enterprise and the trade union organization attended the tenth meeting of the Committee on Work on Plantations held at the ILO, Geneva, Switzerland.\n.The Government considers that the complainants are misrepresenting the facts by contradicting what they themselves stated in item  of the aforementioned agreement dated  May , to the effect that ""both parties place on record their gratitude to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, Dr. Farid Ayales Esna, for his timely and valuable mediation in this matter. Thanks to his diligence, the parties reached an acceptable agreement in the interests of industrial peace in the Sarapiqu area."" ""Both parties"" means the Geest Caribbean Americas enterprise and the SITAGAH trade union. This was how the situation stood and on the principle of good-faith bargaining and legal security, The Ministry of Labour and Social Security, by acting as mediator and finding a solution to the dispute has shown its commitment to ensuring respect for the terms agreed between the parties, and the case of Geest Caribbean has been no exception, as is clear from the documents appended. They show the Government\'s repeated efforts to ensure implementation of the terms of the oft-mentioned agreement dated  May , in full respect of the ""pacta sunt servanda"" principle.\n.In this context, the Government considers that the complaint is rash, irrelevant and damaging to the principle of good faith since the process leading to implementation of the items in the agreement is under way, and the SITAGAH union leadership signed an agreement settling the dispute, but days later lodged a complaint with the ILO against the', ' of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.\n.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer\'s arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer\'s prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers\' legitimate strike.\n.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members\' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers\' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.\n.In April , the employer\'s arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers\' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer\'s representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer\'s arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers\' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.\n.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.\n.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.\n.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.\n.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.\n.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of  November  reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to  (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.\n.With regard to the allegation of restrictions on collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, the Government points out that it has been negotiating specific legislation on public employment which contains express provisions on the settlement of collective disputes and the right to strike in this sector since the beginning of  with trade union organizations (including the complainant). With regard to ruling No. - of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on  March , following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the', ' of whom were directly hired by the employer and the rest of whom are subcontracted.\n.SITAGAH alleges that Geest Caribbean Americas Ltd. has, since , hired and subcontracted many migrant workers who did not have residence papers (Nicaraguans), who are not entitled to rights under Costa Rican labour law, using them as reserve labour and thus forcing Costa Rican banana plantation workers to accept below-average conditions of work, safety and pay. The employer\'s arbitrary actions led the workers to contact the SITAGAH union leadership in September , and hundreds of them joined the union, but the enterprise suppressed the union and prevented it from functioning, including by: dismissing workers who had joined the union, and elected union representatives; discriminating in terms of pay and conditions of work; unfair practices against the SITAGAH trade union; rescinding the freedom of trade union officers to meet with workers without the employer\'s prior authorization; promoting solidarist interference in trade union matters and resorting to violence (with a private police force to prevent unionization) and armed repression (workers were injured and beaten by the police force), in order to break the workers\' legitimate strike.\n.SITAGAH adds that since September  it has been applying for recognition and calling for a solution to its members\' labour problems. Even though it has formally recognized the SITAGAH trade union, the employer continues to take up all labour issues with workers\' standing committees affiliated to solidarist organizations, refusing to discuss them with SITAGAH.\n.In April , the employer\'s arbitrary acts went as far as cutting workers\' wages by more than , colones per fortnight, which provoked a three-day strike (,  and  April ), as a result of which the employer enterprise promised to negotiate with SITAGAH on wage issues, on the basis of an agenda drawn up by the trade union. However, the employer did not sit down to the negotiating table, but instead launched mass dismissals of workers belonging to the trade union, and subcontracted workers were removed from the plantation. The enterprise immediately called the migration authorities to ensure that the migrant workers who had no residence papers and who had joined the union were expelled from the country. This situation compelled the workers to call a further strike for - May . However, on  May, using a court order to open up a public right of way as an excuse, the Costa Rican police force, supported by Geest Caribbean private guards, under orders from the employer\'s representative, moved in on the strikers,  of whom received bullet wounds, three of them serious, leaving some workers unable ever fully to work again, and imprisoned  workers. To date, two workers are still missing. It should be pointed out that the workers were engaged in a peaceful strike - the strike had not been declared illegal because there were no grounds for doing so in view of the employer\'s arbitrary acts and the legitimacy and fairness of the workers\' demands - however, the enterprise dismissed more than  workers, violating the trade union immunity (fuero sindical) to which they were entitled as the dismissals included representatives, elected by workers, on standing committees on the negotiating committee that discussed labour issues on the plantation with the Government and enterprise, and on grass-roots trade union committees, and included members of the trade union executive committee.\n.Furthermore, SITAGAH points out that despite the fact that the problem has not been resolved and that SITAGAH boasts considerable membership among workers still in employment, the employer is preventing trade union officers from meeting freely with workers, using private guards to deny them access to plantations, preventing workers from holding meetings and communicating with persons outside the plantation. As these workers have stated, the Geest Caribbean plantation in Sarapiqu is a concentration camp with flowers, where trade union officers must ask permission of the employers even to speak with members, but may not communicate with other workers or hold union meetings. SITAGAH encloses a memorandum from the banana plantation manager, written and signed in his own handwriting, addressed to the private guards and stating that Mr. Pablo Zuiga is authorized to speak with trade union members. Nevertheless, the private guards have been present during conversations and workers could not express themselves freely.\n.Meanwhile, the enterprise and the advisory body belonging to the banana industry solidarist movement in Costa Rica, the John XXIII Social School, in the midst of a labour dispute, in an effort to interfere in the dispute and pressurize workers to join the solidarist association, have set up four solidarist associations which have been approved by the Ministry of Labour without questioning their illegal origin.\n.According to the complainant, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an Act on trade union immunity (fuero sindical) but in practice, as in cases such as this, it is not being applied. The Constitutional Chamber legitimized trade union immunity in an erga omnes ruling which is also not being implemented by any state judicial or administrative body in Costa Rica. The State approved legislation prohibiting solidarist associations from interfering in collective bargaining or acting against trade unions. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security continues to approve solidarist associations set up to damage trade unions, and approve the collective bargaining carried out between the employer and standing committees belonging to solidarist organizations, thereby excluding the trade union. In the specific case mentioned in this allegation, the employer has set up four solidarist associations and negotiates remuneration with the standing committee.\n.The first labour policy move by the present government was to fire on and suppress the workers of the Geest Caribbean Americas company, who were engaged in legal strike action.\n.In its communications dated  May,  and  October , the Government stated that the essence of the allegations contained in the general part of these cases harked back to the issues dealt with in Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association and the most recent observations of the Committee of Experts, and that these matters were examined by a direct contacts mission to Costa Rica from  to  October . The Government points out that the current administration has shown particular interest in bringing labour legislation into line with the principles contained in Conventions Nos. ,  and , has set up a legal framework specifically designed to protect trade union organizations and their officers, and introduced various bills applying, with ILO technical assistance, the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, and by the Committee of Experts. The Government refers specifically to a recent Act, No.  of  November , which, inter alia, amends the Labour Code (with regard to trade union guarantees) and the Act on solidarist associations, bringing them into line with the provisions of the aforementioned Conventions. The Government adds that the claims of inequality between solidarism and trade unionism are false. On the contrary, the Government, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee as mentioned above, submitted a Bill to the Legislative Assembly on the establishment of an occupational capitalization and economic democratization fund, which changes the regulations governing compensation upon termination of a contract, thus making it a genuine right for all workers and placing trade unions and solidarist associations on an equal footing with regard to acting as administrators of these funds. Similarly, the Act of  November  reduces the minimum number of workers needed to set up a trade union to  (in other words, the same number as that required to set up solidarist associations), provides adequate protection against anti-union discrimination and updates the fines for violation of the Labour Code and ILO Conventions.\n.With regard to the allegation of restrictions on collective bargaining and strikes in the public sector, the Government points out that it has been negotiating specific legislation on public employment which contains express provisions on the settlement of collective disputes and the right to strike in this sector since the beginning of  with trade union organizations (including the complainant). With regard to ruling No. - of Constitutional Chamber IV, the Government points out that, under the constitutional guidelines in force, the employment relationship between the public administration and its public servants is subject to ""particular or special criteria"" which do not allow the application of labour legislation on arbitration since the latter was drawn up to cover labour relations in the private sector alone. The Government adds that since public sector workers are barred access to arbitration machinery on the basis of the aforementioned ruling, on  March , following discussion with the Central Labour Council (a tripartite body), the Regulations on collective bargaining for public servants were issued, allowing collective bargaining and the exercise of trade union rights in the public administration. These Regulations remain temporarily in force while the corresponding legislation is being passed since, as a result of tripartite consultation, a Bill on the settlement of collective disputes in the public sector will be submitted to the']"

The Committee recalls that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country. Moreover, this concept is not absolute, in the sense that a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population and that the Committee has previously stated that the hospital sector may be considered an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ].\n.The Committee reminds the Government that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government but with an independent and impartial body [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting that responsibility still lies with the administrative authority to determine the legality of a strike, the Committee considers that although restrictions may exist on strike action in the cases referred to above, it would be necessary for an independent body to have previously determined the scope of such a restriction and therefore once again requests the Government to take measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that if it is necessary for a strike to be declared illegal, responsibility for that declaration lies with an independent and impartial body.\n.With regard to the alleged inadequate functioning of compensatory guarantees, the Committee recalls that as regards the nature of appropriate guarantees in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, restrictions on the right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting the contradictory versions from the complainants and the Government regarding effective access to conciliation and arbitration, the Committee trusts that the Government will ensure the adequate, impartial and speedy functioning of conciliation and arbitration proceedings in order to restore the unions' confidence in compensatory guarantees and consequently will not pursue the examination of this allegation.\n.As regards the alleged adoption of social security regulations without prior consultation of the trade unions and also the lack of guarantees concerning good-faith dialogue, the Committee notes the Government s indication, regarding Supreme Decree No. , that following certain observations made by various parties, steps were taken towards amending the aforementioned decree. In this regard, the Committee has emphasized the value of consulting organizations of employers and workers during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests and has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. Observing that in the present case Decrees Nos  and  were replaced by Supreme Decree No.  of  January , the Committee hopes that in future full consultations will be held with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations on draft labour or social legislation which affects their interests or those of their members and consequently will not pursue the examination of this allegation.\n.As regards the favouritism and interference in union matters by the public authorities and the creation of parallel unions alleged by the COB, and specifically the situation of the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers, where the Ministry of Labour reportedly recognized an executive committee which had not been democratically elected, the Committee recalls that when two executive committees each proclaim themselves to be the legitimate one, the dispute should be settled by the judicial authority or an independent arbitrator, and not by the administrative authority [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. Observing that the Government has not sent its observations on these allegations, the Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on this matter.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)\tThe Committee once again requests the Government to take measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that if it is necessary for a strike to be declared illegal, responsibility for that declaration lies with an independent and impartial body.(b)\tWith regard to the favouritism and interference in union matters and the creation of parallel unions alleged by the Bolivian Workers' Federation, the Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on this matter."", 'administration, as well as from the aforementioned legal and constitutional authority which confers its management on the Higher Court of Justice. The judiciary has a non-repealable mission to guarantee the essential rights of individuals, sanctioning behaviours which harm those rights and ordering that any such unjust harm be redressed, it being essential to ensure the adequate and uninterrupted operation of its various organs in order to guarantee peaceful and healthy coexistence and the maintenance of citizens?rights.\n.It is precisely because the right to strike is not an absolute right but a relative one, subject to the reasonable limits laid down in the corresponding regulations, as prescribed in articles  and  of the National Constitution, that it is open to regulation. Such regulation must flow not only from an act but also from the entity whose responsibility it is to provide the justice service. It was within this context that it was decided to establish a framework for (rather than prohibit) the exercise of direct action, while focusing less on the internal organization of the union or decisions taken by it. In short, whether we are looking at autonomous or delegated regulations, the provinces Higher Court of Justice, as head of the judicial authority, acted within the bounds of its competence when issuing the decision in question.\n.The President of the Higher Court of Justice notes in this connection that under point  of the operative part of the decision in question, recourse to direct action must be preceded by an explanation from the union of the labour-related reasons for the conflict, together with any suggestions it may have in that regard, the aim of this being to find a rapid and effective means of resolving the complaints. The need for rapidity is obvious, in order not to hinder the normal functioning of the justice service and to foster the search for consensus solutions in the specific matter of conflicts.\n.Where the decision by SITRAJ to take direct action liable to result in suspension, interruption or paralysis of any part of the service is concerned, point  of the operative part requires the establishment of rules regarding the means by and form in which this is to be communicated to the court, whereby the period of notice must be reasonable, namely five days before the stoppage or strike is due to begin. The reason for this is common knowledge; as the chief authority, the Higher Court of Justice must notify each of its offices in the capital and elsewhere in the province of the unions decision so that they can take the measures necessary to ensure an uninterrupted service. This period of notice is absolutely essential in order to avoid situations such as the calling of a stoppage just one day after the Higher Court of Justice is informed of that action. By way of illustration, it can be seen from file No. S-- that SITRAJ, on  June , informed the President of the Court that action would be taken as from  a.m. on  June , with the signing of timesheets and withdrawal from the workplace without allowing for continuity of the service to be duly safeguarded or for news of the action to be communicated to other courts and to members of the Public Prosecutors office.\n.The union is also required to provide, together with its communication regarding the planned stoppage, a copy of the executive committees call to assembly, of the agreement and resolution and of the ad hoc book or list recording the attendance of members at the assembly in question, in addition to which point  stipulates that the minimum services to be maintained during the period of the conflict shall be established. In regard to such services, there are already decisions of the Court, formulated differently to the current one, which specified the manner in which these were to be organized. With respect to the requirement as to the submission of a copy of the executive committees call to assembly, of the agreement and resolution and of the ad hoc book or list recording the attendance of members at the extraordinary assembly convened solely for the purpose of discussing the taking of direct action, in no way does this imply interference in the union or its internal affairs.\n.If the unions own statute, in sections (j),  and others, regulates the arrangements for giving notice of such a meeting, then requesting the union to provide a copy to the Court when it announces its decision and to specify the days on which the strike is to be held, responds, as the Higher Court of Justice states, to the basic principle of law whereby anyone calling for the adoption of a given situation must provide due grounds therefore. This requirement has everything to do with transparency and with the execution of the strike in due form and good faith, and can in no way be interpreted as undermining the rights of the appellant union or restricting the right to freedom of association. It is, moreover, a minimum requirement in the face of a decision to take strike action, which, as everyone knows, can be taken only as a final, extreme measure, whence the requirements laid down in the unions own statute for taking such a decision.\n.In conclusion, none of the measures that have been ordered undermine, infringe or impair the right to strike or the right to freedom of association of the unions members, nor do they constitute an unfair practice or restrict the unions right to agree on direct action, which it can do subject to respect for the aforementioned conditions. Finally, the foreseen consequences also become irreproachable since the possibility of pursuing a declaration of lawfulness or unlawfulness is clearly unquestionable in regard to the exercise of the right to strike. Then, the whole question of remuneration for duties not performed, in addition to the reasons already set forth in the contested decision, is a principle that has repeatedly been supported by the Higher Court of Justice of the nation.\n.The reasons which led the union to decide in favour of direct action are specified in the notifications received by the Higher Court of Justice. These refer specifically to: () salary adjustment:  per cent as at June ; and () disagreement: (a) with the sums being disbursed by the judiciary for the division of IT and buildings infrastructure; (b) regarding the advancement of lower-ranking employees; (c) regarding the Act on Independence; and (d)with the docking of salaries for days of work stoppage, among other things.\n.The question of the budget/wage review and financial independence formed the main grounds for the demands made by the judicial employees, triggering the various strikes held in . It is essential that attention be drawn to the following in the interests of clarifying the matter, which is inextricably linked with the budget. The budget for the expenditure and resources of the judiciary for  was drawn up in accordance with strict prudential standards laid down by the General Budget Directorate of the province of Corrientes (files Nos --, -- and --), having regard to the financial cap imposed by the nation vis--vis the province, pursuant to the Act on Fiscal Responsibility, No. , and with due consideration at all times being shown for upcoming projects and tasks, such as the implementation of  new legal offices, staff strengthening in those offices experiencing a serious human resources deficit, continuation of the computerization plan and of the buildings and equipment infrastructure policy, all of these goals being closely and indissociably linked in the interests of achieving the Courts prime objective of ensuring the effective administration of justice, with priority being given to the improvement of working conditions for judicial employees.\n.An initial presentation to the Provincial Executive of the budget for , in the amount of ,, Argentina pesos (ARS), provided for a salary increase of  per cent for judiciary employees. However, following application of the financial cap imposed by the nation on provincial budgets, the credits allocated for salary increases were reduced by per cent. The budget ultimately approved, by Act No. , was in the amount of ARS,,, the reductions made having been ARS,, under item  (staff costs), ARS,, under item  (consumer goods), and ARS,, under item (fixed assets). It is to be noted that the body in charge of the financial administration system has the constitutional authority to modify the amounts proposed by the Judiciary. Despite the decision by the Higher Court of Justice to ratify the initial amount of ARS,,, the provincial legislative power, pursuant to the Act on Fiscal Responsibility, No. , which requires that the national and provincial governments maintain a balanced budget, was obliged to reduce the amounts proposed.\n.Also affected by the imposed reduction ?although to a lesser extent ?were capital investments. It was stated at the time that the decision signalled the intention to respect the state policy in regard to the judiciary and the provisions of the Act on Fiscal Responsibility. Within the', ""in relation to the complainants' allegations regarding the creation of the Register of Substitute Teachers, that the Register was created ' in conformity with Law No.  ' by ministerial resolution in  as a register of professionals who should be ready to provide educational services in case of a paralysis of labour in the education sector. The Government indicated that it does not understand in what way the creation of this Register violates freedom of association rights.\n.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organizations object to the following, considering that they violate the principles of freedom of association with regard to the right to strike: () Act No.  published on  March  in the Official Journal, which declares regular basic education an essential public service; () Supreme Decree No. --ED regulating Act No.  (providing, inter alia, that the Ministry of Education or the Regional Directorate of Education may issue an opinion on the admissibility of a strike or declare a strike illegal and creating the National Register of Supply Teachers to replace teachers on strike); and () Resolution No. --ED which, in accordance with the challenged Act No. , declared the National Strike staged on  July  by FENTASE inadmissible and Decree No. --TR, the amended consolidated text of the Collective Labour Relations Act, which, according to the complainants, contains requirements for calling a strike which are impossible to fulfil in practice.\n.The Committee notes that the Government indicates that: () with regard to Act No.  which declares regular basic education an essential public service, this in no way affects the constitutional rights of workers or the workers' rights recognized by the international conventions and treaties ratified by the Government, given that this Act is intended to grant the Ministry of Education the power to prevent pupils at the initial, primary and secondary levels from missing classes due to a strike or work stoppage by teachers. The purpose of declaring regular basic education an essential public service is to ensure the continuity of the education service, with the exception of school holidays, in public educational institutions providing regular basic education, as a result of which the principal and vice-principal of these institutions must remain in their posts; () Supreme Decree No. --ED regulating Act No.  regulates measures designed to ensure the continued provision of the education service in public educational institutions providing regular basic education at the initial, primary and secondary levels in the event of a work stoppage by the managerial, teaching, auxiliary, administrative and service staff; () for the purposes of the regulations concerned, a work stoppage by the managerial, teaching, auxiliary, administrative and service staff of public educational institutions providing education at the initial, primary and secondary levels shall be understood to mean any form of suspension of the education service in such institutions by unilateral decision of the staff concerned, regardless of the reason given, how it is termed and the manner in which it is carried out; () these regulations are consistent with the provisions of section (j) of the amended consolidated text of the Collective Labour Relations Act, approved by Supreme Decree No. --TR, establishing that essential public services shall include services other than those listed as determined by law (when a strike affects essential public services, the striking workers shall ensure that the staff required to prevent the total interruption of the service concerned and ensure the continuity of the necessary services and activities remain in their posts); () with regard to the creation of the National Register of Substitute Teachers, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Regulations issued under Act No. , approved by Supreme Decree No. --ED, this register was created under Ministerial Resolution No. --ED as a register of professionals who are qualified to provide the education service in the event of a work stoppage by the managerial, teaching, auxiliary, administrative and service staff; and () with regard to Ministerial Resolution No. --ED, this was issued taking into account the provisions of section  of the amended consolidated text of the Collective Labour Relations Act, approved by Supreme Decree No. --TR, which provides that strikes carried out by workers covered by the labour conditions of the public sector shall be subject to the provisions of that Act, as well as the provisions of section (c) of the same amended consolidated text which provides that a decision to call a strike shall be notified to the employer and to the labour authority at least ten working days in advance when it concerns essential public services; moreover, section  of the same text provides that where a strike affects essential public services, workers involved in a dispute shall ensure that the staff required to prevent the total interruption of the service concerned and ensure the continuity of the necessary services and activities remain in their posts. FENTASE was under the obligation to communicate the decision to call a strike to the employer and to the labour authority at least ten working days in advance and ensure that the staff required to prevent the total interruption of the service and ensure the continuity of the education service in the educational institutions providing regular basic education remained in their posts. Since it failed to fulfil this obligation, the strike was declared inadmissible.\n.The Committee recalls that basic education is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term namely, one which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population (the only services in which the right to strike can be prohibited or seriously restricted) but points out that it is acceptable in this sector to establish a minimum service which respects the following principles:  A minimum service may be set up in the event of a strike, the extent and duration of which might be such as to result in an acute national crisis endangering the normal living conditions of the population. Such a minimum service should be confined to operations that are strictly necessary to avoid endangering life or normal living conditions of the whole or part of the population; in addition, workers' organizations should be able to participate in defining such a service in the same way as employers and the public authorities.' The Committee has stated, for example, that minimum services may be established in the education sector, in full consultation with the social partners, in cases of strikes of long duration [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ].\n.The committee observes that, following developments in legislation and the constitutional tribunal decision, the right to strike may be exercised in the education sector but minimum services must be maintained. Bearing in mind the principles set out in the preceding paragraph, the Committee considers that establishing a minimum service in the education sector is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association. However, the Committee observes that section  of the Collective Labour Relations Act grants the administrative labour authority the power to establish minimum services in the event of a disagreement between the parties concerned, in the case of a strike in essential public services. In this regard, the Committee observes that, following an analysis of the conformity of Peru s legislation with Convention No. , in its  observation, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that the Government indicated in its report that: () in September , the Labour Committee of the Congress of the Republic entrusted the National Council for Labour and Employment Promotion (CNTPE) with the task of revising the General Labour Act, and () the CNTPE appointed to that end an ad hoc committee whose work was ratified by the CNTPE plenary meeting on  October  and referred to the Congressional Labour Committee and that the draft is currently on the agenda of the Congress plenary for discussion.\n.The Committee recalls that  the determination of minimum services and the minimum number of workers providing them should involve not only the public authorities, but also the relevant employers' and workers' organizations. This not only allows a careful exchange of viewpoints on what in a given situation can be considered to be the minimum services that are strictly necessary, but also contributes to guaranteeing that the scope of the minimum service does not result in the strike becoming ineffective in practice because of its limited impact, and to dissipating possible impressions in the trade union organizations that a strike has come to nothing because of over-generous and unilaterally fixed minimum services [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee expects that the revision of the General Labour Act will be adopted and will be in full conformity with the Convention so that in the event of a strike in essential services the determination of minimum services and the minimum number of workers providing them involves not only""]"

The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos.  and ) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. ,  and ) by the International Organisation of Employers.\n.Cases Nos.  and  were last examined by the Committee at its November  meeting and Cases Nos.  and  in February . (See respectively th Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (November  and February-March ).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. .\n.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated  May  (for Case No. ),  August  (for Cases Nos. , ,  and ),  January  (for Cases Nos.  and ) and  February  (for Cases Nos. ,  and ).\n.In addition, in a communication of  June , several employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of ,  and  January .\n.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.\n.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.\n.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.\n.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.\n.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. .) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.\n.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.\n.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September , the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.\n.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these measures corresponded to the needs of agrarian reform. While realising that the persons mentioned in the IOE's complaint cannot take advantage of their position as COSEP leaders to evade the consequences of an agrarian reform policy, the Committee must nevertheless point out with concern that these measures have allegedly affected a large number of leaders of the employers' organisation in a discriminatory fashion. It expresses the hope that the persons in question will be fairly compensated for their losses as provided for by law.\n.The Committee notes the Government's statement that there is no trace of any expulsion order against Mr. Frank Bendaa, the Vice-President of COSEP. Given the contradiction between the complainants' version of the facts and that of the Government, the Committee can only recall generally, that the expulsion of leaders of employers' or workers' organisations from their country for having been involved in activities linked to their position, is not only contrary to human rights, but also interferes in the activities of the organisations to which they belong (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada) para. ).\n.The Government has not made a specific reply to the requests for information concerning the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day. It confines itself to stating that no citizen was deprived of his liberty on that occasion. The Committee notes this information but regrets that the authorities banned the celebrating of this Private Enterprise Day.\n.The Committee notes that the newspaper La Prensa is once again circulating freely and expresses the hope that this measure will be final. It would, indeed, recall that the right of an employers' or workers' organisation to express its opinions uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. ).\n.Lastly, as concerns the suspension of the state of emergency, the Committee refers to the considerations set out hereafter concerning the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.The Governing Body must consider, in the present case, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry under article  of the Constitution. This complaint contains allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No.  based mainly on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional freedoms, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the absence of free collective bargaining; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the Government's failure to consult the COSEP.\n.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it has adopted conclusions which were approved by the Governing Body, and which contain precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases are in a number"", "".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, alleging infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee has examined these matters on several occasions, in particular in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot in September-October  by a study mission, and in February and May  (see th and th Reports, approved by the Governing Body at its nd and rd Sessions (February-March and May  respectively)).\n.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted further information in communications dated  June and  August . The Government supplied information in communications dated  June and  and  October .\n.During its examination of the cases in May , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:(a) As regards the drafting of a new Labour Code, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations are still being held with employers' and workers' organisations, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. Noting with concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted by the Government, the Committee requests the Government to hear the views of this organisation and to send rapidly an assistance request to the Office. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code, while expressing the firm hope that all the opinions expressed by the employers' and workers' organisations will be taken into account, without exception.(b) Concerning the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that a new Act on communications media has been adopted. It notes with regret that the Ministry of the Interior retains the power to impose temporary suspensions on the media. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the decrees violating freedom of speech in economic matters, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.(c) With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a meeting concerning the agricultural sector has taken place and that such a meeting will be organised in the near future for the industrial sector. The Committee asks the Government to indicate whether the COSEP was invited to these meetings as an employers' organisation. The Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing tripartite consultations commission on international labour standards, composed of all workers' and employers' organisations without exception. It requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in that respect.(d) As regards the detentions, the Committee notes with interest that Messrs. Alegra, Quant and several CUS trade unionists have been released. The Committee deplores that these persons have been detained for long periods and expresses the hope that they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in conformity with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the arrest on  June  of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, and on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza.(f) The Committee once more requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged detention of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.(g) Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November Session the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.\n.In its communication dated  June , the IOE alleges that, following a meeting held two days earlier by the Association of Coffee Producers of Nicaragua (UNCAFENIC), affiliated to COSEP, at which the policy of the Coffee Committee, an official body, was seriously challenged, the Government decided on the immediate expropriation of the land owned by the Association's President, A. Alemn Lacayo, and by N. Bolaos Geyer and J. Cuadra Sommabira, officials of UNCAFENIC and of the Association of Coffee Producers of Magalpa, the town where the meeting was held. The officials were accused by the Government of refusing to negotiate and of encouraging anarchy, confrontation and the breakdown of negotiations. In fact, UNCAFENIC is in total disagreement with an economic policy that is being imposed on it through so-called negotiations and is making its opinion known to its members, which is the role and the right of an employers' organisation.\n.In the view of the IOE, the expropriation is very much in the spirit of similar measures that have been brought to the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association on numerous occasions, which are designed to intimidate and muzzle the leaders of COSEP and of one of its principal members, the Union of Agricultural Producers of Nicaragua (UPANIC).\n.The IOE mentions another instance of arbitrary confiscation of land belonging to a COSEP leader that was ordered as a reprisal after COSEP criticised the Government's economic policy. The day after the holding of a meeting on  July  in Estelli to prepare COSEP's General Assembly, the Government confiscated the land of the President and host of the preparatory meeting, Jos Mara Briones.\n.The IOE recalls that the President of the Republic announced in a statement on  January  that no more land would be confiscated. According to the IOE, the fact that the Government has gone back on these recent undertakings, as it has done so often in the past, should at last convince the Committee that the Government is pursuing its discriminatory policy, is endeavouring to destabilise COSEP and is accordingly continuing to attack its leaders systematically.\n.In its communication dated  August  the IOE submits a number of comments on the earlier replies - or lack of replies - from the Government. The IOE believes that the Government is attempting to pass off a number of measures it claims to have taken as a policy of consultation and negotiation with the social partners, including in the areas coming within the purview of the ILO. The Government's statements to this effect are misleading, if not downright untruths: either the measures were never taken by the Government or never involved COSEP or its members as such, or else they were taken in very different circumstances from those suggested by the Government. The IOE cites a number of examples.\n.According to the IOE, for instance, the national tripartite consultations in the agricultural sector that are presented as tangible evidence of negotiation involved neither COSEP nor UPANIC, a member of COSEP, as such, but were held with people hand-picked by the Government from among the members of COSEP and UPANIC. Neither COSEP nor UPANIC, as such, were able to have their views represented.\n.The IOE goes on to state that, when these organisations got together as best they could to discuss how to put across their points of view, which happened to disagree with the Government's economic policy,"", "".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.\n.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua.

They were originally submitted to the ILO prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . The Government has since sent information on these cases in communications dated  April and  and  May .\n.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence committed by employers against workers, trade union activists and union leaders in the sugar cane plantations and alcohol distilleries of several States of Brazil, and specifically in Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, and to the failure of the Government to put a stop to them.\n.In the case of the State of Pernambuco in particular, the allegations concern the banning of union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and even the assassination of union leaders or their relations simply for having demanded the implementation or renewal of collective agreements. Moreover, the complainants claim that a situation bordering on slavery and forced labour has developed in these regions, with workers being recruited clandestinely from other parts of the country to break the strikes called by the regular workers belonging to FETAPE.\n.The complainants explained that following a general strike in  the , rural workers of the sugar cane growing area secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From  to  other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the labour court and the workers became aware that they could take legal action to have them enforced. As from , however, the employers began to sabotage the agreements by recruiting huge numbers of unemployed labour from the drought-stricken areas of Sertao and Agreste. They got rid of the regular workers and replaced them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from those areas. After the harvest, these workers returned to their home districts and had no way of demanding that their rights be respected before a labour court.\n.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation which, after the  elections, relaxed its supervision. In order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers from the Meta area, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or tripling the daily volume of work provided for in the collective agreements. They brought private militia onto the sugar plantations, armed with revolvers and rifles, to ""pay a visit"" on the inhabitants and ""supervise"" the payment of the workers. Some workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; the land was laid waste and turned into cane-fields. The employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the labour standards stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting union dues from their pay. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations and punished workers who, as union delegates, attempted to keep in touch with their union. Some whose names were communicated by CONTAG and the ICFTU received death threats, were locked up in private prisons or were even assassinated, especially in the Goias area.\n.In the State of Sao Paulo the FTIC is unable to organise the workers of the state alcohol distilleries and is being prevented from establishing occupational associations that could subsequently become trade uninons. In Gantus , for instance, an agro-industrial enterprise with a distillery in Tupa, the employer has circulated a petition among the staff stating that the workers recognise that the enterprise is well run and rejecting the ""inopportune"" remarks of Pedro GonUales da Silva, a union leader responsible for unionisation in the State of Sao Paulo. The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.\n.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers\' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country\'s land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic\'s solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.\n.The Government notes that in May  collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed. It encloses a copy of the agreements between the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo and the Federation of Agricultural Workers, the Sugar Industries\' Trade Union and the Alcohol Industries\' Trade Union of the State of Sao Paulo. It adds that the Ministry of Labour has decided to set up a special group to enforce the agreements and encloses a copy of the relevant Decree No.  of  March . The Decree specifies that the special group is to be tripartite and must submit its first conclusions and recommendations within  days of the entry into force of the collective agreements. A collective agreement was signed on l September l between the rural workers and sugar cane plantation employers in the East of Pernambuco.\n.In addition, on  September  the Ministry of Labour set up a special tripartite committee to examine complaints of infringements of freedom of association made against the Government of Brazil through the ILO. The committee was required to submit its conclusions to the Labour Rights Commission of the Ministry of Labour. The tripartite committee met on  January  and concluded that the facts that had been denounced were of the utmost gravity. They concern the assassination of rural workers, death threats, acts of violence against rural workers and union leaders, the holding of persons in private prisons, the existence of private militias, the practice of torture by the federal police of Goias, attacks and other violations of human rights. The committee concluded that it could not reach any conclusion without concrete information as to whether or not steps had been taken by the competent authorities to deal with each complaint, how far the inquiries had advanced and whether the State Prosecutor\'s office had been informed. The committee therefore asked the Ministry of Labour\'s legal adviser to request the Office of the Ministry of Justice for detailed information on each case. Thereafter, on  March , the Minister of Labour requested the Minister of Justice to investigate all the complaints submitted in Case No. . As soon as it has received the necessary information on this case, the committee will be in a position to reach definitive conclusions.\n.With respect to Case No. , the regional labour delegation of the State of Sao Paulo has called for an investigation of the matter. This delegation indicated that on  August l the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries accepted that the matter was now closed. The Government attaches to its reply communication No. .-./, signed on  August l by the said Federation, from which it appears that the conflict which had developed at the TUPA-SP enterprise had been resolved.\n.The Committee observes that the complaints were submitted prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . Nevertheless, they contain extremely serious allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo and in alcohol distilleries. The allegations refer to the banning of trade union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and the assassination of union leaders.\n.The Committee has noted the very specific information submitted by the Government', "".The allegations presented by complainants in these two cases werecontained in the following communications: from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  June and  November \n.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Rightto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its initial complaint of  June , the ICFTU explains thatworkers in the service of the State launched several protest actions at thenational level in April  against Government Decree No.  of freezing for two months (April-May) the salaries of federal public employeesand of workers in state enterprises. In view of the Government's refusal toenter into discussions with the trade unions, the trade union organisations inthe public sector and state enterprises decided to call a -hour strike on \n.The ICFTU goes on to say that the strike was called by  trade unionorganisations, representing  / million workers, and that it paralysed fullyor partly all the sectors affected by the Decree, namely oil, metallurgy, theports, electricity, chemicals, banks, railways, mining and telephones. Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees. On  May the co-ordinating committee requested a meeting with theMinisters of Labour and of the Economy. The former did not open negotiationsand the latter refused to receive the workers' representatives.\n.The Government called in the army to repress the strike and to occupythe Petrobras and Duque de Caxias oil refineries in the State of Rio deJaneiro. At the Cubatao refinery in Sao Paulo,  workers coming off a shiftwere forced by the army to stay and work the following shift - which meantsleeping and eating in the refinery.\n.At EMBRAER, an aeronautics enterprise at San Jos dos Campos in theState of Sao Paulo,  workers were dismissed, including the works committeeand trade union leaders. The aeronautics police forced the strikers at bayonetpoint to return to work.\n.At the Jaguariri copper mines in the State of Bahia,  workers,including  trade union leaders, eight members of the works committee and tendirectors of the Public Employees' Association were dismissed.\n.Still in the mining sector, at Carajs in the State of Par,  tradeunion leaders of the local association were dismissed and expelled from theiraccommodations (which belong to the enterprise); they were warned that theywould be expelled on  May. Twelve workers from Puerto de Santos were alsodismissed.\n.In a subsequent communication dated  November , the ICFTU furtherindicates that since  November , , workers from the MetallurgicalTrade Union of the Volta Redonda National Iron and Steel Company are on strikeand are occupying the plant to secure the recovery of the  per cent wagelosses of recent months, a wage readjustment of . per cent for the monthof July, the reinstatement of  of their colleagues who were dismissedfollowing an earlier strike, and a six-hour working day on the basis of threedaily shifts.\n.On  November , the ICFTU continues, the police and the army raidedthe plant at  p.m., using tear-gas and sub-machine guns; they killed fiveworkers and left dozens seriously injured. The trade unionists who were killedare Joao Carlos Barroso, William Fernandez Leita, Wladimir Freitas Monteiro,Victor Adriani and Vincente Silva. According to the ICFTU, the plant is stilloccupied by over , armed soldiers and surrounded by tanks.\n.The WFTU, in its complaint of  November , denounces the events atVolta Redonda and claims that , workers are on strike and that, inaddition to the five workers who were killed (and it cites the same names asthose given by the ICFTU),  were injured and four persons - Mauricio Plata,Jos de Almayda, Osvaldino Gmez and Marcelino Alvez - are missing. The WFTUadds that on  November ,  workers from the National Iron and SteelCompany of Rio de Janeiro, together with workers from the Casa Piedra MiningCompany in the State of Minas Gerais, came out on strike in solidarity withthe workers of Volta Redonda and that five workers were injured inconfrontations with the army.\n.The ICFTU, however, in a letter dated  January , amends itsprevious letter stating that three, not five, workers were killed: Mr.Fernandes Filho and Mr. Freitas Monteiro who were shot, and Mr. Barroso whodied after his skull was broken by blows.\n.The WCOTP, in its letter of  November , denounces the violentintervention by the police (with tear-gas and cavalry charges) on  October\n.In its first reply of  February , the Government furnishes acertain amount of information and observations concerning the allegations madeby the WCOTP concerning the alleged anti-union reprisals against teachers,students and employees of the University of Sao Paulo on  October during a demonstration in respect of pay claims. In this connection theGovernment states that the Regional Delegation for Labour of Sao Paulo, whichit consulted on the matter, had informed it that employees of the universityhad indeed organised a campaign in front of the headquarters of the Governorof the state with a view to obtaining better salaries within the framework ofthe municipal election campaign of . The Government confirms that thepersons concerned held several public demonstrations but claims that none ofthese took place near the Governor's Palace or involved a dispute with thestate military police. The Government states that an investigation is beingcarried out by the competent bodies of the Government of the State of SaoPaulo to determine who was responsible.\n.In another reply, dated  April , concerning allegations by theICFTU in respect of anti-union reprisals against public employees and workersin state enterprises, following a -hour strike in support of pay claims in\n.The Government goes on to explain that the presence of the military inthe Duque de Caxias oil refinery was designed to protect public property andavoid it being damaged and that this helped to ensure that the strike remainedpeaceful.\n.Still according to the Government, the workers who were dismissed atPorto Santos have all been reinstated following negotiations.\n.The Government states that the account given of the events which tookplace at the EMBRAER enterprise is inaccurate. It maintains that on  and August  workers of this enterprise went on strike claiming a  per centwage increase with the support of the Metallurgical Trade Union which hadremained inside the plant on  August when the strikers occupied the works. On\n.As regards the dismissal of the three trade union leaders, BeneditoCarlos de Sousa, Francisco Assis de Souza and Joao Pedro Pires, a judicialinquiry was opened before the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Sao Josdos Campos to determine whether there had been serious misconduct constitutingjust grounds for the dismissal of the said trade union leaders. In the courseof the appeal lodged by the dismissed leaders, the enterprise proposed anagreement, which was ratified. According to this agreement, the leaderssecured the guaranteed maintenance of their rights as though they had not beendismissed on just grounds. This agreement was approved by the regionaltribunal of the second region of Sao Paulo.\n.Thirty-three of the  workers whose dismissal had been approved bythe trade union were reinstated in the enterprise.\n.The Government concludes its statement on this allegation by specifyingthat the strike in question was judged to be illegal by the Sao Paulo LabourCourt as a result of which, at the time, the workers concerned were deemed tohave committed serious misconduct. At the same time, the Government claims, noone was dismissed on unjust grounds.\n.The Government refutes, moreover, the allegations concerning thedismissal of  trade union leaders at Carajs in the State of Par.\n.More generally, the Government specifies, as regards the pay freeze forthe months of April and May  of federal public employees and of workers instate enterprises, that in fact Legislative Decree No.  of  providedfor a . per cent pay increase for August  based on the cost of livingfor April , and that Act No.  of  established . per cent payincreases for November  based on the cost of living for May .\n.As regards the allegations made both by the ICFTU and by the WFTUconcerning the social conflict in November  within the National Iron andSteel Company at Volta Redonda in the State of Rio de Janeiro, the Governmentstates, in a further communication dated  April , that thismixed-economy company is one of the largest iron and steel works in thecountry and that it generates thousands of jobs and is a major source offoreign currency. The Government confirms that on  November  a strikebroke out among the , workers of this enterprise, as stated by the WFTU(not , as stated by the ICFTU).

In view of the Government's refusal toenter into discussions with the trade unions, the trade union organisations inthe public sector and state enterprises decided to call a -hour strike on \n.The ICFTU goes on to say that the strike was called by  trade unionorganisations, representing  / million workers, and that it paralysed fullyor partly all the sectors affected by the Decree, namely oil, metallurgy, theports, electricity, chemicals, banks, railways, mining and telephones. Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees. On  May the co-ordinating committee requested a meeting with theMinisters of Labour and of the Economy. The former did not open negotiationsand the latter refused to receive the workers' representatives.\n.The Government called in the army to repress the strike and to occupythe Petrobras and Duque de Caxias oil refineries in the State of Rio deJaneiro. At the Cubatao refinery in Sao Paulo,  workers coming off a shiftwere forced by the army to stay and work the following shift - which meantsleeping and eating in the refinery.\n.At EMBRAER, an aeronautics enterprise at San Jos dos Campos in theState of Sao Paulo,  workers were dismissed, including the works committeeand trade union leaders. The aeronautics police forced the strikers at bayonetpoint to return to work.\n.At the Jaguariri copper mines in the State of Bahia,  workers,including  trade union leaders, eight members of the works committee and tendirectors of the Public Employees' Association were dismissed.\n.Still in the mining sector, at Carajs in the State of Par,  tradeunion leaders of the local association were dismissed and expelled from theiraccommodations (which belong to the enterprise); they were warned that theywould be expelled on  May. Twelve workers from Puerto de Santos were alsodismissed.\n.In a subsequent communication dated  November , the ICFTU furtherindicates that since  November , , workers from the MetallurgicalTrade Union of the Volta Redonda National Iron and Steel Company are on strikeand are occupying the plant to secure the recovery of the  per cent wagelosses of recent months, a wage readjustment of . per cent for the monthof July, the reinstatement of  of their colleagues who were dismissedfollowing an earlier strike, and a six-hour working day on the basis of threedaily shifts.\n.On  November , the ICFTU continues, the police and the army raidedthe plant at  p.m., using tear-gas and sub-machine guns; they killed fiveworkers and left dozens seriously injured. The trade unionists who were killedare Joao Carlos Barroso, William Fernandez Leita, Wladimir Freitas Monteiro,Victor Adriani and Vincente Silva. According to the ICFTU, the plant is stilloccupied by over , armed soldiers and surrounded by tanks.\n.The WFTU, in its complaint of  November , denounces the events atVolta Redonda and claims that , workers are on strike and that, inaddition to the five workers who were killed (and it cites the same names asthose given by the ICFTU),  were injured and four persons - Mauricio Plata,Jos de Almayda, Osvaldino Gmez and Marcelino Alvez - are missing. The WFTUadds that on  November ,  workers from the National Iron and SteelCompany of Rio de Janeiro, together with workers from the Casa Piedra MiningCompany in the State of Minas Gerais, came out on strike in solidarity withthe workers of Volta Redonda and that five workers were injured inconfrontations with the army.\n.The ICFTU, however, in a letter dated  January , amends itsprevious letter stating that three, not five, workers were killed: Mr.Fernandes Filho and Mr. Freitas Monteiro who were shot, and Mr. Barroso whodied after his skull was broken by blows.\n.The WCOTP, in its letter of  November , denounces the violentintervention by the police (with tear-gas and cavalry charges) on  October\n.In its first reply of  February , the Government furnishes acertain amount of information and observations concerning the allegations madeby the WCOTP concerning the alleged anti-union reprisals against teachers,students and employees of the University of Sao Paulo on  October during a demonstration in respect of pay claims. In this connection theGovernment states that the Regional Delegation for Labour of Sao Paulo, whichit consulted on the matter, had informed it that employees of the universityhad indeed organised a campaign in front of the headquarters of the Governorof the state with a view to obtaining better salaries within the framework ofthe municipal election campaign of . The Government confirms that thepersons concerned held several public demonstrations but claims that none ofthese took place near the Governor's Palace or involved a dispute with thestate military police. The Government states that an investigation is beingcarried out by the competent bodies of the Government of the State of SaoPaulo to determine who was responsible.\n.In another reply, dated  April , concerning allegations by theICFTU in respect of anti-union reprisals against public employees and workersin state enterprises, following a -hour strike in support of pay claims in\n.The Government goes on to explain that the presence of the military inthe Duque de Caxias oil refinery was designed to protect public property andavoid it being damaged and that this helped to ensure that the strike remainedpeaceful.\n.Still according to the Government, the workers who were dismissed atPorto Santos have all been reinstated following negotiations.\n.The Government states that the account given of the events which tookplace at the EMBRAER enterprise is inaccurate. It maintains that on  and August  workers of this enterprise went on strike claiming a  per centwage increase with the support of the Metallurgical Trade Union which hadremained inside the plant on  August when the strikers occupied the works. On\n.As regards the dismissal of the three trade union leaders, BeneditoCarlos de Sousa, Francisco Assis de Souza and Joao Pedro Pires, a judicialinquiry was opened before the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Sao Josdos Campos to determine whether there had been serious misconduct constitutingjust grounds for the dismissal of the said trade union leaders. In the courseof the appeal lodged by the dismissed leaders, the enterprise proposed anagreement, which was ratified. According to this agreement, the leaderssecured the guaranteed maintenance of their rights as though they had not beendismissed on just grounds. This agreement was approved by the regionaltribunal of the second region of Sao Paulo.\n.Thirty-three of the  workers whose dismissal had been approved bythe trade union were reinstated in the enterprise.\n.The Government concludes its statement on this allegation by specifyingthat the strike in question was judged to be illegal by the Sao Paulo LabourCourt as a result of which, at the time, the workers concerned were deemed tohave committed serious misconduct. At the same time, the Government claims, noone was dismissed on unjust grounds.\n.The Government refutes, moreover, the allegations concerning thedismissal of  trade union leaders at Carajs in the State of Par.\n.More generally, the Government specifies, as regards the pay freeze forthe months of April and May  of federal public employees and of workers instate enterprises, that in fact Legislative Decree No.  of  providedfor a . per cent pay increase for August  based on the cost of livingfor April , and that Act No.  of  established . per cent payincreases for November  based on the cost of living for May .\n.As regards the allegations made both by the ICFTU and by the WFTUconcerning the social conflict in November  within the National Iron andSteel Company at Volta Redonda in the State of Rio de Janeiro, the Governmentstates, in a further communication dated  April , that thismixed-economy company is one of the largest iron and steel works in thecountry and that it generates thousands of jobs and is a major source offoreign currency. The Government confirms that on  November  a strikebroke out among the , workers of this enterprise, as stated by the WFTU(not , as stated by the ICFTU). The Government also confirms that thestrikers demanded pay increases and better conditions of work as well as thereinstatement of workers who had been dismissed for having participated in aprevious strike.

A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers\' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union.

Fifteen trade unionists were arrested on that day, including Julio Chang Crespo, Secretary-General of the CEOSL and member of the Executive Committee of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (ORIT), a regional organisation belonging to the ICFTU. The ICFTU states that it supports its affiliate organisation\'s claims for wage increases and the repeal of governmental economic and social measures.\n.Together with its communication of  November , the ICFTU encloses a report from its affiliate, the CEOSL, on the causes which gave rise to the national general strike called by the Ecuadorian trade union movement and the course it took. The CEOSL explains in this document that the Government has carried out a policy aimed at giving a boost to exporters of agricultural products, banks and large undertakings at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises, resulting in the worsening of the social and economic situation of the majority of the population. This policy has brought about, for instance, price increases in stable commodities, public services (transport, electricity, water and telephones) and medicines, the freezing of budgetary expenditure for education and an increase in unemployment and underemployment.\n.According to the CEOSL, the Government systematically infringes Conventions Nos.  and  and the right to strike. For example, it refuses to register trade union executives which have been democratically and legally elected and to approve the rules of new organisations by laying down administrative requirements not stipulated by law. The CEOSL quotes the case of several trade unions who have been confronted with such difficulties (the Ecuadorian Railway Workers Union, the Works\' Council of Cubiertas and Mzov S.A., the Federation of Free Workers in the Ecuadorian Sugar Sector, the Santa Elena Agricultural Workers\' Trade Union).\n.As regards collective bargaining, the CEOSL states that collective agreements are not applied either in the public or in the private sector; bargaining is obstructed and agreements negotiated with public undertakings or bodies are challenged by the Ministry of Finance. In many cases, according to the CEOSL, strikers are subjected to police repression although the strikes have been called in strict conformity with the law.\n.The CEOSL also points out that the Executive does not apply the decisions adopted by the National Congress. For instance, the Government submitted a Bill to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to  US dollars ) accompanied by a tax programme to finance the wage increase. The Congress refused this Bill on the grounds that the increase was derisory. The Executive nevertheless, implemented this Bill, refusing to apply the Congress\'s decision to increase wages by , sucres per month (equivalent to . US dollars).\n.According to the CEOSL, the President of the Republic also approved an Executive Decree restricting the right to call solidarity strikes, which is contrary to Ecuadorian law. This Decree, of which the CEOSL provides a copy, limits solidarity strikes to five days, stipulating that they may not be called upon more than twice in one year by workers in the same undertaking. The CEOSL has lodged an appeal against this Decree with the Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees.\n.In these circumstances, the national trade union confederations called a national strike on  September , in which wide sectors of the economy throughout the country took part. This movement was harshly put down by the police which, according to the CEOSL, arrested about  workers.\n.The CEOSL headquarters were also brutally attacked by the police and the trade unionists inside were dealt blows.\n.In its communications of  and  October , the Government states that Julio Chang Crespo, mentioned in the ICFTU\'s complaint, was arrested on  September  and sentenced to two-days\' imprisonment for breach of the peace and not for having exercised the right to strike, which is legally recognised. The person in question was released on  September and, two days later, left the country to attend a trade union meeting being held in Buenos Aires.\n.The Government adds that strikes linked to industrial disputes are protected by the Ecuadorian legal system but that, on the other hand, collective work stoppages and political strikes are specifically banned by Act No.  adopted by the National Assembly in . Under this Act, a collective work stoppage is defined as being the collective cessation of activity, the imposing of a lock-out outside the cases allowed by law, the paralysis of lines of communication and other similar anti-social occurrences. The instigators and authors of such stoppages are liable to a fine of , to , sucres and to two- to five-years\' imprisonment; those taking part in the work stoppage are liable to a fine of  to , sucres and to three-months\' to one-year\'s imprisonment. In its communications issued before the strike, the Government informed the population that this Act was still fully in force.\n.In the text of the sentence handed down by the Sixth Police Court on the persons arrested on  September , it is stated that those concerned took part in demonstrations not authorised by the police, which disrupted law and order and blocked the public highway, and that they shouted protests against the Government and public officials. In accordance with section , paragraph  of the Penal Code, they were sentenced to two days\' imprisonment.\n.The Government also encloses press cuttings containing statements by the Minister of Labour to the effect that the strike of  September was of a political nature and attempted to destabilise the regime.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government considers that the critisisms levelled by the complainants at the economic and social policy conducted in Ecuador are merely subjective statements of an arbitrary nature and divorced from reality. Admittedly, like many developing countries, Ecuador is undergoing a crisis, but the Government is attempting to ensure that the nation overcomes it unscathed and with the least social and political consequences. It is incumbent upon the public authorities to guarantee peace in the country and uphold national law and order.\n.The Government strongly denies the allegation that, by controlling the seditious actions of  September, it infringed ILO Conventions Nos.  and . It widely respects trade union rights and guarantees the exercise of these rights provided that this is lawful and moral and does not infringe legislation or disrupt law and order. The ""general strike"" of  September, wrongly described as ""peaceful"", was neither of a social nor trade union nature but was a seditious act: groups of rioters set up barricades in the streets and on the highways, caused fires, attacked members of the police force and private and official vehicles, damaged private property and injured individuals. The Government was prudent in the way it controlled the situation. Only several people actually instigating the disturbances or involved in violent action were arrested after being caught in the act. These agitators, who were imprisoned, were immediately released once the disturbances had ended and after serving a very short sentence of two-days\' imprisonment, in accordance with the penalties for offences laid down in the Penal Code. The only reason behind all the international proceedings was therefore to prolong a meticulously organised scandal and to exaggerate the importance of incidents brought rapidly brought under control. According to the Government, even an opposition paper described the general strike as being political. Furthermore, the Government points out that the so-called ""evidence"" of the ""repression"" carried out by the Government consists of cuttings from this same opposition paper.\n.The Government quotes several articles from the National Constitution: article , which lays down the functions and duties of the President of the Republic, including the upholding of national law and order, the use of the police force when security and public services warrant this and the declaration of the national state of emergency; article , which states that the role of the police force is to uphold national sovereignty, defend the integrity and independence of the nation and to guarantee its judicial system. The Government also provides a copy of the provisions of the Penal Code pertaining to offences against national state security. The Government points out that the rights of the individual and of society are protected by Ecuadorian legislation, in particular by Title II of the Constitution, of which it provides a copy.\n.The Government adds that', '.The Committee on Freedom of Association examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see rd Report, paragraphs  to ), which was approved at its th Session (November ).\n.The Government sent additional information on the outstanding allegations in a communication dated  December .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government concerning this case, in particular that Julio Chang Crespo, the trade union officer who is the subject of this complaint, and other trade unionists have been released after serving a sentence of two days\' imprisonment handed down by the trial judge for disseminating false information and rumours concerning the order currently prevailing in Ecuadorian society and for offending national honour. The sentence accords with the provisions of section () of the Ecuadorian Penal Code.\n.The Committee would nevertheless recall the principle that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas and to this end workers, employers and their organisations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. However, the Committee recalls in general terms that in expressing their opinions trade union organisations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language. (See th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para.  and th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. (f).)\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee notes that Julio Chang Crespo and the other trade unionists who are the subject of this complaint have been released after being sentenced to two days\' imprisonment. The Committee further considers that the matter does not call for further examination.\n.In a communication dated  March , the ICFTU submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Ecuador.\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  March , the ICFTU explains that its affiliate organisation in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL), together with other national trade union confederations, called a national strike on  March  to protest against the excessive increase in fuel prices and transport costs. According to the ICFTU, the Government, on the grounds of this national strike, ordered the arrest of the Secretary-General of the CEOSL, Julio Chang and other trade unionists.\n.In its communication of  July , the Government points out that on  and  March , there were three serious earthquakes which affected a large part of the country, resulting in loss of life and property and bringing oil production (the country\'s major trade export) to a halt, as a large stretch of the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline was destroyed; this caused a sudden situation in which the national economy threatened to collapse. The Government, the communication continues, coped with the emergency situation as best it could to ensure that the country could continue functioning in spite of the immediate consequences of the disaster.\n.The Government adds that, in view of the disasterous situation which had occurred and which threatened to paralyse the national economy, it was bound, in fulfilling its obligations to govern, to take some measures to create emergency resources (so to be able to pay the salaries of public servants, amongst other things) and improve the capacity of the remaining system of production. As part of these measures, it was necessary to raise the price of petrol to the equivalent of  American cents or  Swiss centimes per gallon ( litres), i.e.  American cents or  Swiss centimes per litre. Furthermore, it was vital to release foreign currency and float the bank interest rate, because the State was incapable of continuing to subsidise exchange rates and the fixed interest rate.\n.The Government\'s communication adds that confronted with this situation, the ""executive"" of the trade union confederations did not adopt a responsible attitude. Mr. Fausto Dutn, substitute member of the National Congress, representing the Broad Left Front (FADI), took over the presidency of the Workers\' Unitarian Front (FUT) and announced the list of claims of the forthcoming strike which advocated: i)there should be no payment of the foreign debt; (ii) the oil industry should be nationalised; (iii) primary commodities should only be marketed by ENAC and ENPROVIT (state marketing enterprises) in order to maintain a price balance; (iv) land should be handed over to the peasants. Furthermore, it demanded that the Head of State should be put on trial and resign and that the decision to increase fuel prices should be revoked.\n.The Government points out that this case has nothing to do with a ""strike"", because in Ecuadorian labour law a strike means ""a collective suspension of work by employees acting in combination""; a strike is authorised ""if a dispute arises between an employer and his employees"", and this is submitted to the conciliation and arbitration tribunal. It may only be declared in the following cases: ""() if the employer, after being notified of the employees\' demands, fails to reply within the statutory time or gives a negative reply; () if the employer, after being notified, dismisses or gives notice of dismissal to one or more employees, or gives notice of the termination of an agreement ..."", except ""in the case of the dismissal of an employee who has committed an act of violence against the property of the undertaking or factory or against the person of the employer or his agent; () if no conciliation and arbitration tribunal is appointed within the time specified in section  or if, having been appointed, the tribunal for any reason does not meet within three days of its appointment, on condition in either case that the failure is not the fault of the members designated by the employees; () if conciliation proves impossible or no award is issued within the time allowed by section "". Strikes are only guaranteed by the Constitution and the Labour Code subject to these conditions. However, this concept of strike action is so wide that it authorises strikers to remain in the factories, workshops or workplaces concerned (unique in world labour legislation), under police protection against the entry of agitators and strike breakers; it entitles strikers to receive remuneration and authorises solidarity strikes: ""The law also recognises the right to strike where the object is to support a lawful strike declared by the employees of another undertaking."" A lawful general strike might arise because employees in one undertaking support a strike in another undertaking, which is being conducted in accordance with the law, and this spreads to all undertakings throughout the country.\n.But this is not the case here, the Government continues in its communication, because on  March  political leaders of various opposition parties illegally interpreted ""freedom of association"" in their own way. These same political leaders head trade union confederations grouped together in the Workers\' Unitarian Front, whilst also participating in the Ecuadorian Revolutionary Youth Movement, the Workers\' Revolutionary Movement, the General Union of Workers or the Popular Front. Similarly, they collaborate with these real or fictitious organisations, with the FEUE and the UNE and various clandestine groups who are openly committed to violence. These persons, in interpreting freedom of association in their own way, prevented the free movement of vehicles and pedestrians and normal activities within the city by raising obstacles and barricades in the streets, destroying traffic signs, public clocks and rubbish bins and tearing up the paving on the streets.\n.The Government\'s communication also describes the outcome of the above-mentioned strike; in particular, it notes that: citizens and members of the police and their vehicles were stoned; tyres were burnt, in Esmeralda, stores and private houses were stormed and several establishments burnt; in Quito, as a result of the storming of the Hotel Coln Internacional and the Finance Corporation with incendiary bombs, there was a threat of fire in the first floors of the hotel and the windows of both buildings were shattered; the premises of the Employers\' and Workers\' Association of the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources were attacked with incendiary bombs; and in Quito, an incendiary bomb was thrown at a van transporting a group of young conscripts doing their national military service, some of whom suffered injuries and burns. In the capital city, the strikers killed hundreds of dogs, scorching them in the fire and then hanging them from the branches of trees and on lamp-posts. At the end of the day of  March, the strikers declared that the ""tenth general strike"" organised by the FUT had been ""victorious"". Several FUT officials tried,', ""of Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, and to request it once more to indicate the present position of Mr. Julio Ayala Serra;(c) to draw attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  with respect to strikes in the teaching profession and the dissolution of the National Union of Educators (UNE), and to request the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE, which is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Ecuador), and supply information on any development in this connection;(d) to take note of this interim report.\n.The complaints are contained in two communications, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated  July , and the other from the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  July . The CPUSTAL supplied additional information in a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September . On  October  the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions submitted a complaint concerning which the Government has not yet transmitted its observations.\n.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CPUSTAL alleged that the Police Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of non-existent laws, had pronounced judgement sentencing to two years' imprisonment, and fines of from , to , sucres, the President of the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), Juan Vasquez Bastidas, and the President of the National Union of Educators (UNE), Manuel Anton. These organisations are members of the CPUSTAL. The complainants added that these persons had not been given any sort of trial.\n.The WFTU stated that the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL - had organised, on  May , a -hour national strike in support of a claim for higher wages and other demands of an economic and social nature. The UNE, which has a membership of , teachers, called a work stoppage on the same day with a view to obtaining a salary rise and an increase in the national education budget. In response, added the WFTU, the Government issued a decree, No. , conferring upon police intendants the status of special judges competent to try trade union officials and strikers under an expeditious procedure with no right of appeal. At the same time the Government instructed these police intendants to bring to trial the principal leaders of the three Confederations that had organised the national strike of  May, as well as officials of the UNE.\n.Furthermore, continued the complainants, the Supreme Council of Government issued on  May  a decree outlawing the UNE and providing for the custodianship of its funds. At the end of June, the General Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of the aforementioned Decree No. , sentenced Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton to fines and imprisonment. The WFTU further mentioned the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guays who was to be tried under the same procedure.\n.The Government, in a detailed reply to which were appended a large number of documents, emphasised that it was its policy to encourage the trade union movement in Ecuador. As evidence of this it pointed to the subsidy of , sucres that it paid to the country's trade union Confederations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, to cover the expenses of the  May rally. However, it continued, the leaders of these three Confederations had taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by this event - in which the majority of the participants had no connection with the trade union movement - to incite the workers to take part in a national work stoppage on  May , based on a combat manifesto of nine points, not all of which related to industrial matters, and which were refuted one by one. Moreover, none of these demands had been put to the competent authorities through the proper legal channels.\n.In the appendices to the Government's reply there was a list of these points and the arguments whereby the Government refuted them. These demands were as follows:\n.The Government stated that the union leaders were allowed to prepare for the work stoppage in full freedom. They had access to the radio, television and the press at the national level. The Government further pointed out that it had recognised the workers' organisations without reservations. However, it could not fail in its moral and legal duty to preserve public order and ensure that citizens could live their lives normally in every respect. It could only condemn incitement to disorderly conduct and anarchy, whoever was responsible, and any attempt to undermine the functioning of the State by disregarding the procedures in force for dealing with all grievances, individual or collective. In substance, the Government enforced the regulations in force to defend its stability and ensure the preservation of public order and the safety of persons and property. It was these duties that the Government was performing in dealing with the events of  May .\n.The Government refuted the complainants' allegations completely. It claimed that these complaints were unfounded and did not mention a single specific case of infringement of the freedom of association Conventions. All persons living on the territory of a State, added the Government, were required to observe the laws of that country. Under Legislative Decree No.  of  June , the instigators of a collective stoppage of work, and the ringleaders of such a stoppage, were liable to a fine of from , to , sucres and from two to five years' imprisonment. Persons who participated in such a work stoppage without having instigated it or being a ringleader were liable to a fine of from  to , sucres and from three months' to one year's imprisonment. A work stoppage within the meaning of this legislative decree was deemed to occur where there was a collective cessation of activity, where establishments were forcibly closed other than in the circumstances provided for by law, and in the event of paralysis of channels of communication or other anti social acts. These provisions had the force of a special Act and had precedence over those of general Acts which were contrary to them.\n.The strike of  May , continued the Government, had been prepared, inter alia, by Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Emilio Velasco and Jos Chvez Chvez, officials of one or other of the workers' associations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, while other unions (bearing the same initials) had refused to be associated with the stoppage and had condemned it as an act of treason by the rank and file, requesting the support of the authorities to enable them to carry on with their daily work. The above-mentioned persons, in instigating the strike, had contravened Legislative Decree No .\n.This Legislative Decree, added the Government, was supplemented by Presidential Decree No. , which specified the competent judicial authority and guarantees the rights of defendants. There accordingly existed a judicial institution, established by the State, to mete out punishment in the case of work stoppages and strikes organised unlawfully. The Government appended the text of this decree, adopted on  May . Section  confers upon general police intendants the status of special judges competent to deal with and pronounce judgement upon offences in connection with collective work stoppages; they must impose the penalties prescribed in Legislative Decree No. . Section  states that the procedure is to be that prescribed in section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure; sections , ,  and  of that Code are likewise to be observed. Section  specifies that special judges may, either on their own initiative or at the request of any administrative or judicial authority, take up a case and try the persons held to be criminally responsible for a collective work stoppage.\n.The judgements handed down in respect of Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, concluded the Government, had been pronounced in accordance with the legal rules in force in the country and the penalties had been imposed by the legally competent authority. There could, therefore, be no question as to the validity of their conviction.\n.This case is mainly concerned with the general strike called on  May  by the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL and another strike organised on the same day by the UNE. This work stoppage resulted in the sentencing, under an emergency procedure, of trade union leaders including Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton. The complainants also mention the arrest of another trade union leader, Julio Ayala Serra, and the outlawing of the UNE, but the Government has made no observations on the latter two points.\n.As already pointed out by the Committee, Article  of Convention No.  recognises the right of trade union organisations""]"

Workers belonging to ASPA enjoy the same rights as members of STIAS, even though they are not part of the latter union, which holds the signing rights for the collective labour agreement (article  of the Federal Labour Law).\n.The Government states that ASPA applied to AVIACSA and STIAS for the right to sign the collective labour agreement on behalf of pilots on  March . The case was turned over to Special Council No.  of the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration under case No. IV-/. The application by the Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic was later added, since it sought the right to sign the same collective labour agreement.\n.The Council ordered a trial ballot among the entire AVIACSA workforce. It was held on  August . ASPA received no votes.\n.It is emphasized that  workers voted, including  pilots of the total of  pilots actively working for AVIACSA.\n.The collective labour agreement concluded with STIAS covers all labour issues affecting the AVIACSA workforce. While article , Section III of the Federal Labour Law provides for the hypothetical occurrence of competition between occupational and enterprise or industrial trade unions, the hypothesis is not applicable where there is an existing agreement covering all labour relations.\n.The Council pronounced final judgement on  October  to the effect that ASPA s case was dismissed and the defence of AVIACSA and STIAS was upheld. The respondents were absolved of all of the claims by ASPA and the Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic. ASPA applied for leave to appeal against the final judgement to the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Labour of the First Circuit and was granted leave to appeal in order first to resolve the dispute surrounding the trial ballots proposed by the parties before such a ballot be conducted. The dispute centres around the fact that AVIACSA and STIAS propose to ballot the entire AVIACSA workforce, while ASPA would ballot only the pilots. The Council fulfilled the appeal judgement through an agreement dated  May  in which it settled the dispute surrounding the ballot. After analysing the evidence put forward by the parties, the Council decided that, since a collective labour agreement was already registered with an industrial trade union and covered all the company s workforce, that existing collective agreement regulated all labour relations in the relevant company under the terms of article  of the Federal Labour Law. The Council also considers that, while article , section III of the Federal Labour Law provides for the hypothetical occurrence of competition between occupational and enterprise or industrial trade unions in the conclusion of a collective labour agreement, where, as in this case, there is an existing agreement covering all labour relations, it is essential to ballot all workers and not only the members of the pilots\' trade union. Failure to follow this procedure would be a violation of the rights not only of the members of STIAS, which concluded the collective labour agreement, but of those of every worker in the service of AVIACSA. The Council also noted that the ballot was undoubtedly the ideal test of which organization should be accredited to conclude and administer the collective labour agreement, for which the successful union would need to demonstrate that it had the majority support both of the trade union members and of the remaining workers at the company.\n.The Council announced a new date,  June , for the balloting of all workers. ASPA did not obtain any votes in the ballot. STIAS obtained  votes and the Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic obtained one vote.\n.As regards the five claims of unfair dismissal, the Government states that they were submitted to the labour authorities by Emilio Zrate Gonzlez, Ari Rafael Rose Errejn, Mario Rafael Escalera Crdenas, Marcos Guillermo Mendoza Escobar and Gerardo Serrato Sala and are still being examined by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, and therefore it has not yet been established whether they were dismissed unjustly or whether the reason was their trade union activities.\n.As regards ASPA s claim that the High Court of Justice declared illegal the rule set by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, namely that the right to sign a collective agreement could not be claimed on behalf of a specific occupational group, but only on behalf of all categories covered under the agreement, the Government states that the collegiate tribunals of the labour circuit that deal with appeals against final rulings by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration are not qualified to ""declare illegal the rules"" of the Council. Their competence extends to upholding or rejecting the complainant s appeal against specific acts of authority that are perceived to violate his individual constitutional rights. The rulings of appeal cases refer only to the individuals that brought the case and are limited to providing them with recourse and protection, if appropriate, in the specific circumstances that motivated the appeal, without making a general declaration concerning the law or act that gave rise to it (article  of the Law on Recourse, regulating articles  and  of the Constitution of the United Mexican States). Contrary to ASPA s claim, the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration upheld the rule that all the workers at the company and to whom the collective labour agreement applied should be balloted. It is not sufficient for the union to gain the majority of votes from a single occupational group; it must take into account the votes of all workers covered by the collective labour agreement. The Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration has applied this rule in the airline industry and to all similar cases brought by occupational trade unions to obtain the right to sign collective labour agreements.\n.The Government emphasizes that there is no legal substance to the arguments that: (a) the collective agreement is breaking up of its own accord because each of the occupations to which it applies is governed by its own specific standards; (b) a collective agreement should be considered for each individual occupation; and (c) the AVIACSA collective agreement should be divided into three sections for the different occupations that it covers, each with its own field of application. As regards the argument that the AVIACSA pilots are not covered by the general provisions of the Federal Labour Law and enjoy special working conditions because they are governed by standards applicable exclusively to their profession, the Federal Labour Law establishes the working conditions for all workers, including pilots, and its Chapter IV lays down special provisions for the ""work of air crew"". Pilots are governed by the provisions of Chapter IV and the general provisions of the Federal Labour Law.\n.Finally, the Government states that, during the legal dispute over the right to sign the AVIACSA collective labour agreement, ASPA has been able to exercise its rights under the law and have recourse to remedies against the resolutions by which it considered itself affected. The issue that has been brought before the ILO is still sub judice before the national judicial bodies and this could affect the process before the Mexican courts pronounce. Moreover, if the federal legal authorities uphold ASPA s case, this communication will be groundless.\n.To conclude, the Government has acted in accordance with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining established by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO in the sphere of exclusive bargaining rights:- There is an objective and previously established criterion, the balloting procedure contained in article  of the Federal Labour Law, to determine the right to sign the collective labour agreement.- Special Council No. , respecting the principle of ""the most representative organization"" contained in article , paragraph , of the ILO Constitution, ordered a ballot among the entire AVIACSA workforce to determine which trade union had the right to sign the collective labour agreement.- The balloting procedure was carried out before Special Council No. , which is an independent body, with tripartite membership.- ASPA freely exercised its right to seek the right to sign the collective labour agreement.- STIAS obtained the majority of the votes in the two ballots:  votes in the first and  in the second. The Trade Union of Labourers and Employees in Transport, Communications and Similar Industries of the Mexican Republic obtained one vote each time and the Trade Union Association of Airline Pilots of Mexico (ASPA) received no votes. Hence, the most representative trade union was selected on the basis of the vote of the majority of the workers in the', "".At its meeting in November , the Committee formulated conclusions on an allegation that had remained pending in relation to this case and refers to the dismissal of members of ASPA. The complainant (ASPA) had alleged in June  that, following ASPA s decision to demand a collective agreement for AVIACSA pilots, a number of pilots had been unfairly dismissed only because they supported ASPA, including Captain Emilio Alberto Zrate Gonzlez, Captain Andrs Flores Lpez, Captain Gerardo Gorra Carmona, Captain Ismael Cruz Romn, Captain Marcos Guillermo Mendoza Escobar, Captain Luis Fernando del Ro Leal, Captain Manuel Tostado Almazn, Captain Jos Eduardo Rodrguez Normanda, Captain Gerardo Serrato Sala, Captain Jorge Eduardo Moreno Aguirre, Captain Ari Rafael Rose Errejn and Captain Mario Rafael Escalera Crdenas. As a consequence of the unfair dismissals, individual appeals against dismissal were lodged and are being processed by Special Council No.  of the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration under case numbers /, /, /, / and / [see the Committee s th Report, para. ]. In June , ASPA alleged that the company again dismissed more pilots between April and May  for voting in favour of ASPA at the most recent ballot on  March  [see the th Report, para. ]. At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see the th Report, para. ]:As regards the dismissals of the ASPA members referred to by the Committee in its previous examination of the case, the Committee observes that the judicial proceedings are still pending. The Committee requests the Government to take the appropriate measures to ensure that those proceedings are concluded as quickly as possible and, if the anti-union nature thereof is proven, that the dismissed workers are reinstated immediately, without loss of pay. In addition, the Committee notes with concern the allegations relating to the dismissal of new workers for voting in favour of the ASPA trade union organization. The Committee notes the high number of dismissals in the context of a collective bargaining dispute and that the Government merely points out the existence of the possibility of taking legal action. The Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the relevant inquiries are conducted immediately and, if the anti-union nature of these latest dismissals is proven, to consider the possibility of ensuring the reinstatement of these workers as soon as possible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government supplied information on the status of the cases relating to the  individuals named by the complainants that are currently being examined by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration (a jurisdictional body) and have not yet been concluded. The Government states that it is this Council that will have to rule on whether the workers were dismissed unjustifiably for their trade union activities. In its communication dated  February , the Government requests the complainant to indicate the court and the number of the file of any other cases of dismissal that have not been resolved.\n.Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of all of the cases relating to dismissals and hopes that judicial rulings will be handed down in the near future.\n.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the rulings issued in the proceedings initiated by a group of workers who had been dismissed for supporting the application by ASPA to conclude a collective labour agreement and, if it transpired that the dismissals had been due to legitimate trade union activity, to ensure that the workers concerned were reinstated in their posts, without loss of pay.\n.In a communication dated  June , the Trade Union Association of Airline Pilots of Mexico (ASPA) stated that the Consorcio Aviaxsa S.A. de C.V. (AVIACSA) company was continuing to disregard the right of airline pilots to negotiate collectively. It emphasizes that originally the collective agreement signed between the company and the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS) did not include airline pilots and that they were subsequently included without being consulted. The complainant organization reiterates that it enjoys a majority of votes from the pilots and as such it was appropriate for it to negotiate collectively, in accordance with the provisions of articles  and  of the Federal Labour Law. The complainant organization adds that, with a view to deciding definitively who enjoyed the majority, the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration ordered, on  February , that a new ballot should be held involving only the AVIACSA pilots. That ballot took place on  March . On that occasion, of  pilots who participated,  voted for ASPA and  for STIAS, but in the course of the ballot, the ballot list from Tijuana was stolen, and this was reported to the Attorney-General s Office of the Republic. Consequently, the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration ordered that the pilots who participated in the ballot in Tijuana should attend a hearing on  April  in order to confirm their votes. On that occasion, the complainant organization reports that various individuals hired by AVIACSA assaulted the members of ASPA, and this was reported to the criminal court.\n.In addition, the complainant organization alleges that the collective labour agreement between Consorcio Aviaxsa S.A. de C.V. (AVIACSA) and STIAS contains various clauses which violate the freedom of association. Clause  of the agreement states that if all or some of the workers of a particular speciality separate from or leave the union, they will be replaced by workers who are members of the union.\n.Finally, the complainant organization states that the company again dismissed more pilots in April and May  for voting in favour of ASPA at the last ballot on  March .\n.In a communication dated  September , the Government states that, in its last examination of the case, the Committee determined that, since the Government of Mexico had demonstrated that the most representative trade union in the AVIACSA company was the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS) (which signed the collective agreement in force), it does not appear that the principles of collective bargaining were violated by denying ASPA the right to negotiate a specific collective agreement for the pilots' group. The Committee emphasized that the system of collective bargaining with exclusive rights for the most representative trade union is compatible with the principle of freedom of association. This is a matter to be decided on the basis of national law and practice.\n.With respect to the contents of the collective labour agreement concluded between AVIACSA and the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS), the Government of Mexico states that it unfailingly respects the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, in accordance with articles  to  of the Federal Labour Law.\n.Such collective agreements must also cover the minimum labour standards laid down in section XXVII of article , paragraph A of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States and article  of the Federal Labour Law states that under no circumstances shall conditions of labour be inferior to those laid down in that law and shall be proportionate to the importance of the services in question and shall be the same for the same kinds of work.\n.The Government adds that, in any case, any worker who considers his rights to be violated, is entitled to take action to assert them according to the terms of the Federal Labour Law itself.\n.With regard to ASPA s assertion that it is incorrect that the ballots were general with the participation of the entire AVIACSA workforce, the Government points out that, since it demonstrated that a trade union with greater representativity existed in the AVIACSA company, it did not appear that the principles of collective bargaining had been violated by denying ASPA the right to negotiate a specific agreement for the pilots' group. In addition, the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Labour of the First Circuit, in the appeal brought by ASPA in case No. DT./, ordered solely the AVIACSA pilots to be balloted, making the previous ballot null and void. The Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, pursuant to the ruling of the Collegiate Tribunal, was obliged to comply and complied in full with the order, holding a new ballot on  March  exclusively for the pilots. The Collegiate Tribunal, in granting ASPA the right to appeal, did not rule on the substance of the problem. In no"", 'as No. IV-/. At the hearing, ASPA confirmed its request and evidence, indicating the issues that needed to be addressed and stating the justification for a ballot to be held among the pilots alone, pointing to similar cases, such as those of AEROCANCUN, SARO and AEROMEXPRESS. The respondents, for their part, contested the application and produced their own evidence; they argued that the ballot should include all of the company s workers. They also stated that ASPA did not have the authority to take over from an industrial trade union the collective agreement for an occupational group when the collective labour agreement was indivisible. ASPA s application was accompanied by another, submitted by a different trade union and processed as No. IV-/. On  August , the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration issued a ruling that the trial ballot should be held on  August  and cover the entire AVIACSA workforce, including pilots, cabin crew, mechanics and other ground crew and rejecting ASPA s proposal for an occupational ballot for pilots only. Given the illegal nature of such a company-wide ballot and the impossibility of winning (even if the majority of pilots voted for ASPA it would lose the case because it would not have the overall majority of votes, and if the majority of the company s workforce voted for ASPA it would also lose, because it only covers pilots and cannot offer membership to other categories). ASPA decided not to support the ballot and instructed pilots not to vote, or, if they did, to give their vote to another union in order to avoid being dismissed unjustly.\n.It adds that, following ASPA s decision to apply for a collective agreement for pilots at AVIACSA, a number of pilots had been unfairly dismissed purely because they supported ASPA, including Captain Emilio Alberto Zrate Gonzlez, Captain Andrs Flores Lpez, Captain Gerardo Gorra Carmona, Captain Ismael Cruz Romn, Captain Marcos Guillermo Mendoza Escobar, Captain Luis Fernando del Ro Leal, Captain Manuel Tostado Almazn, Captain Jos Eduardo Rodrguez Normanda, Captain Gerardo Serrato Sala, Captain Jorge Eduardo Moreno Aguirre, Captain Ari Rafael Rose Errejn and Captain Mario Rafael Escalera Crdenas. As a consequence of the unfair dismissals, individual appeals against dismissal were lodged and are being processed by Special Council No.  of the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration under case numbers /, /, /, / and /.\n.The complainant states that, on  October , the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration absolved the respondents of ASPA s demand to be allowed to conclude a collective agreement, ruling that it was not appropriate for the pilots of AVIACSA to have their own collective agreement. ASPA disagreed and launched an appeal, which was upheld by the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Labour of the First Circuit in document DT /. In granting the appeal and the protection of federal justice on  May , it ordered the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration not to execute the ruling of  October  and to disregard the results of the ballot held on  August . It ruled that a new ballot should be held because of the illegality of the ballot for the entire AVIACSA workforce. Article  of the Federal Labour Law provides that, in the conclusion of collective labour agreements within a company, there may be both an industrial and an occupational trade union involved and that a collective agreement should be signed with the occupational trade union for its members and with the other trade union for the remaining categories of workers. Article , for its part, stipulates that the loss of the majority referred to in article  entails the loss of the collective labour agreement. The provisions of article  read as follows:Article . ... III. If occupational and enterprise or industrial trade unions are competing, the occupational trade unions shall be allowed to conclude a collective agreement for their occupational group, as long as the number of their members is greater than that of workers in the same occupational group holding membership of the enterprise or industrial trade union.\n.Article  provides that:The loss of the majority referred to by the previous article, as declared by the Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, entails the loss of the collective labour agreement.The Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration applied the principles contained in articles  and  of the Federal Labour Law and it was hence taken that, where conflicts over the right to sign the collective agreement arose because an occupational trade union wished to take over from an industrial union the professional representation of a given category, it was appropriate to take action. In recognition of the greater professional interest of the occupational trade union, it was decided to hold an occupational ballot in which only the members of the disputed category would participate. That rule had been applied by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration in all such conflicts over the right to sign in the airline industry, where, because of the industry s special nature, workers were organized in occupational unions on the basis of a natural division of activities.\n.The complainant states that the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration suddenly amended its rules for the airline industry. In order to protect the unions favoured by the employers and the employers themselves, and since the current collective agreements were of a company-wide nature, it adopted a new rule, namely that the right to sign a collective agreement could not be claimed on behalf of a specific occupational group, but only on behalf of all categories covered under the agreement, which left the occupational trade unions without any rights at all. However, this rule, put forward by the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration, was declared illegal by the High Court of Justice, which ruled that it was appropriate for an occupational trade union to claim from an industrial trade union the right to sign the collective agreement on behalf of a specific occupational group and that the trial ballot should be held only among the workers in that category.\n.Despite the fact that ASPA s appeal was upheld and it was deemed illegal to hold a company-wide ballot on a conflict over the right to sign on behalf of only one occupational group, on  May  the Federal Council for Conciliation and Arbitration once again ordered a general ballot, to be held on  June , dismissing ASPA s representations to the effect that an occupational ballot should be held for pilots only.\n.In every country, airline-industry workers are organized into occupational trade unions corresponding to the different occupational groups, namely ground crew, cabin crew and pilots. This is the general rule because each of these occupations has its own features, on the basis of which its workers have sought to organize their own unions, and the respective unions are affiliated to international federations for each of the relevant occupations. In the case of pilots, both in the Americas and in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Pacific Rim, there are occupational unions, which in turn belong to supra-national organizations of a regional or global nature, such as the OIP or IFALPA.\n.In its communications dated  October  and  March , the Government states that, according to the Trade Union Association of Airline Pilots of Mexico (ASPA), the alleged violation took place during the legal case over the right to sign the collective agreement, brought against Consorcio Aviaxsa, S.A. de C.V. (AVIACSA) and the Trade Union of Workers in Aeronautics, Similar and Related Industries of the Mexican Republic (STIAS).\n.It adds that the events related by ASPA took place during the legal dispute over the right to sign a collective agreement, and, as such, fall under the provisions governing collective bargaining rights contained in the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which has not been ratified by Mexico.\n.In connection with the dispute, the Government states that on  March  AVIACSA concluded a collective labour agreement with STIAS in order to regulate worker-employer relations, which, according to the agreement, should be conducted through a trade union. The clauses of the contract were applicable to all AVIACSA workers. The only distinction drawn among workers was the basic salary payable to each category. The latest version of the salary scale contained  different post types.\n.The Government adds that, on  March , an agreement was concluded on the revision of the salaries contained in the collective labour agreement between AVIACSA and STIAS. This established the categories of ground crew and air crew and laid down different working conditions for each category. The only reference to grades of workers is in the scale of minimum salaries payable according to post, which includes different types of pilots.\n.The collective labour agreement between AVIACSA and STIAS and the salary revision agreement were not divided into occupations. The salary revision agreement drew a distinction between ground crew and air crew in order to be able to provide benefits over and']"

It recalls that it sent a representative to the May  meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments. The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before the Committee.\n.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.\n.The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the interested parties; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life of the country.(b) The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned; it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union situation.\n.When the Committee examined these cases at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations which were pending:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has transmitted to the judicial authorities the Committee's request that measures be taken to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Cases Rodrguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt, in respect of whom it wished to be kept informed of any action taken) and that it has also expressed the hope that this request will be heeded.

The traditional practice in Uruguay has been to submit bilaterally negotiated collective agreements for ""confirmation"" by the wage councils, turning them into decisions to make them generally applicable. The very structure and independence of these bodies favoured this practice, which thus allowed a unique development of independence of the parties even within a tripartite framework. This was clearly shown by the proliferation of collective agreements approved in this way in the s. To a certain extent the expectations raised by the reopening of the wage councils in  went in this direction, as was confirmed by the practice followed in many of the councils. The Government, however, in violation of its obligations as laid down in international standards, has taken it upon itself to obstruct, make difficult and even prevent the development of negotiation between the social partners. At first it brought pressure to bear through its delegates in the wage councils so that agreements between employers and workers would conform to its guide-lines; it then refused to retain in its decrees the wage clauses which did not follow these guide-lines (as the ILO mission was able to observe (see its report, page )); lastly, it went as far as to refuse to recognise the validity of the ""medium- and long-term agreements"" which had not been confirmed by the Executive. (Decrees Nos. / and / prescribe as a condition for the validity of wage clauses in agreements drawn up in the wage councils, that the latter ""be confirmed by decree of the Executive Power"".) The Minister of the Economy himself stated before the Committee on Labour Affairs of the Senate of the Republic that ""obviously, the conditions laid down by the Executive Power shall be taken into account in deciding which agreements it is willing to confirm"".\n.The PIT-CNT adds that despite the express opposition of the trade union movement, section  of Legislative Decree No.  adopted during the dictatorship is still in force. This section provides that ""the Executive Power, jointly with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and, where appropriate, with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, may, if it considers it necessary and appropriate: ... (e) issue rules respecting wages and, in particular, establish occupational categories and regulate the remuneration of workers employed in the private sector"". These extensive powers assigned to the Executive run counter to the system of wage councils and to collective bargaining. The use of such powers to supplant the will of the parties to labour relations constitutes a practice in violation of Conventions Nos.  and , as it restricts the freedom of association and independence of the parties which these Conventions guarantee. Despite this, the Uruguayan Government has thus made increasing use of Legislative Decree No. , in blatant violation of international and national legislation, bringing unlawful pressure to bear on the entire system of collective labour relations and ensuring that it has the last word in fixing wages according to its own unilateral decisions of economic policy. A complete picture of this policy emerges from the decrees issued in February of the years ,  and  (/, / and /) by which general wage increases were fixed directly by the Executive without convening the wage councils and without taking any account of the opinions of the sides of industry. The Minister of the Economy has made the following statement: ""the Executive Power,"" said the highest exponent of the economic policy, ""apart from refusing to confirm some agreements, has not taken any measures beyond this, except for the periodical decision, adopted out of considerations of timeliness and appropriateness, to fix remuneration by decree. Obviously, the Executive Power does not renounce this machinery.""\n.As regards collective bargaining in the public administration, the PIT-CNT alleges that the Uruguayan Government prevents the development of collective bargaining in the public administration, whether in the central administration or in autonomous bodies and decentralised services. This is a failure to comply with Convention No. , which allows only public servants engaged in the administration of the State to be excluded from its scope. The Government has attempted to conceal its violation of international standards in this field by agreeing to meet with trade union organisations of public servants both of the central administration and of the autonomous bodies and services. However, the methods used have merely confirmed its ignorance of such standards in addition to violating the Constitution of the Republic itself. Thus, at the level of the central administration, the Government was represented by the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of the Economy and the Planning and Budget Office, which generally confined themselves to stating their own wage guide-lines. The complainant affirms categorically that this has nothing to do with genuine collective bargaining. Still worse is the situation in the autonomous bodies and decentralised services, because in this respect the Uruguayan Government has not only violated international standards but has also disregarded the independence of such bodies, enshrined in the Constitution, by refusing on several occasions to comply with the agreements reached between the directorates of these bodies and trade union organisations.\n.Starting from the beginning of June  the situation has worsened, if possible, in the public administration, both in the central administration and in the decentralised services and autonomous bodies. Thus, not even the sham negotiations which formerly took place have been opened. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that  June  was the deadline, the last time until , for drawing up the budget accounts, since no adjustments may be made in  which is an election year. This means that nearly half of all Uruguayan workers are not only prevented from participating in determining their wages, but also run the risk that for virtually two years they will have to submit to what the Government decides itself, in blatant violation of international Conventions and the most elementary democratic standards.\n.The PIT-CNT alleges further that on  December  the Puma Trading SA enterprise, which employs  workers, dismissed Messrs. Carlos Bez and Williams Maciel, members of the executive committee of the Trade Union of Manual and Office Workers of Puma (SOEP) in violation of the provisions of Convention No. . In support of its allegation, the PIT-CNT highlights the following indications of the anti-union nature of the dismissals: () in , labour-management relations became extremely difficult, being constantly obstructed by the employer; () the trade union leaders concerned were on the list of candidates for union elections which were to take place four days after the dismissal; () the dismissal cited ""grounds of improving the service"" as the persons involved ""failed to meet the general requirements of the enterprise""; () hearings held in the Ministry of Labour established the impossibility of technically justifying the grounds cited by the employer; () the work records of the persons dismissed were excellent, since they had met all the requirements for admission to the enterprise and for employment in an occupational category involving considerable responsibility; () the enterprise did not give any explanation of the reason it had chosen this particular time to carry out the dismissal.\n.The PIT-CNT emphasises that Uruguayan legislation still includes provisions which allow free dismissal of workers without giving reasons, on the sole condition that the statutory compensation is paid; the system of small fines imposed by the Ministry of Labour or the Labour Inspectorate (Decree No.  of  February ) in the event of acts of anti-union discrimination is absolutely inadequate, given the reality of the Uruguayan trade union movement. In this particular case, the National Labour Directorate was manifestly ineffective, with the result that the conflict was aggravated; the mediating officials refrained from acting and left it to the parties to settle the dispute.\n.Lastly, the PIT-CNT alleges that in the second half of , the ""Sociedad Annima Cristaleras del Uruguay"", which employs about  workers, introduced changes in its machinery. According to the trade union, this new machinery involved technological changes, which meant that the collective agreement in force since  and registered with the Ministry of Labour and which had been concluded between the parties and governed this important subject, should have been applied. The trade union organisation demanded that the Ministry ensure compliance with this agreement. Industrial action was also taken, consisting, inter alia, in the exercise of the right to strike with partial and total stoppages in the enterprise. At a time when both parties were willing to negotiate, the trade union decided to cease one of the stoppages, and the enterprise took this opportunity of accusing Messrs. Carlos Chemino (treasurer of the Workers\' Union of Cristaleras del Uruguay) and Anbal Lpez (shop steward) of flagrant misconduct, and dismissed them in September  in violation of Convention No. . The dismissal of these leaders was clearly motivated by anti-union aims, on the pretext of misconduct which had not']"

Moreover, with respect to the  election of the executive committee which was later recognised by the authorities, the Committee had implicitly considered that acts of interference contrary to the principles of Convention No.  had been committed (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ).\n.With respect to the  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government from which it concludes that a number of the teachers mentioned by the complainant organisation were teaching in State schools, and that the rest had given up teaching to take up other non-teaching jobs or activities of a political nature, or for legally sanctionable reasons not connected with the above-mentioned strike were not employed in the service. The Committee observes that the executive committee of COLPROSUMAH which was not recognised by the authorities told the mission that the problem of the dismissed teachers had not been resolved: one of the persons interviewed by the mission (Mr. Marcelino Borjas) said that he was still dismissed and that others were teaching in private schools.\n.Since the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook, during the mission, to send the ILO a precise account of the position of the persons dismissed, the Committee adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of this information.\n.Regarding the arrest of Mr. Ambrosio Sabio (ex-President of COLPROSUMAH), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the proceedings that began in  against Mr. Sabio for the offences of forging private documents, usurpation of functions and persistent embezzlement of COLPROSUMAH, are at the indictment stage. The Committee also notes that according to the Government Mr. Sabio was arrested on  December  and provisionally released on  January , certain proceedings having been declared invalid and there being insufficient grounds for the issue of a warrant of arrest.\n.The Committee also notes the statement made by Mr. Sabio to the mission, particularly the fact that the accusation against him dates from  and that already then the First Criminal Court found no grounds for his arrest. He was arrested some days after the regular congress of COLPROSUMAH which had been convened by the unrecognised board on  December . Since  four judges have been dealing with the matter without issuing a warrant of arrest for lack of grounds. Inexplicably, in the course of a very short substitution in December , the warrant was issued by a judge, who, in total disregard for legality, certified that in November  the officially recognised executive committee of COLPROSUMAH had been properly elected.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee, noting that Mr. Sabio was released  days after his arrest since there were no grounds for his imprisonment, concludes that the measures taken to deprive Mr. Sabio of his freedom were of an anti-union nature. The Committee deplores Mr. Sabio's imprisonment and at the same time draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or their activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .\n.The Committee had requested the Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried out concerning the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Mr. Rolando Vindel Gonzlez (see th Report, Case No. , para. ) and Mr. Gustavo Morales (see st Report, Case No. , para. ).\n.The Committee notes that, as mentioned in the mission report, the investigations are continuing, but that as yet the whereabouts of the leaders are still not known. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the length of time that has elapsed since the disappearance of these leaders, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the investigations being carried out to discover their whereabouts.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  January  in Honduras. The Committee notes with interest that the representative of the Director-General received every facility from the authorities of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in carrying out the mission.b) With respect to the murder of a leader of ANACH, the murder of four leaders of SITRACOAGS and the attempted murder of three leaders of that organisation, the Committee observes that trials are under way and that two of the alleged perpetrators have been identified although they are fugitives from justice. The Committee expresses the hope that the trials under way will be concluded as soon as possible and that they will enable the guilty parties to be punished; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the final results.c) As regards  teachers who are still dismissed because of the  strike, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government but adjourns examination of this allegation pending receipt of information on the present position of the dismissed teachers which, during the direct contacts mission, the unrecognised COLPROSUMAH executive committee undertook to send.d) Concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders who have now been released (Mr. Jos Manuel Guerrero and Mr. Ambrosio Sabio), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their functions or activities as such are contrary to the principles of Convention No. .e) The Committee expresses its concern at the long period that has elapsed since the disappearance of the trade union leaders Messrs. Roldando Vindel and Gustavo Morales, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the investigations under way to ascertain their whereabouts.\n.The complaint of the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession was presented in a communication dated  March . At its meeting in February  the Committee, having noted that despite several requests the Government had still not sent the information and observations requested from it appealed to it to supply its observations as a matter of urgency. The Committee also drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the rule of procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, the Committee could submit a report on the substance of the matter even if the Government's observations had not been received by its next session (th Report of the Committee, para. ). Since then the Government has still not furnished information or observations on the matter.\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.) .\n.The complaint of violation of freedom of association is lodged against the Government of Honduras by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) on behalf of its affiliate, the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH). According to the WCOTP, the Government has interfered with the right of organisations to draw up their rules and to elect their representatives by adopting legislative measures, and with the right of the most representative organisation to elect its representatives to advisory bodies by withdrawing this right of representation from genuine representatives of the teaching personnel of Honduras and giving it to a dissident group set up with the support of the Government and of the police and military.\n.The WCOTP explains that on  September  the Government adopted Legislative Decree No. - to promulgate an Act respecting the Professional College for the Advancement of Teaching in Honduras (COLPROSUMAH) , repealing the previous Act of  December  on the matter. The new Act was published in the Official Gazette on  October . It was prepared without the participation of this trade union organisation and, in drafting it, Parliament established new standards for the election of the executive committee of the organisation stipulating that trade union leaders may not be re-elected until two two-year periods had elapsed (sections  and  of the Act). According to the WCOTP, this text was adopted with a view to prejudicing the trade union executive of the COLPROSUMAH and in order to favour a group of teachers who have taken over the organisation with the support of the Government.\n.The WCOTP states that the adoption of this legislation and the change of trade union representatives on the various advisory bodies must be seen against the background of the events"", "" July , presented further allegations (Case No. ). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated  May  and in letters dated  and  August .\n.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of  July  provides a list of  trade unionists and  professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.\n.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.\n.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the  agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,\n.In its letters of  May , the Government indicates that of the  agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL,  had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in , and were set free by the courts in April and May  because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.\n.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.\n.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.\n.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.\n.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.\n.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.\n.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.\n.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on  of the  persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of  agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released  of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report.\n.By communications dated  and  March and  April  respectively, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented allegations of violations of trade union rights in Honduras.

Case No.  refers essentially to the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , No. , and more precisely to the th final supplementary provision which, according to the allegations of the complainant organizations, the FTLF and the CGTP, prohibits wage increases for workers through collective bargaining. The above provision states, inter alia, that negotiation or labour arbitration proceedings may contain only working conditions; that arbitration resolutions, agreements or awards which ignore said prohibition will be null and void ipso jure, and that arbitrators who fail to implement that provision will no longer be entitled to participate in public sector collective bargaining arbitration processes.\n.According to the complainant organization, the FTLF, and as confirmed by the Government, FONAFE must comply with the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year  and, as a result, state electrical companies in FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The complainant organization also alleges that FONAFE establishes wage ceilings for state electrical companies that comply with the budget assigned for state companies, limiting the possibilities of negotiating wage increases through collective bargaining. The FTLF also objects to Ministerial Resolution No.  -TR, of  October , which obliges the arbitrators in collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget.\n.Case No.  refers essentially to the Civil Service Act, No. , issued in July  which according to the allegations of the complainant organizations, the CGTP, the CTP, SUTSA INIA, FESUTSA and the FTM-Per, restricts collective bargaining in all public entities to working conditions only, and excludes from negotiation, and any other participatory mechanism, subjects relating to wages or of economic significance. The above Act states, inter alia, that civil servants have the right to request improved non-monetary compensation, including changes to working or employment conditions, in accordance with the budgetary and infrastructure possibilities of the entity and the nature of the functions performed therein.\n.The Committee notes the Government s observations in which it states that the exercise of the right to collective bargaining for public sector workers, in the same way as any other right, is not absolute, but is subject to the limitations of the law, including those which regulate budgetary matters. In this connection, the Government explains that, in accordance with the General National Budget System Act, No. , FONAFE establishes, through its guidelines or directives, a wage ceiling in accordance with the budget assigned for state companies, so as to be able to implement their operational and strategic plans, and thus make them sustainable. The Government maintains that the actions or measures taken by FONAFE are carried out or performed on the basis of imperative or public order rules, without infringing any trade union rights.\n.In relation to the allegation of the complainant organizations, the FTLF and the CGTP, that the th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , No. , prohibits increases in workers' wages through collective bargaining and that, as a result, state electrical companies in FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses, the Committee notes that the Government states that FONAFE and companies in its sphere must comply with the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , and that therefore the actions or measures taken by FONAFE are carried out or performed on the basis of imperative or public order rules, without infringing any trade union rights. The Government explains that the aim of the rules governing the state public budget is to order and balance state expenditure, given that the resources are public and the product of the contributions made by all citizens and that different responsibilities entrusted to the State must be fulfilled.\n.The Committee notes that, as alleged by the complainant organizations and confirmed by the Government, the th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act, No. , restricts collective bargaining and labour arbitration to working conditions only, and that section  of that Act prohibits the readjustment, increase or creation of any form of income for public sector workers through whatever mechanism. The Committee observes that, as indicated by the complainant organization, the FTLF, and confirmed by the Government, FONAFE must comply with Act No. , and that as a result, state electrical companies within FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The Committee notes that the complainant organization, the FTLF, attached to its complaint copies of letters sent to FONAFE and to the electrical company, Electrocentro, SA, in which it requested that the th final supplementary provision of Act No.  should not be applied. As is clear from the attachments submitted by the complainant organization, in his reply the FONAFE Executive Director stated that Act No.  restricts collective bargaining and labour arbitration to working conditions only and emphasized that FONAFE must comply with the Act in question; for its part, the company Electrocentro, SA, stated that the Act was the responsibility of FONAFE and that it is not competent to deal with the request to revoke or contravene the content of the th final supplementary provision of Act No. .\n.The Committee wishes to emphasize that it has referred on various occasions to matters relating to collective bargaining in Peruvian legislation applicable to the public sector and that in the past few years it has made recommendations to the Government as part of complaints submitted by Peruvian trade union organizations, very similar to the present cases (Cases Nos  and ). The Committee recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to wage ceilings imposed by FONAFE in the wage scales of public electrical companies. The Committee reiterates its previous conclusions and once again recalls the principle, according to which  in so far as the income of public enterprises and bodies depends on state budgets, it would not be objectionable ' after wide discussion and consultation between the concerned employers' and employees' organizations in a system having the confidence of the parties ' for wage ceilings to be fixed in state budgetary laws' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requested the Government on that occasion  to ensure that trade unions in the public enterprises are consulted when setting budget ceilings for public enterprises with regard to wages, so that the trade unions concerned may assess the situation, express their views and positions and discuss with the authorities the considerations of general interest that these authorities may deem it necessary to highlight' [see th Report, para. ].\n.The Committee also recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to Ministerial Resolution No. --TR which obliges the arbitrators of collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget. The Committee notes that in its last reply the Government referred to the need for collective bargaining to take place within the state budgetary limits. The Committee reiterates its conclusion in Case No. , according to which  the requirement itself for arbitrators to take into account available resources in the public budget is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining'  and again requests the Government to ensure respect for its principles as regards salary restrictions in collective bargaining in the public sector [see Digest, op. cit., paras -] [see th Report, para. ].\n.Furthermore, as regards the civil service reform introduced by Act No. , the Committee notes that the reform applies to State workers at the three levels of government (national, regional and local), and that two draft regulations were issued together with the Act: regulations governing the general application of the Act and regulations covering the special system for local governments. Likewise, the Committee observes that, as is clear from the wording of the Act, staff covered by the old systems (workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (public careers), workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (system based on rules for the private sector) and workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (hired on administrative services contracts)) may be transferred, voluntarily and subject to a merit-based public competition, to the system provided for in the Act. Act No.  states that incorporation in the new system should take place gradually and that it will be finalized within a maximum period of six years.\n.As regards the allegations whereby the process of drafting the Civil Service Act No.  circumvented the mechanism for participation or consultation of workers' organizations, the Committee notes that the Government has not responded to this allegation and therefore recalls in general terms that"", ""budget is to order and balance state expenditure, given that the resources are public and the product of the contributions made by all citizens and that different responsibilities entrusted to the State must be fulfilled.\n.The Committee notes that, as alleged by the complainant organizations and confirmed by the Government, the th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act, No. , restricts collective bargaining and labour arbitration to working conditions only, and that section  of that Act prohibits the readjustment, increase or creation of any form of income for public sector workers through whatever mechanism. The Committee observes that, as indicated by the complainant organization, the FTLF, and confirmed by the Government, FONAFE must comply with Act No. , and that as a result, state electrical companies within FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The Committee notes that the complainant organization, the FTLF, attached to its complaint copies of letters sent to FONAFE and to the electrical company, Electrocentro, SA, in which it requested that the th final supplementary provision of Act No.  should not be applied. As is clear from the attachments submitted by the complainant organization, in his reply the FONAFE Executive Director stated that Act No.  restricts collective bargaining and labour arbitration to working conditions only and emphasized that FONAFE must comply with the Act in question; for its part, the company Electrocentro, SA, stated that the Act was the responsibility of FONAFE and that it is not competent to deal with the request to revoke or contravene the content of the th final supplementary provision of Act No. .\n.The Committee wishes to emphasize that it has referred on various occasions to matters relating to collective bargaining in Peruvian legislation applicable to the public sector and that in the past few years it has made recommendations to the Government as part of complaints submitted by Peruvian trade union organizations, very similar to the present cases (Cases Nos  and ). The Committee recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to wage ceilings imposed by FONAFE in the wage scales of public electrical companies. The Committee reiterates its previous conclusions and once again recalls the principle, according to which  in so far as the income of public enterprises and bodies depends on state budgets, it would not be objectionable ' after wide discussion and consultation between the concerned employers' and employees' organizations in a system having the confidence of the parties ' for wage ceilings to be fixed in state budgetary laws' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requested the Government on that occasion  to ensure that trade unions in the public enterprises are consulted when setting budget ceilings for public enterprises with regard to wages, so that the trade unions concerned may assess the situation, express their views and positions and discuss with the authorities the considerations of general interest that these authorities may deem it necessary to highlight' [see th Report, para. ].\n.The Committee also recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to Ministerial Resolution No. --TR which obliges the arbitrators of collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget. The Committee notes that in its last reply the Government referred to the need for collective bargaining to take place within the state budgetary limits. The Committee reiterates its conclusion in Case No. , according to which  the requirement itself for arbitrators to take into account available resources in the public budget is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining'  and again requests the Government to ensure respect for its principles as regards salary restrictions in collective bargaining in the public sector [see Digest, op. cit., paras -] [see th Report, para. ].\n.Furthermore, as regards the civil service reform introduced by Act No. , the Committee notes that the reform applies to State workers at the three levels of government (national, regional and local), and that two draft regulations were issued together with the Act: regulations governing the general application of the Act and regulations covering the special system for local governments. Likewise, the Committee observes that, as is clear from the wording of the Act, staff covered by the old systems (workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (public careers), workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (system based on rules for the private sector) and workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (hired on administrative services contracts)) may be transferred, voluntarily and subject to a merit-based public competition, to the system provided for in the Act. Act No.  states that incorporation in the new system should take place gradually and that it will be finalized within a maximum period of six years.\n.As regards the allegations whereby the process of drafting the Civil Service Act No.  circumvented the mechanism for participation or consultation of workers' organizations, the Committee notes that the Government has not responded to this allegation and therefore recalls in general terms that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate organizations of workers and employers [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Consequently, the Committee firmly expects that in future the Government will guarantee that, in practice, the trade unions participate in the consultations on any question or proposed legislation which affects the rights of the workers it represents.\n.As to the allegations according to which Act No.  infringes the right to strike by allowing public entities to hire, temporarily and directly, the staff necessary to guarantee the provision of minimum services in essential services and in services vital for the entity to operate, from the beginning of the strike until its actual end, the Committee notes that the Government considers that this would not cause problems of compatibility with the ILO Conventions, provided that the requirements established in the Act are satisfied, that is, the services qualified as essential are determined according to the criteria of the ILO supervisory bodies, the minimum services are defined with the participation of workers' organizations, and replacement workers are hired only where the minimum services have not been covered by the organization or workers exercising their right to strike and this situation leads to a serious risk to human life, safety or health. In this regard, the Committee recalls the principle according to which the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited in the public service or in essential services in so far as a strike there could cause serious hardship to the national community and provided that the limitations are accompanied by certain compensatory guarantees [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.As to the allegations that section  of Act No.  excludes public servants, public managers and trusted servants from collective rights, the Committee notes that the Government states that although no such exclusion exists in the strict sense of the term, a rule should be created which specifies the scope for the purposes of clearer interpretation. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article () of Convention No.  states that the extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Convention shall apply to high-level employees whose functions are normally considered as policy-making or managerial, or to employees whose duties are of a highly confidential nature, shall be determined by national laws or regulations. The Committee recalls, however, that under Convention No. , ratified by Peru, the right of collective bargaining can be denied only to public servants working in the state administration.\n.As to the allegations that section  of Act No.  adds major difficulties to the negotiating process given that once the list has been submitted, approval must be obtained from the National Civil Service Authority (SERVIR) and from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the agreements reached between the representatives of the public entity and the civil servants are valid for a minimum of two years, the Committee notes that the Government stresses that the Committee on Freedom of Association has held that  the duration of collective agreements is primarily a matter for the partners involved'  In this regard, the Committee recalls firstly that budgetary opportunities within the negotiating framework may be verified and, secondly, recalls the principle according to which  a statutory provision providing that a collective agreement should be in force for two years when no other period has been agreed by the parties does not constitute a violation of the right to collective bargaining' [see Digest, op. cit. para. ]. Consequently, the Committee will not continue with the examination of these allegations.\n.In relation to the allegation by the complainant organizations that section  of Act No.  circumvents collective bargaining in all public entities to working conditions only, excluding subjects relating"", ""that the resources are public and the product of the contributions made by all citizens and that different responsibilities entrusted to the State must be fulfilled.\n.The Government states that the Constitutional Court had the opportunity to make a ruling on the right to collective bargaining and the prohibition on making any type of increases to public administration staff, even where this is the result of labour arbitration. The Government emphasizes that in Rulings Nos --AI/TC and --PA-TC, the Constitutional Court made it clear that collective bargaining involving public servants must be done, taking into consideration the constitutional limit, according to which the budget must be balanced and fair. The Government adds that similar conclusions have also been put forward by the Supreme Court of Justice in Appeal No. --Lambayeque, which states that collective bargaining must be carried out in the public sector, taking into account the national budgetary laws which determine the scope of negotiation.\n.The Government states that, notwithstanding the above, it emerged that in various arbitration awards the arbitrators adopted contrary, and even challenging, positions, stating expressly in their pronouncements that the budgetary restrictions established in the public sector budget laws would not be applied, ordering increases in wages without any technical support or identifiable source of funding, which affect the principle of a balanced budget and create disorder in the public sector, and that the National Congress chose to regulate this situation, by including the provision in the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , which is brought into question by the CTP.\n.In its communications dated  and  September , the Government made its observations concerning the allegations relating to the Civil Service Act, No. . As to the allegation that the Act excludes public servants, public managers and trusted servants from the right to join trade unions, the Government indicates that although no such exclusion exists in the strict sense of the term, a rule should be created which specifies the scope for the purposes of clearer interpretation. As regards the allegation that the Act allows, in the case of a strike, staff to be hired temporarily in order to guarantee the provision of minimum services in essential services and in services vital for the entity to operate, the Government understands that this provision would not cause problems of compatibility with the ILO Conventions, provided that the requirements established in the Act are satisfied, that is, the services defined as essential are determined according to the criteria of the ILO supervisory bodies, the minimum services are defined with the participation of workers' organizations, and replacement workers are hired only where the minimum services have not been covered by the organization or workers exercising their right to strike and this situation leads to a serious risk to human life, safety or health. With respect to the allegation that the Act limits the right to collective bargaining by requiring to negotiate for a period of two years, the Government stresses that the Committee on Freedom of Association has held that  the duration of collective agreements is primarily a matter for the parties involved.' As concerns the allegation that the Act limits the right to collective bargaining, restricting its content only to working conditions and excluding therefrom, and from any other participatory mechanism, subjects relating to wages or of economic significance, the Government understands that the Act may be viewed as taking a backward step in the recognition and effectiveness of a fundamental right such as collective bargaining, and considers that these aspects should be included in a legislative provision. On the last point, the Government reports that on  May , the Plenum of the Constitutional Court issued a ruling which settled the case of failure to observe the Constitution brought by  members of the National Congress against various articles of the Act. The Government notes that, although under section  of the Basic Law of the Constitutional Court, the majority of votes required to declare valid the allegations contained in the complaint relating to the unconstitutional nature of Act No. , since it adversely affects the right to collective bargaining, three of the judges consider that the exclusion of remuneration and budgetary matters from collective bargaining constitutes an infringement of the aforementioned constitutional right. Moreover, a further three judges consider that Act No.  will be constitutional only if, within  days, a consultation mechanism is set up. Finally, the Government emphasizes that in both cases the Constitutional Court used the ILO Conventions ratified by Peru as a benchmark of constitutionality.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the hiring of staff during a strike constitutes a measure of an exceptional nature, the new regulations prescribe that it is applicable in situations in which minimum services are not respected. With respect to collective bargaining, the abovementioned Act defines the scope of the right to collective bargaining and is justified by the fact that it avoids differences that currently exist in regard to the negotiation of wages and the disorder that may result from different rules in the negotiation of wages based on the employment relationship of the worker. The Act establishes technical and objective criteria for increasing wages and takes into account the principle of budgetary provision.\n.The Committee notes that in both cases the allegations refer to legal restrictions and, in practice, to collective bargaining in the public sector and, in particular, the impossibility to increase public sector wages through collective bargaining. Case No.  refers essentially to the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , No. , and more precisely to the th final supplementary provision which, according to the allegations of the complainant organizations, the FTLF and the CGTP, prohibits wage increases for workers through collective bargaining. The above provision states, inter alia, that negotiation or labour arbitration proceedings may contain only working conditions; that arbitration resolutions, agreements or awards which ignore said prohibition will be null and void ipso jure, and that arbitrators who fail to implement that provision will no longer be entitled to participate in public sector collective bargaining arbitration processes.\n.According to the complainant organization, the FTLF, and as confirmed by the Government, FONAFE must comply with the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year  and, as a result, state electrical companies in FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The complainant organization also alleges that FONAFE establishes wage ceilings for state electrical companies that comply with the budget assigned for state companies, limiting the possibilities of negotiating wage increases through collective bargaining. The FTLF also objects to Ministerial Resolution No.  -TR, of  October , which obliges the arbitrators in collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget.\n.Case No.  refers essentially to the Civil Service Act, No. , issued in July  which according to the allegations of the complainant organizations, the CGTP, the CTP, SUTSA INIA, FESUTSA and the FTM-Per, restricts collective bargaining in all public entities to working conditions only, and excludes from negotiation, and any other participatory mechanism, subjects relating to wages or of economic significance. The above Act states, inter alia, that civil servants have the right to request improved non-monetary compensation, including changes to working or employment conditions, in accordance with the budgetary and infrastructure possibilities of the entity and the nature of the functions performed therein.\n.The Committee notes the Government s observations in which it states that the exercise of the right to collective bargaining for public sector workers, in the same way as any other right, is not absolute, but is subject to the limitations of the law, including those which regulate budgetary matters. In this connection, the Government explains that, in accordance with the General National Budget System Act, No. , FONAFE establishes, through its guidelines or directives, a wage ceiling in accordance with the budget assigned for state companies, so as to be able to implement their operational and strategic plans, and thus make them sustainable. The Government maintains that the actions or measures taken by FONAFE are carried out or performed on the basis of imperative or public order rules, without infringing any trade union rights.\n.In relation to the allegation of the complainant organizations, the FTLF and the CGTP, that the th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , No. , prohibits increases in workers' wages through collective bargaining and that, as a result, state electrical companies in FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses, the Committee notes that the Government states that FONAFE and companies in its sphere must comply with the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , and that therefore the actions or measures taken by FONAFE are carried out or performed on the basis of imperative or public order rules, without infringing any trade union rights. The Government explains that the aim of the rules governing the state public""]"

The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented the complaint corresponding to Case No.  in a communication dated  April .\n.Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).\n.The Government representative at the st Session of the International Labour Conference (June ) subsequently handed in a number of documents containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. ,  and .\n.At the st Session (Geneva, ) of the International Labour Conference, the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos.  and  (both ratified by Paraguay).\n.Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication dated  June  to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which took place from  to  September  in Asuncin, and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on  September for the purpose of contacting and discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE). The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards. The report on the mission is attached.\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.\n.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .\n.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).\n.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government\'s position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.\n.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government\'s statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions\' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.\n.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals', '.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the complaints corresponding to Cases Nos.  (communications dated  and  May and  and  October ),  (communication dated  April ),  (communications dated  and  September ), and  (communication dated  June ).

The report on the mission is attached.\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively  and  October , presented new allegations in connection with Case No. . These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazn Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers, has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned in the police station in Asuncin, where he is being subjected to physical and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights. He is now on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is feared that his life is in danger. In a communication dated  October , the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazn Medina has been transferred, in a serious condition, to the prison hospital. In addition, it alleges that for about  days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastin Rodrguez (Secretary General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of ""Asuncin-Fernando de la Mora"" Line ) for the sole reason of having organised a musical festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  October  in which it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released.\n.The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations of the complainant organisations.\n.Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on each case.\n.The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the Director-General on the mission carried out from  to  September  in Paraguay. The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable him to carry out the mission. The Committee observes in this respect that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under consideration. It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence which were made in the context of Cases Nos.  and .\n.Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released. The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo (detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the publication ""ABC Color"") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied by the Government). The Committee also observes that the Government denies in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were connected with trade union activities. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations were presented (May and October ), and the fact that all of the persons concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).\n.As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality, the Committee observes that in  the Labour Directorate notified the trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance such as the existence of another association for the same purposes. The Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government\'s position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any steps since  for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up. While the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future. In addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment of another organisation, if the workers so wish.\n.As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the ""Amrica Textil"" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy between the contents of the allegations and the Government\'s statements. While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of requests in the trade unions\' list of claims. The Government, however, stated that the dismissals (affecting  workers) had taken place a month before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition. The Committee regrets that the Amrica Textil undertaking has refused to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify the facts. In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment for carrying out trade union activities.\n.Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no undertaking called ""FRISA S.A."" and that Radio anduti was closed down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for political reasons.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour Appeals']"

The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  and  January , one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated  January , one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated  February , one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated  March , one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated  June  and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated  September .\n.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .\n.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.\n.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.\n.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.\n.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities.

It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers\' and workers\' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers\' and workers\' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.\n.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers\' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers\' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners\' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners\' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June  session,', '.The Committee has already examined allegations relating to the years immediately following the change of regime on  August  (closing down of the COB, the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers and the FSTMB; takeover of the National Urban Schoolteachers\' Federation; arrest and banishment of trade unionists). It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights.

This being the case, the Committee again requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the above legal proceedings and to send a copy of the decisions made.\n.With regard to subparagraph (l) of the recommendations concerning disciplinary measures against members of SINALTRABAVARIA, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the ordinary legal proceedings brought by the workers concerned were resolved in one case in favour of the company and in the other in favour of the plaintiff. In the latter case, the Committee notes the Government s statement that damages were duly paid to the worker and that all the legal proceedings brought against Bavaria S.A. in this regard were thereby exhausted. The Committee also notes the information supplied by the Government that, in situations of this nature, a trade union has recourse to administrative and legal channels to uphold any rights it feels have been infringed, noting that the administrative authorities monitor and control compliance with labour law, while the legal authorities consider controversies which merit value judgements in order finally to establish how a right should be recognized.\n.With regard to subparagraph (m) of the recommendations concerning anti-union discrimination presented by SINALTRABAVARIA (pressure on workers to resign from the trade union, denial of trade union leave, delay on the part of the Ministry of Social Protection in carrying out inspections to confirm anti-union activities in the enterprise and in the registration of new executive committees, and the hiring by the enterprise as a labour cooperative of workers that it had previously dismissed), the Committee notes the Government s statement with regard to pressure on workers to resign from the trade union that, as yet, the union has been unable to prove its claims, since there exists neither a verdict convicting the company nor an administrative decision sanctioning the company for the aforementioned pressure. The Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the full application of this principle.\n.With regard to the allegations concerning the denial of trade union leave, the Committee notes the Government s statement that Bavaria S.A. has not been convicted of the alleged denial of trade union leave. The Committee observes that the Government does not clearly specify whether proceedings have been brought against the company in this regard and, if so, whether they found in favour of the company. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. In any event, the Committee recalls that, in accordance with paragraph  of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), workers' representatives should be afforded the necessary time for carrying out their representation functions and that, while workers' representatives may be required to obtain permission from the management before taking time off, such permission should not be unreasonably withheld [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles in the future.\n.With regard to the delay on the part of the Ministry of Social Protection in dealing with matters brought to its attention, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Ministry has fulfilled its duties and obligations in accordance with the powers given to it in law, but that, on various occasions, complaints have been archived through lack of legal interest on the part of the trade union.\n.With regard to the registration of trade union executive committees, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that trade unions must act within the law and their own statutes, and that, if they do not, then they cannot be taken to be legally constituted by the Ministry of Social Protection, but that, nevertheless, the members of such bodies can form new bodies by fulfilling the legal requirements. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government and information supplied by Bavaria S.A., no cooperatives formed by dismissed staff are operating at the company.\n.With regard to subparagraph (o) of the recommendations concerning the failure to implement the Committee s recommendation for the reinstatement of or payment of full compensation to Mr. Romero, the Committee notes that, in its verdict of  June , the Upper Tribunal of Medelln ordered the company to pay Mr. Jaime Rodrigo Romero Gonzlez the sum of $,, in damages for wrongful dismissal and $,,. in indexing, a decision which was confirmed by the Labour Annulment Division of the Supreme Court of Justice on  September . Consequently, on  November , once all the legal processes had been completed, the company, complying with the verdict of the Upper Tribunal of Medelln, proceeded to pay the amounts owed in damages and indexing, to which had been added payment of costs.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissing and sanctioning of workers belonging to SINALTRABAVARIA for participating in a strike at the company on  August , the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to expedite the judicial procedure under way and to continue to keep it informed of the results of the actions and proceedings brought.(b) With regard to the dismissal of trade union officers at the Caja de Crdito Agrario, in disregard of trade union immunity and in contravention of the rulings ordering the reinstatement of a number of these officers, with regard to which the Council of State considered in a resolution that the individual rights of the applicants were safeguarded by acknowledgement of the arrears of wages owed from the time the posts were abolished until the notification of an administrative act setting out the reasons why reinstatement was not possible, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure, bearing in mind the time elapsed, that the procedures still to be completed for payment of salaries and benefits to the remaining workers are finalized quickly, and to keep it informed in this regard.(c) With regard to the refusal to register the trade union organizations USITAC, SINALTRABET and UNITAS on grounds of legal flaws, the Committee recalls that, although the founders of a trade union should comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to impair the free establishment of organizations and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that, as soon as the minimum requirements are fulfilled, the authorities proceed with registration of the trade unions USITAC, SINALTRABET and UNITAS.(d) With regard to the actions taken by the enterprise in order to suspend the trade union immunity of William de Jess Puerta Cano, Jos Everardo Rodas, Alberto Ruiz and Jorge William Restrepo, the Committee requests the Government to inform it as to whether the union officials have been finally dismissed and to give the reasons for such action being taken.(e) With regard to the alleged subsequent dismissal without cause of SINALTRAINBEC officials and founders of the Trade Union of Workers in the Beverages and Foodstuffs Industry (USTIBEA), who also include William de Jess Puerta Cano, together with Luis Fernando Viana Pario, Edgar Daro Castrilln Munera and Alberto de Jess Bedoya Ros, on the grounds of serious disciplinary offences, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out to establish whether these dismissals took place following suspension of trade union immunity, and bearing in mind that, according to the information supplied by the Government, workers can only be reinstated once they have begun the appropriate legal action, to keep it informed of any legal action begun or cases brought with this aim. The Committee recalls that, if the competent authorities determine that the dismissals were of an anti-union nature, the unionists in question should be reinstated in their posts.(f) As regards the legal impossibility to form industry unions grouping workers of various types of industry, the Committee recalls that, in conformity with Article  of Convention No. , workers have the right to form organizations of their own choosing and consequently it is for workers to determine the union structure they desire.(g) With regard to the dismissal of members of the complainant organization SINALTRAINBEC, and the early retirement schemes adopted by the company and accepted by some members, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal proceedings brought in respect of these measures.(h) With regard to the closure of the COLENVASES plant, leading to the dismissal of  workers and seven union officials without trade union immunity being suspended and without complying with the Ministry of Labour s resolution"", ""workers of various types of industry, the Committee recalls that, in conformity with Article  of Convention No. , workers have the right to form organizations of their own choosing and consequently it is for workers to determine the union structure they desire.(g) With regard to the dismissal of members of the complainant organization SINALTRAINBEC, and the early retirement schemes adopted by the company and accepted by some members, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal proceedings brought in respect of these measures.(h) With regard to the closure of the COLENVASES plant, leading to the dismissal of  workers and seven union officials without trade union immunity being suspended and without complying with the Ministry of Labour s resolution which authorized the closure but ordered the prior application of clauses  and  of the collective agreement in force, the Committee again requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the legal proceedings brought by SINALTRABAVARIA before the administrative judicial authorities concerning resolutions Nos. ,  and  and to send a copy of the decisions made.(i) With regard to the allegations presented by SINTRABAVARIA concerning pressure on workers to resign from the trade union, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee the full application of the principle that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities.(j) With regard to the allegations presented by SINTRABAVARIA concerning the denial of trade union leave, the Committee requests the Government to ensure respect in future for the principles contained in Paragraph  of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), and to indicate whether proceedings have been brought against the company in this respect and, if so, whether the outcome was in favour of the employer.\n.In a communication dated  May , the Single Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CUT), in connection with the allegations presented by the Trade Union of Workers of the National Coffee Growers Federation of Colombia and Almacenes Generales de Deposito de Caf S.A. (SINTRAFEC), states that the ordinary check-off of union dues is still not been made for workers who are not members of SINTRAFEC but benefit from the collective agreement concluded. According to the complainant, regardless of the Committee s recommendations following earlier examination of the case requesting the Government to carry out an investigation, no information on the subject has as yet been received. The complainant adds that several workers have been dismissed, whose names appear in an appended list, including Alba Lucia Ris Mora, Jos Horacio Rivera Posada and Jaime Enrique Angulo, who were dismissed on the same day that notification was given that they had joined the trade union, and Luz Adriana Marquez Velasquez and Carlos Odilio Perala Ospina were dismissed eight days after joining. In addition, the National Coffee Federation regularly uses the associated labour cooperatives to replace workers on indefinite contracts, despite the fact that this is banned in the collective labour agreement.\n.In a communication dated  June , the National Trade Union of Workers in the Industry for the Production, Manufacture and Processing of Food and Dairy Products (SINALTRAPROAL) reports that the Council of State rejected the trade union s complaint against the Ministry of Labour and Social Security s resolution refusing to register the members elected to the Board of SINTRANOEL and also to register the change of status whereby the company-based union SINTRANOEL became an industry union (SINALTRAPROAL), both dated  May , refusing furthermore to register the new members of the SINTRANOEL Board approved by the assembly on  June . According to the Council of State, following the division of the company Industrias Alimenticias Noel to form two separate companies: Compania Galletas Noel S.A. and Industrias Alimenticias Noel S.A., workers in the employ of one of the companies could not sit on the board of the trade union of the other company and that there were no grounds for changing the company trade union organization into an industry organization because this occurred after the company had been divided into two separate companies.\n.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that, in regard to the alleged dismissals and sanctions against workers belonging to SINALTRABAVARIA for participating in a stoppage in the company on  August , the cases in question are still before the labour court. To date, the Bavaria company has been found guilty of dismissal without cause, but it is not obliged to reinstate or pay either a retirement benefit or compensation to Mr. Luis Alfredo Quintero Velasquez; it was ordered to pay compensation to Mr. Alfonso Maigal Valdez and Mr. Jos Luis Salazar, on  February . The Government adds that both the company and the workers have appealed, and these cases are currently ongoing.\n.In regard to the dismissal of trade union officers of the Caja de Credito Agrario, in disregard of trade union immunity and in contravention of the rulings ordering the reinstatement of a number of these officers, the Government states that, of the total  court cases,  have been completed ( acquittals and five convictions) and the remaining  are ongoing. In the cases culminating in convictions, the Caja de Credito Agrario in Liquidation has issued an administrative notice stating that it is physically and legally unable to effect reinstatement, and ordering the liquidation and payment of wages and benefits in arrears from the time the posts were abolished until the notification of the act stating that reinstatement was not possible.\n.As regards the refusal to register the trade union organizations USITAC, SINALTRABET and UNITAS, the Government states that all the administrative remedies initiated by the trade union organizations have been exhausted and that judicial remedies are available but that, to date, no judicial proceedings have been initiated.\n.As regards the actions taken by the enterprise to suspend the trade union immunity of William de Jsus Puerta Cano, Jos Everardo Rodas, Alberto Ruiz and Jorge William Restrepo, the Government states that the enterprise has withdrawn its application for suspension of trade union immunity for Messrs. Puerta, Rodas and Ruiz in light of the fact that they never had trade union immunity since the South Itagui directorate to which they belonged failed to meet the minimum qualifying requirements. The Government adds that their dismissals were justified by their refusal to attend training sessions. The Government further states that, with regard to Mr. Puerta Cano, the Superior Court of Medelln ruled that he did not qualify for trade union immunity; the cases of Messrs. Rodas and Ruiz are still before the ordinary court.\n.In regard to the alleged subsequent dismissal without cause of SINALTRAINBEC officials and of founders of the Trade Union of Workers of the Beverages and Foodstuffs Industry (USTIBEA), including William de Jsus Puerta Cano, together with Luis Fernando Viana Patio, Edgar Dario Castrilln Munera and Alberto de Jsus Bedoya Ris, on the grounds of serious disciplinary offences, the Government states that the Ministry for Social Protection does not have competence to initiate investigations into dismissals without cause, since this can only be performed by a judge. The Government states that it is up to workers to initiate proceedings for dismissal without cause and undertakes to inform the Committee of any legal proceedings that are initiated in this connection.\n.As regards the contention that it is not legally possible to establish industry unions composed of members in the employ of different types of industries, as in the case of SINALTRAINBEC and USTIBEA, which have been refused registration, the Government states that this decision is based on public health and sanitary considerations in that this trade union organization would include workers from the food and alcoholic beverages industries, and denies that the decision is motivated in any way by anti-union discrimination policy.\n.As regards the dismissals of workers belonging to the complainant organization SINALTRAINBEC, and the early retirement schemes adopted by the company and which were taken up by some members, the Government states that no legal proceedings have as yet been initiated.\n.As regards the closure of the COLENVASES plant, leading to the dismissal of  employees and seven trade union leaders without suspending their trade union immunity and without complying with the Ministry of Labour s resolution authorizing the closure but ordering prior compliance with clauses  and  of the collective agreement in force, the Government states that a verdict is awaited from the Administrative Dispute Tribunal and that the Committee will be informed as soon as it is handed down. The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security issued resolution No.  on  September  ordering the company to comply with clauses  and , but that the subsequent resolution No.  omits the word  prior'  These resolutions were confirmed by resolution No.  of  December .\n.As regards the allegations presented by SINALTRABAVARIA concerning the pressure on workers to resign from the trade union, the Government states that no"", ""Products (SINALTRAPROAL) regarding the refusal to register the members elected to the board of SINTRANOEL and also to register the change of status whereby the company-based union SINTRANOEL became an industry union (SINALTRAPROAL), and the refusal furthermore to register the new members of the SINTRANOEL board following the division of the company Industrias Alimenticias Noel to form two separate companies: Compania Galletas Noel S.A. and Industrias Alimenticias Noel S.A., on the grounds that, according to the Council of State, workers in the employ of one of the companies could not sit on the board of the trade union of the other company and that there were no grounds for changing the company trade union organization into an industry organization because this had occurred after the company had been divided into two separate companies, the Committee regrets that the Government has failed to forward its observations. The Committee repeats its request to the Government to take measures to ensure full application of Convention No. , Article , in keeping with the abovementioned principles.\n.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -].\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  and  January .\n.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.At its meeting in June , when it examined allegations relating to acts of anti-union discrimination and persecution at a number of companies, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) [ (b) with regard to the alleged dismissals and disciplinary measures against members of SINALTRABAVARIA for participating in a work stoppage at the enterprise on  August , taking into account the time that has passed since the events occurred, the Committee firmly hopes that the labour courts will give a ruling as soon as possible, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect;(c) [ (d) [ (e) as regards the allegations concerning the untimely closure of enterprises, the dismissal of many trade union officers and members of various branches, and pressure so that they accept a voluntary retirement scheme, in respect of which the Cundinamarca Inspection and Oversight Group decided in a resolution that the workers were not dismissed but signed conciliation agreements, and that there were no untimely closures of enterprises, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the trade union concerned has lodged any appeal against the resolution;(f) as regards the dismissal of trade union officers at the Caja de Crdito Agrario, in disregard of trade union immunity and in contravention of the rulings ordering the reinstatement of a number of these officers, with regard to which the Council of State considered in a resolution that the individual rights of the applicants were safeguarded by acknowledgement of the arrears of wages owed from the time the posts were abolished until the notification of an administrative act setting out the reasons why reinstatement was not possible, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether wages and other benefits owed to workers have been paid in accordance with the resolution in question, and if this is not the case, to ensure immediate payment;(g) as regards the refusal to register the trade union organizations USITAC, SINALTRABET and UNITAS on grounds of legal flaws, the Committee once again urges the Government to register USITAC, SINALTRABET and UNITAS and to keep it informed in this regard;(h) as regards the alleged dismissals of trade union officers and members who enjoyed trade union immunity in their capacity as union founders and of other trade union members as a result of the creation of USITAC, the Committee requests the Government to guarantee the rapid and adequate functioning of legal procedures and to indicate whether the enterprise sought judicial authorization before the dismissal and, if not, to indicate whether the trade union officers concerned have lodged the corresponding appeals and what was the outcome;(i) with regard to the actions taken by the enterprise in order to suspend the trade union immunity of William de Jess Puerta Cano, Jos Everardo Rodas, Alberto Ruiz and Jorge William Restrepo, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these actions;(j) as regards the allegations concerning the dismissal of members of the complainant organization, [  the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the workers have lodged appeals against the decisions to dismiss them [ ;(k) as regards the closure of the COLENVASES plant, the Committee once again urges the Government to forward the court rulings as soon as they are handed down;(l) with regard to the allegations concerning disciplinary measures against members of SINALTRABAVARIA, the Committee once again requests the Government to carry out an investigation to establish the facts and, in the light of the investigation s conclusions, to indicate the avenues of legal redress available to the trade union to safeguard its rights, and to take measures to adapt its legislation and legal procedures in line with Conventions Nos.  and ;(m) with regard to the allegations concerning anti-union discrimination presented by SINALTRABAVARIA (pressure on workers to resign from the trade union, denial of trade union leave, delay on the part of the Ministry of Social Protection in carrying out inspections to confirm anti-union activities in the enterprise and in the registration of new executive committees, and the hiring by the enterprise as a labour cooperative of workers that it had previously dismissed), the Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations in this respect without delay;(n) with regard to allegations relating to dismissals presented by SINALTRAINBEC through a system of early retirement, the Committee requests the complainant organization to provide further information in this regard;(o) with regard to the failure to implement the Committee s recommendation for the reinstatement of or payment of full compensation to Mr. Romero, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this respect and to indicate whether Mr. Romero has promptly received full compensation;(p) the Committee takes note of the recent communication by SINALTRAINBEC and requests the Government to send its observations in this respect. (In this communication, SINALTRAINBEC stated that on  March  the Trade Union of Workers in the Beverages and Foodstuffs Industry (USTIBEA) was formed, and that the company was notified on  April . In spite of this, on ,  and  April , Cervecera Unin S.A. dismissed SINALTRAINBEC officials William de Jess Puerta Cano, Luis Fernando Viana Patio, Edgar Daro Castrilln Munera and Alberto de Jess Bedoya Ros without cause, alleging serious disciplinary offences. The complainant adds that the company wanted, without its employees' consent, to extend working hours for staff training.)\n.In its communications dated  September  and  and  January , the Government sent its observations on the recommendations made by the Committee at its last meeting. The Government also sent the comments of the Cervecera Unin S.A. company concerning certain recommendations of the Committee.\n.With regard to item (b), concerning the alleged dismissing and sanctioning of workers belonging to SINALTRABAVARIA for participating in a strike at the company on  August , the Government states that the Ministry of Social Protection carried out an administrative investigation and, by resolution No.  of  February , refrained from taking any measures against Bavaria S.A., a decision which was confirmed by resolution No.  of  July , leaving the company cleared of any blame. The Government adds that the company reports that ordinary proceedings have continued according to the timescales and in the manner established by domestic legislation, and that considerable progress has been made.\n.Thus, in the ordinary labour proceedings brought by Mr. Luis Alfredo Quintero Velsquez against Malteras de Colombia S.A., the Ninth Labour Court of the Bogot Circuit delivered its verdict on  April , clearing Bavaria S.A. of each and every allegation made. However, it did order payment of damages to the plaintiff, since it considered that the offence committed by the plaintiff, although proven, was not serious. The Government states that the aforementioned verdict clarified that the dismissal was not motivated by the plaintiff s participation in the strike, since it occurred only for the reasons given by the employer in its letter terminating the contract, which made no mention whatsoever of the national strike of  August . The Government states that this verdict has been appealed by the legal representatives of both parties and is awaiting a decision from the Upper Tribunal of Bogot.\n.In the ordinary labour proceedings brought by Alfonso Maigual Valdez and Jos Luis Salazar against Bavaria S.A., the Sixteenth Labour Court of the Bogot Circuit declared the probatory term closed and set a date for the verdict to be given on  November . The Government states that the dismissals in this case were likewise not motivated by the participation of the workers concerned in a national strike, but by""]"

It was not members of the Ministry of the Interior, but neighbours from the district, who participated in this demonstration. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August .\n.As regards Lazaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lazaro Corp Yeras left the country in September , when he went to live in the United States.\n.The Government points out that the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers\' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question.\n.The Government states that there are  national sectorial trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around  per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers\' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, when in fact their activities have nothing to do with trade union matters, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.\n.In the light of all these matters, the Government requests the Committee on Freedom of Association to conclude that this case should be definitively closed.\n.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba and refers to different acts committed against trade unionists or officials of independent trade union organizations: injuries, detentions, serious threats, acts of intimidation and harassment, refusals to grant permission to leave Cuba to attend trade union meetings and the refusal to grant legal personality to the CTDC and an anti-union dismissal.\n.The Committee notes the statements by the Government and in particular, that  per cent of workers in the country are members of  national sectorial trade unions, whose representatives are appointed and elected by the workers themselves, and that through their different bodies, trade union organizations participate systematically in the decision-making process. Moreover, the Committee observes that the Government states as regards the allegations contained in the first communication from the complainant organization that the persons to whom it refers do not have the status of trade unionists, do not represent any workers\' collective and do not have any employment relationship with any enterprise or any occupational activity in the country, and that their activities are not related to trade union matters - their objective is allegedly to obtain personal benefit - and that the events in question are not of a trade union nature.\n.In accordance with its usual practice, the Committee will carry out an examination of the different allegations on the basis of specific observations made by the Government; however, it would like to emphasize that in the light of all the information at its disposal it must determine whether or not there have been infringements of freedom of association, with account being taken of the provisions of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Cuba. The Committee must therefore take into account the fact that there exists only one officially recognized central trade union organization mentioned in the legislation and that on previous occasions, complaints have been made concerning the refusal to grant official recognition to trade union organizations outside the existing officially recognized trade union structure. In the same way, in its last report (), the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations requested the Government ""to guarantee in law and in practice the right of all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom"" (see Report III (Part A), ILC, nd Session, , p. ).\n.As regards the alleged refusal to grant permission to leave Cuba (November  and June ) to Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, a trade unionist of the Union of Workers of Cuba, thus preventing him from attending meetings organized by the ICFTU, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Mr. Gutierrez was on bail at the time, pending judicial proceedings against him in the criminal courts, so that he could not complete his plans for travelling to a foreign country, and that he subsequently left the country on the dates mentioned by the ICFTU. In this respect, observing that the Government has not indicated the specific allegations made against Mr. Gutierrez in the criminal proceedings and bearing in mind that the Government has not denied the statement by the complainant organization that this person was imprisoned for trying to obtain official recognition of the Union of Workers of Cuba, the Committee concludes that the authorities refused Mr. Gutierrez permission to leave the country to attend ICFTU meetings because of proceedings related to the carrying out of legitimate trade union activities. The Committee therefore deplores that Mr. Gutierrez was not permitted to attend two meetings organized by the ICFTU and requests the Government in future to guarantee respect of the principle whereby ""since participation by unionists in international trade union meetings is a fundamental trade union right, governments should abstain from any measure ... that would prevent representatives of workers\' organizations from exercising their mandate in full freedom and independence"". (See th Report, Case No.  (Zambia), para. ; rd Report, Case No.  (Lesotho), para. .)\n.As regards the alleged serious injuries caused by three men (concerning whom the complainant organization states that it has reason to believe had links with the Cuban security forces) against the persons of Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Workers of Cuba, and his younger son in August , the Committee notes that the Government states that it is totally false that Mr. Lazaro Corp was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior, that he made no complaint and that he left the country in September . The Committee wishes to emphasize that the complainant organization did not say that the injuries to Mr. Corp and his young son were caused by ""members of the Ministry of the Interior"", but by persons who had links ""with the Cuban security forces""; moreover, the complainant organization pointed out that this was the fifth act of aggression against Mr. Corp in less than three months. In this respect, the Committee believes that the terms in which the Government\'s reply is worded do not exclude the possibility that Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son were assaulted and injured because of the trade union status or activities of the former. The Committee therefore requests the Government in future to ensure that no trade union official or trade unionist should be assaulted because of his or her trade union status or activities, and of course neither should his or her family members. The Committee requests the Government to set up a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries inflicted on the trade union official Mr. Lazaro Corp and his younger son despite the fact that they no longer live in Cuba, and to keep it informed in this respect.\n.Furthermore, the Committee notes the allegations concerning Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers: threats to make her disappear or to imprison her made by a commander in May  when she was summoned to appear at the Department of State Security; body search and stripping; placing in an intimidation cell; new threats of attack and beating by ""mobs"" and ""neighbours""; a demonstration by the ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the home of Edith Lupe, where dissidents Juan Jos Lpez and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also present; and participation by officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba in the demonstration.\n.In this respect the Committee notes that the Government states: () that the name of the person in question was not Edith Lupe but Enid Amelia Luque; () that she was summoned by the national police and given a warning because of her provocative activities which were contrary to public order, in accordance with the legislation; ()', 'offensive interrogation;- according to the complainant organization\'s sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n.In its reply, the Government cited the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n.Referring to various allegations, the Government made the following observations:- the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On  May, she was summoned to the th station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in the Capri district, and was given a warning for having carried provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States. Enid Amelia Luque Rosales left the country in August ;- as regards Lzaro Corp Yeras, the Government states that it is totally erroneous to say that he was assaulted by members of the Ministry of the Interior. If this person, as he says, was the victim of any act of violence by unknown persons, he could have made a denunciation to the police, which he did not do. Lzaro Corp Yeras left the country in September , when he went to live in the United States;- the Committee on Freedom of Association should be cautious about statements from persons of doubtful credibility such as those concerning the persons mentioned in the complaint, which do not give the true identity of the persons, or the address of their residence, the name and address of the workplace where they are supposedly leaders of workers\' collectives, and who have not even established their status as workers at the time in question;- there are  national sectoral trade unions in Cuba, whose members include around  per cent of the workers in the country. Freedom of association is exercised in all workplaces by workers\' collectives and their trade union representatives are nominated and elected by the workers themselves. Under the Cuban labour relations system, the different bodies of the trade union organizations participate systematically, through a wide variety of fora, in the decision-making process on matters of interest to workers. According to the Government, the ICFTU has been misinformed; the facts have been distorted by unscrupulous persons who claim to be trade unionists, and their only purpose is to obtain personal benefit through recourse to international procedures and propaganda.\n.The Committee formulated the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):- the Committee requests the Government to open a judicial inquiry into the serious injuries allegedly inflicted on the trade union official Lzaro Corp and his younger son, and to keep it informed in this respect;- as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of and threats and other acts of harassment against Enid Amelia Luque, Organization Secretary of the Trade Union Front of the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba, the Committee requests the Government to provide the more detailed information to which reference is made in the conclusions, so that it can examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts (in this respect, in its conclusions, the Committee had pointed out that the Government had not explained the substance of the ""acts of provocation against public order"" by Enid Amelia Luque and ""four delinquents"", and which resulted in a ""warning"" being delivered in the offices of the national police, or of the ""demonstration"" against her conduct by neighbours from the district, or the content of the ""warning"" by the national police (see th Report, para. ));- finally, noting that the Government had not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organization in its communication of  July , the Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on:- - the refusal to grant legal personality to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC);- - the arrest and harassment of and threats against several officials of the CTDC;- - the expulsion from his work centre of a trade unionist of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization after he had called for better working conditions.\n.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras and his son were not attacked by ""persons linked with the Cuban security forces"", as stated by the complainant organization without providing any proof. No formal complaint to this effect has been lodged with any police unit. It was also ascertained that Mr. Lzaro Corp Yeras is not a trade union official, nor does he represent any workers\' collective or have an employment relationship with any workplace. This person left the country in September .\n.As regards the allegations concerning Ms. Enid Amelia Luque, the Government states that in addition to the information given in its previous reply of  July , which it confirms, according to the inquiries made, Ms. Enid Amelia Luque caused a public scandal and disorder near her place of residence, making offensive statements to which the neighbours reacted by expressing rejection of her conduct. There were no acts of violence, only a public scandal, disrupting neighbourly relations. The Government adds that the warning in question was issued in accordance with procedural law, at a meeting with police instructors at which the person is informed of the offence and warned not to repeat it. It is not true that Ms. Enid Amelia Luque was placed in a cell or subjected to a body search. She spent a short period of time in the police office, only in order to comply with the established procedures. Ms. Enid Amelia Luque is not a trade unionist, nor is she a union official, nor does she represent any workers\' collective. She does not have an employment relationship with any workplace. She left the country in August .\n.As regards the allegations presented by the ICFTU in its communication of  July , the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that there is no trade union called the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba in any enterprise or labour body in the entire country. The persons referred to in the ICFTU\'s letter dated  July , Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln, Jess Crdenas Lpez and Ren Jos Montero Garay, are not trade union officials, nor have they been subjected to threats and harassment. These persons have been neither nominated nor elected in any workplace in the country as representatives of any workers\' collective. Juan Guarino Martnez Guilln left the country in March .\n.As regards the alleged expulsion of a trade unionist who, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, was a member of a Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, the Government states that the inquiries carried out have ascertained that this person was transferred from his post as a disciplinary administrative measure on three occasions for unjustified absence from work and for being disrespectful to his superiors and fellow workers. These measures were imposed in accordance with the labour legislation in force, and the worker submitted to them without availing himself of the remedies laid down in the legislation. On  October , he requested leave from his workplace in order to evade another labour sanction for the same reasons. Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos has never been nominated or elected by the workers of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" sugar mill as a union official. Eduardo Lamas Campos has a criminal record.', 'whatsoever, to establish independent trade union organizations of their own choosing, outside any existing trade union structure if they so desire (Article  of the Convention), and the right to elect their representatives in full freedom (Article  of the Convention)"".\n.The complaint is contained in a communication of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  October . This organization sent additional information in a communication dated  July .\n.At its meeting of June , noting that it had not received any reply to the allegations from the Government, the Committee made an urgent appeal and indicated that in accordance with procedure it would examine the case at its next meeting even if the Government\'s reply had not been received (see th Report of the Committee, para. ).\n.The Government replied to the allegations contained in the first communication from the ICFTU in a communication dated  July .\n.Cuba has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez, one of the leaders of the Union of Workers of Cuba (USTC), was twice refused permission to leave Cuba to attend meetings of the ICFTU Committee on Human and Trade Union Rights, held in November  and June . The Government alleged that Mr. Gutierrez was still subject to a sentence resulting from his opposition to the Government; the real reason for the refusal was that for the last two years he had been trying to secure official recognition of the USTC, and had been imprisoned for that reason, but released following pressure brought to bear by the international trade union movement. The non-recognition of the USTC was examined by the Committee in its th Report (Case No. ), paras. -). In protest against the Government\'s refusal to let him leave Cuba, Mr. Gutierrez went on a hunger strike on  June, which he ended on  July, due to the solidarity expressed by the international trade union movement.\n.The ICFTU adds that according to the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC), Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC, was summoned to appear on  May  at the Department of State Security, located in Reparto Capri, in the Havana municipality of Arroyo Naranjo, by the commander of this body. Inside the aforementioned premises, the official threatened her with offensive and gross language. He told her he ""was going to make her disappear or imprison her for three years"" if she did not relinquish her organizational activities in the CTDC ranks. After this verbal aggression, a body search was carried out and Mrs. Lupe was stripped and subjected to a thorough examination. She was then threatened once again and placed in a cell which the Cuban agents use to carry out further acts of intimidation. Before she left the cell, officer Cortina delivered a stern warning to the effect that her home might be attacked by ""mobs"" throwing stones and that she might be attacked and beaten by ""neighbours from the district"".\n.The ICFTU also alleges during the week of - July  that CTDC officials were the victims of a violent demonstration by the so-called ""Rapid Response Brigades"" outside the residence of Mrs. Edith Lupe, organization secretary of the Trade Union Front of the CTDC. The dissidents Juan Jos Lpez Diaz and Welmen Lazaro Noa were also at her residence at the time. Officials of the Ministry of the Interior and members of the Communist Party of Cuba participated in this demonstration.\n.Furthermore, on  August , in the Avenida  del Rpto. Siboney, in the municipality of Playa, Havana, Mr. Lazaro Corp Yeras, general secretary of the Union of Cuban Workers (USTC) and his younger son, Ray Corp Morales, were severely beaten up with sticks by three men. Both suffered serious injuries. The ICFTU states that it has reason to believe that the aggressors had links with the Cuban security forces. This assault, the fifth in less than three months against Mr. Lazaro Corp, once again shows the flagrant violation by the Government of Cuba of internationally recognized trade union rights and principles.\n.After condemning the terrible harassment to which independent trade unionists in Cuba are subject, and which has often been denounced by the ICFTU, this organization emphasizes the total lack of freedom of association in Cuba.\n.In its communication of  July , the ICFTU alleges that the Department of State Security is severely harassing members of the National Executive Committee and the Trade Union Fronts which make up the Confederation of Democratic Workers of Cuba (CTDC). This is especially the case of Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen (president), Jesus Crdenas Lpez (vice-president) and Rene Jos Montero Garay (secretary responsible for international relations). This organization has also submitted the necessary documentation in order to obtain its legal personality but to date it does not seem to have the slightest chance of obtaining its registration.\n.The ICFTU states that on  September , at  p.m., Mr. Rene Jos Montero Garay was ordered to appear at the Unit of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) in calle Dragones esquine Lealtad, in the centre of Havana. He was questioned by several officials of this repressive body, who threatened him and warned him that both he himself and Martinez Guillen and Jesus Crdenas would be sentenced to - years\' imprisonment if they pursued their militant activities in the CTDC and if they continued their defence of the Cuban working class. Moreover, on  November , at . p.m., Messrs. Juan Guarino Martinez Guillen, President of the CTDC, and Jesus Crdenas Lpez, vice-president of the same organization, were arrested by the Department of State Security. They were taken to the nearest police station, where they were subjected to brutal and offensive interrogation.\n.The ICFTU also states that, according to its sources, Mr. Eduardo Lamas Campos, a member of the Trade Union Front of the ""Julio Antonio Mella"" central organization, in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente, was expelled from his workplace simply because he had called for improvements in working conditions and food, since the food available was both small in quantity and of very poor quality.\n.In its communication of  July , the Government explains that the delay in sending its reply was due mainly to the difficulties of locating information concerning the persons mentioned in the communication from the ICFTU, since none of these persons has trade union status, the events in question are not of a trade union nature, the persons concerned do not represent any group of workers, nor do they themselves have any employment relationship with any enterprise or labour body in Cuba, all of which places the Committee on Freedom of Association in a situation of having to deal with events which have no relationship with the laudable task which it carries out of defending trade union freedoms.\n.That being said, the Government adds that the inquiries carried out on the basis of the scant information contained in the complaint have shown that Mr. Rafael Gutierrez could not complete his plans to travel to a foreign country since at that time he was on bail pending legal proceedings against him in the criminal courts. Mr. Rafael Gutierrez subsequently left the country on the dates given by the ICFTU in its communication.\n.The Government adds that the ICFTU complaint mentions the name of Edith Lupe. This name, as well as the description of the events, are incorrect. On the basis of some of the elements contained in the communication, it was possible to determine the real identity of the person, and to ascertain what really happened. The matter concerns Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, and not Edith Lupe, as stated by the ICFTU. On  May, she was summoned to the ninth station of the National Revolutionary Police, located in Reparto Capri, and was given a warning for having carried out provocative activities against public order, in accordance with the applicable legislation. She was summoned and received in one of the offices of the above-mentioned police station, not in the Department of State Security, as erroneously stated by the ICFTU. She remained in this office for a short period of time, and was not placed in any cell or subjected to any body search. The Government adds that, according to statements made by Enid Amelia Luque Rosales, the intention of the provocative acts which were carried out in the company of four delinquents was to obtain favours and guarantees from the Section of United States Interests in Havana, with a view to obtaining a visa for permanent residence in the United States.

The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude.

Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).

In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.\n.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).\n.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) commission ad hoc failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.\n.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.\n.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the corresponding court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police after they were caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the corresponding magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).\n.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has refrained from replying to the remaining outstanding allegations as well as to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .\n.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.\n.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to furnish it with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained,"", ""attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee.

In that appeal the Committee, noting that the Government had not sent a favourable reply concerning the direct contacts mission which it had been requested to accept, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it would present a report on the substance of the cases at its subsequent meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received in due time.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee notes, once again, the Government's manifest lack of cooperation in observing the Committee's procedure and, specifically, the inexplicable failure to send almost all the information repeatedly requested by the Committee so as to enable it to determine the veracity of the outstanding allegations. The Committee has made use of urgent appeals that have been ignored, and finds itself obliged, in view of the time that has elapsed since the allegations were presented, to examine these cases once again without having the Government's observations in respect of the large majority of the allegations presented by the complainants.\n.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the aim of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union rights, both in law and in practice. The Committee is convinced that as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should formulate, so as to allow objective examination, factual replies to the allegations brought against them (First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).\n.The Committee deplores and emphasizes the seriousness of the outstanding allegations and the new allegations which refer to the murder and disappearance of a large number of trade union leaders, as well as to death threats, physical attacks, arrest and detention of workers and trade unionists, the searching of trade unionists' homes, the searching and sacking of trade union premises and acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations to the effect that it has been decided to shelve the case relating to the investigation into the criminal act of setting off explosives in the headquarters of FENASTRAS in October  which left nine persons dead and many injured, a decision which was taken in view of the impossibility of identifying the authors of this criminal act and since no group had claimed responsibility for it. The Committee considers it unacceptable in such circumstances that the investigation has been shelved because of the fact that the inquiries undertaken by a special (non-judicial) commission ad hoc failed to produce positive results. The Committee stresses the obligation on the Government to undertake the necessary measures so as to identify and punish those responsible for this condemnable attack so that the application of rapid and efficient justice serves in the re-establishment of peace.\n.As regards the new allegations presented by the ICFTU, the Committee takes note of the Government's remarks to the effect that the judicial inquiries are currently under way into the murder of Porfirio Vsquez and Miguel Angel Martnez. The Committee deplores these murders and expresses the hope that the judicial procedures that are under way will serve to clarify the facts and lead to punishment of the guilty parties. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial inquiries undertaken.\n.The Committee likewise takes note of the information sent by the Government in which it states that  members of the National Association of Agricultural Workers (ANTA) were evicted from the San Francisco de Ass Hacienda in the cantn of Ro Fro, Achaupan jurisdiction, and arrested on a charge of usurpation; however, after the corresponding court considered the case, they were released. The Committee also notes that Carlos Aguilar Garca, Norma Elizabeth Flores Portillo, Carlos Enrique Escobar Figueroa, Evelyn Jeannette Alvarado Crisstomo and Mara Cristina Alvarenga were arrested by the Hacienda police after they were caught painting anti-government slogans, but that they were released following the intervention of the corresponding magistrates' court in the absence of sufficient grounds for their further detention. The Committee considers that the detention of the mentioned trade unionists and of the  workers belonging to ANTA is an act that should not be repeated, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest of trade unionists who are involved in acts of public protest that are not offences, or their arrest without the intervention of the corresponding judicial authority with the clear intention of teaching them a lesson as is the case when subsequently no grounds for laying charges are found which would justify their having been denied their freedom, are acts amounting to serious violations of their trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).\n.The Committee draws attention to the fact that the Government has refrained from replying to the remaining outstanding allegations as well as to the large majority of the new allegations presented by the ICFTU in Cases Nos.  and .\n.As regards the large number of violent deaths (), disappearances (), physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists (see Annexes  and ), the Committee once again deplores these acts, which directly undermine the most basic human rights and the development of a free and independent trade union movement. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a situation which gives rise to a climate of violence such as that which encourages the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of trade union leaders and persons is totally incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government urgently to order a judicial inquiry aimed at shedding light on the murder and disappearance of, and the physical assaults and death threats against trade union leaders and trade unionists, to punish the guilty parties and to avoid a recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all investigations undertaken.\n.As regards the numerous arrests and detentions of trade union leaders and trade unionists ( in all), the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the arrest and detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitute a serious infringement of freedom of association and a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee once again requests the Government to release all those who might have been detained on the grounds of trade union activities and to furnish it with information on the situation of all trade union members and leaders referred to in these cases, indicating whether they are currently detained,"", ""attention to the Government's persistent negative attitude, shown since February  by its refusal to accept a direct contacts mission to the country and by its failure, despite the extreme seriousness of the allegations, to send the information required by the Committee. The Committee deplores the Government's unacceptable attitude. It urges it once again to send the information and accept the mission in question, and recommends to the Governing Body to give the widest publicity to the present report, particularly in El Salvador.\n.The Committee has examined these cases on various occasions. Case No.  was last examined at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )).

The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General\'s representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.\n.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers\' organisations.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General\'s representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General\'s representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers\' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers\' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested.

Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers\' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers\' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations']"

Consequently, this should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this regard, section  of the Regulations under the Honduran Teachers' Statute states:  All the legal provisions contained in article  of the Law shall be applied in each case by the immediate higher authority which, in turn, shall inform the corresponding authority accordingly.' The above circular letter was challenged before the State Secretariat of the Education Department and the appeal was declared not to be receivable as it did not meet the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n.The Government refutes the allegation that circular letter No. -SE-, of  February , ordered the non-renewal of union leave for certain teachers in particular, such as the SINPRODOH officials, Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte and Mr Santos Blas Oviedo Rivas. The Government explains that action was taken to investigate whether the teachers had abandoned their jobs in the education centres, following failures or abandonment on the part of many teachers, and the constant complaints made by children s parents, in observance of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the Government clarifies that the leave requested by Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA, was granted.\n.The Government states that, while Mr Armando Gmez Torres, President of PRICPHMA, Mr Orlando Meja Velsquez, Secretary-General of PRICPHMA, and Mr Cesar Augusto Ramos, Secretary for Legal Affairs of PRICPHMA, held posts as teachers' representatives and were on paid union leave, they illegally obtained new teaching positions in schools where they never reported for work. Furthermore, specific records show that on ,  and  February , none of the three teachers reported for work. Mr Jury Hernndez Troches, Secretary for the Environment of PRICPHMA, committed serious misconduct consisting of dereliction of duty from  February  onwards. Mr Edwin Emilio Oliva, President of COLPROSUMAH, Mr Martin Suazo Sandoval, Secretary for Advertising of COLPROSUMAH, and Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte of the SINPRODOH also committed serious misconduct consisting of dereliction of duty, which is why they were dismissed.\n.The Government emphasizes that the leave requested by Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA, was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the PRICPHMA executive board. In the case of Mr Walter Edgardo Rivera, Secretary for Advertising of PRICPHMA, the Court of Appeal for Administrative Disputes ordered a stay of proceedings prior to the request being resolved. Mr Murillo and Mr Rivera were not sanctioned and still have an employment relationship with the State Secretariat of the Education Department.\n.The Government states that some representatives returned to their workplaces when the regional departments decided not to extend their paid leave, including Mr Edgardo Antonio Casaa, President of COPRUMH; Mr Otto Omar Cayetano, Vice-President of COPRUMH; Mr Oscar Geovanny Alemn, Secretary for Finance of COPRUMH, Mr Carlos Hernn Izaguirre, Legal Adviser of COPRUMH, and Ms Denia Esmeralda Galindo, Secretary for Disputes of COPRUMH.\n.Concerning the actions for constitutional protection (amparo), filed against the State Secretariat of the Education Department by the teachers' representatives whose union leave was not renewed, in connection with the administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted against various teachers, including those of the SINPRODOH, it has emerged that the Supreme Court of Justice has declared them to be not receivable, since the administrative channels have not been exhausted prior to the judicial remedies. Concerning the request submitted by Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla for , the Government states that the Director of the education department of Yoro requested a report from the department secretariat indicating how many years Mr Alfaro Bonilla had obtained leave for. The response was that the period was from  to  (that is eight consecutive years). Nevertheless, section () of the Labour Code states:  Where a worker holds union management positions, the leave shall last for as long as the worker stays in his post. The employer shall be forbidden to pay a salary for this purpose. The leave in question shall be requested by the individual union organization ... .' For that reason, Decision No. -, of  February , declared the request for paid leave to be non-receivable, under section  of the Regulations of the Honduran Teachers' Statute which states:  All the legal provisions contained in article  of the law (the Honduran Teachers' Statute) shall be applied in each case by the immediate higher authority.' Decision No. /DOS/ issued by the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments refers to the SINPRODOH statutes, section  of which grants a period of three years, with re-election for a further period to any post, with a total or partial break of three years before applying for a new post on the central executive board. Mr Alfaro Bonilla completed his two periods on  November  and cannot therefore continue to obtain paid union leave. The leave refused is that which corresponds to the post of director of the Jos Trinidad Reyes school, located in the village of Las Delicias, El Negrito municipality, department of Yoro, for which reason he is expected to report to the education centre. The Government is unaware whether Mr Alfaro Bonilla occupies other posts within national or international union organizations. Having finalized the process, the regional department of Yoro issued Decision No. -D.D.E.Y.-, whereby Mr Alfaro Bonilla was dismissed for abandoning his post and an order to issue an annulment agreement was given owing to the dismissal of the director of the Jos Trinidad Reyes education centre. On  May , an appeal was lodged against that decision and the case was submitted to the State Secretariat of the Education Department on  June .\n.As regards the money owed by the Government to teachers, the Government recognizes that the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department. The Government explains that the delay (that is the failure to pay on the th day of each month) affected teachers at the national level and that their unrest was understandable. Faced with this situation, the State Secretariat of the Education Office issued Decision No.  SE , of  December , which temporarily suspended the voluntary deductions for teachers to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as those of INPREMA, the IHSS, union contributions and other legal and court fees.\n.Regarding the teacher selection boards, the Government clarifies that the State Secretariat of the Education Department began a  teacher reorganization' process, which aimed to return teachers assigned to other education establishments to the schools where they had been originally appointed. As a result of this process, needs and vacancies were identified, which led to the redistribution of posts based on the information gathered. In June , guidelines were issued on how to set up regional selection boards in regions where the reorganization process had been completed and where there were vacancies. The teacher reorganization process was concluded in , the boards were set up and representatives from teachers' unions have now been included. The Government adds that the competitive examinations have regained their public status, with many of their stages being conducted in open interviews.\n.As regards the allegations relating to the report requested on the amounts, use and handling of the funds received as a result of the transferred deductions, under circular letter No. -SE-, of  March , the Government states that this was sent to the six presidents of the teachers' unions belonging to the FOMH, requesting them to report on the amounts, use and handling of funds received as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations. For many years, the Secretariat acted as a management body channelling those deductions, following requests made by teachers. Therefore, as a result of the failure to submit the report in question, the State Secretariat of the Education Department reserves the right to decide whether to continue to authorize the transfer of those deductions. The circular letter referred to was challenged before the State Secretariat of the Education Department. The appeal was declared non-receivable, since circular letter No. -SE- does not constitute an administrative act deriving from an administrative procedure, in accordance with section  of the General Act of Public Administration; it is not a general act which may be challenged, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Administrative Procedure Act, nor is it an administrative decision issued by the administration hearing cases in the first or second instance, pursuant to section  of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n.The Committee notes that in this case, the complaints form part of a long dispute between teachers'"", ""Statute was suspended by means of Decree-Law No. -, dated  October . EI and the FOMH emphasize that the latter Decree-Law orders the de-indexation of the minimum salary, as a result of which the minimum salary cannot henceforth be used as a reference for an automatic increase in salaries. On  May , the SINPRODOH lodged an administrative appeal with the State Secretariat of the Education Department, representing , teachers, prior to legal action for violation of the Honduran Teachers' Statute, demanding payment of the salary increases for the years in arrears.\n.The complainant organizations allege that the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments decided to declare the protest movements illegal and threaten to sanction the teachers by means of dismissal. More than  teachers were sanctioned in the form of suspension without pay for a period of six months. Through the State Secretariat of the Education Department, the Government issued Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , which sanctioned hundreds of teachers who participated in the protest movement by means of a deduction in their wages and dismissal from their posts. EI and the FOMH allege that the sanction was published before the sanctioned teachers had the opportunity to be heard in court. On  October , the SINPRODOH brought an action for constitutional protection (amparo) in the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice against Executive Decision No. -SE-. The Chamber declared the appeal to be receivable and ordered that it should be heard by an ordinary court; the action was brought before the Civil Court of Administrative Disputes for annulment of the administrative act. The action was received and the legal proceedings are under way.\n.The complainant organizations denounce the fact that the Government ordered the suspension of deductions in union dues for teachers' organizations, in Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  December . EI and the FOMH state that the first suspension period began in March  and ended in March ; the second suspension period began in January  and continues to date. On  December , the SINPRODOH brought an action for constitutional protection (amparo) in the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice against the executive decision in question. The Chamber declared the appeal to be receivable and ordered that it should be heard by an ordinary court; the action was brought before the Civil Court of Administrative Disputes for annulment of the administrative act. The action is in the process of being received.\n.In addition, EI and the FOMH denounce the adoption of Executive Decision No.  SE , of  July , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or class suspensions. The State Secretariat of the Education Department sends inspectors to each assembly lawfully convened by the organizations, so that they may produce a record of proceedings. The records are used to impose salary deductions or to suspend teachers.\n.The complainant organizations denounce the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid leave:(a) FLATEC states that the State Secretariat of the Education Department ordered, in circular letter No. -SE-, of  February , that the paid leave of Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, Mr Santos Blas Oviedo Rivas and Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte, SINPRODOH officials, not be renewed, following the submission of the request on  January  to the Trujillo district education department and regional education departments of El Paraso and Yoro. Moreover, the State Secretariat of the Education Department ordered that these persons report to work and cease their union administrative duties. On  February , the SINPRODOH challenged the letter before the State Secretariat of the Education Department; to date no decision has been taken on the matter. Subsequently, the State Secretariat of the Education Department ordered the recording of acts of abandonment of their posts by Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, Mr Santos Blas Oviedo Rivas and Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte, for failing to give classes on ,  and  February . Those acts were challenged by the SINPRODOH, under a previous decision of the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments, as those officials, having been elected for the period ' , did not have to report for duty until February . Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte was summoned to a dismissal hearing on  April , and FLATEC states that the State Secretariat of the Education Department had ordered that he be dismissed. Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla was summoned to a dismissal hearing on  April , and FLATEC states that the State Secretariat of the Education Department had already announced his dismissal. The acts of abandonment recorded against Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla were challenged in the district education department of El Negrito, Yoro.(b) EI and the FOMH add that paid union leave was also denied to Mr Armando Gmez Torres, President of PRICPHMA; Mr Orlando Meja Velsquez, Secretary-General of PRICPHMA; Mr Cesar Augusto Ramos, Secretary for Legal Affairs of PRICPHMA; Mr Jury Hernndez Troches, Secretary for the Environment of PRICPHMA; Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA; Mr Walter Edgardo Rivera, Secretary for Advertising of PRICPHMA; Mr Elder Zavala, Secretary for Pedagogical Affairs of PRICPHMA; Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA; Mr Edwin Emilio Oliva, President of COLPROSUMAH; Mr Martin Suazo Sandoval, Secretary for Advertising of COLPROSUMAH; Mr Edgardo Antonio Casaa, President of COPRUMH; Mr Otto Omar Cayetano, Vice-President of COPRUMH; Mr Oscar Geovanny Alemn, Secretary for Finance of COPRUMH; Mr Carlos Hernn Izaguirre, Legal Adviser of COPRUMH; and Ms Denia Esmeralda Galindo, Secretary for Disputes of COPRUMH. On  April , Mr Armando Gmez Torres, President of PRICPHMA; Mr Orlando Meja Velsquez, Secretary-General of PRICPHMA; Mr Cesar Augusto Ramos, Secretary for Legal Affairs of PRICPHMA; Mr Jury Hernndez Troches, Secretary for the Environment of PRICPHMA; Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA; Mr Walter Edgardo Rivera, Secretary for Advertising of PRICPHMA; Mr Elder Zavala, Secretary for Pedagogical Affairs of PRICPHMA; and Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA were dismissed. On  April , Mr Edwin Emilio Oliva, President of COLPROSUMAH; Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, President of SINPRODOH; and Mr Gaeri Jonathan Duarte of SINPRODOH were dismissed.\n.FLATEC denounces the fact that the Government is in arrears for the payment to teachers of salary increases for , ,  and . As a result, teachers' representatives instigated union action by means of protests and other movements; those protest actions were suppressed by the police forces.\n.EI and the FOMH denounce the unilateral suspension, by the Secretary of State of the Education Department, of the Teacher Selection and Competitive Recruitment Boards, which hinders the mobility of workers.\n.FLATEC states that, in circular-letter No. -SE-, the State Secretariat of the Education Department gave the SINPRODOH five working days to submit a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds received as a result of the deductions transferred. On  March , the SINPRODOH challenged the letter in question before the State Secretariat of the Education Department; to date, the matter has not been resolved.\n.Furthermore, FLATEC denounces the fact that the Higher Court of Auditors notified Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla, Mr Lorenzo Snchez Rivas, Mr Jos Armando Villela Paisano and Mr Leonel Eraldo Amara Sorto, SINPRODOH officials, of civil liability claims for ,,. Honduran lempiras (HNL). That compensation is the result of the alleged signing of a negotiation agreement, resetting the levels of pensions for retired teachers affiliated to the SINPRODOH, with the Government. The SINPRODOH challenged the civil liability claims against Mr Bertn Alfaro Bonilla and Mr Lorenzo Snchez Rivas; to date, the matter has not been resolved. Mr Jos Armando Villela Paisano and Mr Leonel Eraldo Amara Sorto are awaiting notification.\n.In addition, EI and the FOMH denounce the workplace harassment faced by Mr Franklin Padilla of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Honduras (COPEMH), and Mr Oscar Recarte, Secretary for Pedagogical Affairs and President of COPEMH, respectively.\n.In its communication of  September , the Government states that its actions are not directed against the SINPRODOH. Furthermore, in its communication of  May , the Government emphasizes that the State ensures that teachers' labour rights are observed and demands that teachers discharge their duties, particularly those relating to the right to education for children and young people.\n.As regards the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, the Government states that her death was caused by a young, reckless driver, who hit her while driving against the flow of traffic. A forensic report of the Public Prosecutor s Office concluded that Ms Velsquez Rodrguez died from a blow caused by the impact of her falling onto the roadway. It excludes the possibility that, prior to Ms Velsquez Rodrguez s fall, she had been hit by an object designed for use by the military or police.\n.As for the detention of  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, the Government explains that they were arrested for assaulting several police officers with mortar rockets. The"", ""organizations and the Government, which gave rise to protest movements and strikes, during the period from  to , caused by the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute and the delays in the payment of salaries in arrears, among other things.\n.Similarly, the Committee observes that the allegations refer to: () the death of a trade union activist on  March , while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers, for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their arrest while participating in a peaceful demonstration; () the exclusion of teachers' organizations from the higher authority of the administration of INPREMA; () the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, and its de-indexation from the minimum salary (preventing the continuing use of the minimum salary as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries); () the failure to pay salary increases from  to  and the suppression of the protests to which this gave rise; () the declaration of the protest movements as illegal by the administrative authority and the resulting sanctions imposed on more than  teachers; () the suspension of the deductions in union fees for teachers' organizations; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  July , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspensions of classes; () the refusal of requests for renewal of union leave; () the unilateral suspension of Teacher Selection and Competitive Recruitment Boards; () the request for a report on the amounts, use and handling of the funds obtained as a result of the deductions transferred to teachers' organizations; () the civil liability claims brought against four SINPRODOH officials, for an amount of HNL,,.; and () the professional persecution of two members of the COPEMH.\n.The Committee notes that the Government states that its actions are not directed against the SINPRODOH. It also notes the following statements by the Government: () the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a young, reckless driver, who hit her while driving against the flow of traffic. The forensic report of the Public Prosecutor s office excludes the possibility that, prior to her fall, she had been hit by an object designed for use by the military or police; () the teachers were arrested for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association for assaulting several police officers with mortar rockets. Due process was respected at all times and, to date, no teacher has been convicted for the aforementioned facts; () the reforms outlined in Decree No.  , of  December , containing the National Social Welfare Institute for Teachers Act were based on actuarial studies carried out by the CNBS, and were disseminated among the teachers' unions in ; () Decree-Law No. -, of  October , suspended the economic regimes established in the different professional statutes, as they are fiscal measures which served as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries, to the detriment of the budgets of centralized and decentralized state institutions; in this respect, the administrative appeal lodged by the SINPRODOH was not successful, since the country s financial situation did not allow for further and greater commitments beyond those contained in the National General Income and Expenditure Budget; () the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, and this delay (that is the failure to pay on the th day of each month) affected teachers at the national level and their unrest was understandable, which was why the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions for teachers to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as union contributions and other legal and court fees. The State Secretariat of the Education Department has acted for many years as a management body to channel the deductions for teachers' unions, in line with requests made by teachers. It sent the circular letter to the six presidents of teachers' organizations belonging to the FOMH, requesting them to report on the amounts, use and handling of funds received. Voluntary deductions were resumed for the teachers' unions that had submitted the reports requested, namely the COPRUMH and the COLPEDAGOGOSH; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  June , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspension of classes, was motivated by the desire to fulfil the right to education and the minimum number of class days; () the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments has declared illegal the strikes and protests launched by teachers' representatives in the past two years; consequently, pursuant to national legislation on the disciplinary regime, Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , was issued, imposing sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be; () the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid union leave made by certain teachers is based on national legislation, which should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this respect, there was a case in which the request for leave was indeed granted (Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA), and another case in which the request for leave was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the executive board (Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA). In most cases, the requests for renewal of paid union leave were refused because the time limit set under the regulations of the teacher s organization concerned had been exceeded; () the State Secretariat of the Education Department began a  teacher reorganization' process, which aimed to return teachers assigned to other education establishments to the schools where they had been originally appointed. As a result, needs and vacancies were identified, which led to the redistribution of posts based on the information gathered. The reorganization process was concluded in , the teacher selection boards have now been set up, and representatives from teachers' unions have been included.\n.The Committee notes with profound concern the seriousness of the allegations which include the death of a union activist, criminal proceedings and mass sanctions relating to union activities, and also significant restrictions on the union rights of officials.\n.Regarding the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, the Committee observes that, while this highly regrettable event occurred during a demonstration organized by the teachers' organizations of Honduras, it does not seem, according to government statements, to be the result of a violation of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information in their possession on this allegation and in particular whether her death was, as the Government states, due to a car accident and to indicate whether anyone has been charged or detained in this regard.\n.As regards the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest, while participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee takes note of the statements made by the Government that they assaulted several police officers by throwing mortar rockets at them. The Committee emphasizes that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee regrets the acts of violence that occurred during the demonstration and urges the Government to provide information without delay on the specific acts for which they are being prosecuted, on the status of the legal proceedings instituted and, where applicable, the outcome.\n.Concerning the dispute which is the subject of this complaint, the Committee notes the allegations relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, under section  of Decree-Law No. -, of  October , and also notes the economic arguments put forward by the Government. The Committee also notes that section  of the above Decree-Law states that:  within a period of  days and subject to negotiation with union organizations, the executive authority shall fix the adjustment to the base salary of public servants governed by special laws or professional statutes, in accordance with the state salary policy, without this increasing the collateral benefits'  As regards the alleged failure to pay the salary increases, the Committee observes that the Government acknowledges that the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department and that, in view of the situation, the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions from teachers for Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as those""]"

According to the ICFTU, hundreds of people, including many trade unionists, were murdered or disappeared following the coup d\'tat. Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed. The few trade union offices which stayed open were only able to do so because they remained extremely discreet. All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.\n.The list of specific cases provided by the ICFTU is, according to this organization, in no way exhaustive in light of the fact that obtaining information and testimony in Haiti was extremely difficult because of the risk of jeopardizing the safety of the people concerned. These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On  October , Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation\'s premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on  September  and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November , army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin\'s remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr Franois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation\'s headquarters have been closed.- On  November  soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On  January , Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on  January  as a consequence of this torture.- On  March , Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On  March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students\' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On  May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students\' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On  May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women\'s branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of  May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July  in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists\' union, AJH.
