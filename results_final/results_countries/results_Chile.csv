0,".The complaint is contained in communications dated February  (received  March ) and  February  from the Lan Express Cabin Crew Union ' LATAM Chile (STCLE), supported by the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) and the Single Central Organization of Workers of Chile (CUT).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  March and  August .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that, in a collective bargaining process, Transporte Areo SA or Lan Express (hereinafter the enterprise) was guilty of anti-union discrimination by rejecting as illegal the complainant s decision to end a strike and to accept the enterprise s final offer.
.The complainant states that: (i) on  February , the STCLE launched a collective bargaining process, with the enterprise giving its response on  February ; (ii) a legal dispute arose over a clause in the contract ' which the enterprise wanted to remove ' establishing that any worker who joins the union will become a beneficiary of the collective instrument, a dispute in which the Labour Directorate and the courts ruled in favour of the union; (iii) round table negotiations began, which were unsuccessful and, after the deadlines had passed, the enterprise made its final offer on  March  (an offer that was neither withdrawn nor revoked by the enterprise); (iv) after unsuccessful mediation by the labour inspectorate, the strike began on  April ; (v) at that stage the enterprise made a new offer, which was not accepted by the union s assembly; (vi) on  April , the enterprise began a campaign to encourage the striking workers to halt their action, with the aim of breaking up the union and excluding them from the bargaining process; (vii) against this background, the enterprise refused to meet with the union s negotiating committee and only undertook to promote the individual reinstatement of workers; (viii) given the time that had elapsed and the intransigence of the enterprise, the STCLE s assembly decided to accept the enterprise s final offer and end the strike ' the enterprise and the labour inspectorate were informed of this on  April ; (ix) on  April the enterprise issued a statement indicating that  unfortunately the way in which the union reportedly ended the strike does not comply with current legislation, which is why the enterprise is consulting with the Labour Directorate to obtain a ruling on the legality of the union s actions' and specifying that, in the meantime, the enterprise could not consider the strike to be over; (x) the head of the Labour Directorate, in response to the enterprise s request, summoned the parties on  April and informed the union that the enterprise s submission would be forwarded so that it could give its opinion; (xi) however, without waiting to hear the union s arguments, in the afternoon of the same day official communication No.  was issued on  April , signed by the head of the Labour Directorate s legal department, which stated that, as the union s assembly had rejected the enterprise s final offer, the union had not complied with the requirement to end the strike and consequently its action was illegal and the strike should be considered as still ongoing. This administrative decision underscored that, under the Labour Code, the main legal modalities for ending regulated collective bargaining are the signing of the collective agreement by both parties and the right to each worker s individual reinstatement during the strike under the terms and conditions of the employer s final offer; and (xii) through this action, the administrative authority, in failing to respect due process, interfered in collective bargaining, by ruling that, although the union had decided to end the strike, the strike continued (which, the complainant asserts, was in the enterprise s interest).
.The complainant indicates that the administrative authority s ruling forced the union to bring the case before the courts: (i) proceedings for constitutional protection (amparo) were filed against the Labour Directorate (which was rejected by the Court of Appeal on  July , a decision upheld by the Supreme Court, on a matter of form ' it was considered that the protection should be given by the labour judge); (ii) in this regard, an application was filed for a labour judge to rule on the legality of the decision to end the strike and sign the enterprise s final offer and, on  September , the First Chamber of the Santiago Labour Court rejected the application, carrying out a grammatical analysis of the legislation, considering that there was no express rule authorizing a union to accept the enterprise s final offer once the strike was approved ' this ruling was subject to an appeal for annulment before the Santiago Court of Appeal; and (iii) in these circumstances, the contested administrative act remained in force, meaning that the strike could not be ended (the union instructed the unionized workers to return to work in order to avoid serious financial losses. However, three union leaders have remained on strike, without pay (for nine months as of the date the complaint was filed), with a consequent loss of health coverage due to outstanding payments owed to the private insurance company, as well as problems in carrying out their union activities because the enterprise has made it difficult for them to access their usual workplaces to meet with union members.
.The complainant considers that the enterprise s actions and the contested administrative decision hinder the collective bargaining process and effectively prevent the unions from exercising their right to strike. It considers that these are discriminatory anti-union acts that favour individual bargaining (for a small group of workers because they stopped striking earlier and for whom, in the enterprise s view, the final offer had not expired) over collective bargaining (the enterprise did not allow the union to accept the final offer, nor did it offer the terms and conditions of the offer to the unionized workers who ended the strike later). The complainant therefore considers that the authority s actions in support of the enterprise s position ran counter to the State s obligation to encourage collective bargaining. The complainant requests that its right to oppose the end of the strike be recognized, that the alleged actions be determined as anti-union practices, and that the three union leaders who were forced to remain on strike be reinstated and receive their unpaid wages.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government sent in response the observations of the head of the Labour Directorate, who indicates that: (i) the complaint is related to an application for a declaratory judgment filed by the complainant against the enterprise in order to determine that the end of the strike called by the union on  April  was legal; (ii) the First Chamber of the Santiago Labour Court rejected the application when hearing the case; (iii) however, on  July , the Santiago Court of Appeal annulled the contested ruling and issued a replacement ruling accepting the application; (iv) subsequently, the enterprise filed an appeal for unification of jurisprudence on  July  before the Supreme Court; (v) these proceedings were suspended due to the filing of an application for unconstitutionality of sections  and  of the Labour Code ' an action that was rejected by the Constitutional Court in a ruling dated  March ; and (vi) the suspended proceedings were resumed, and on  April , the Supreme Court issued a ruling declaring the appeal for unification of jurisprudence filed by the enterprise inadmissible. It should also be noted that the Labour Directorate was not a party to the aforementioned legal proceedings.
.The Court of Appeal s ruling, which therefore resolved the matter, ruled in favour of the complainant union and established that: (i) the end of the strike agreed by the union on  April  is legal; and (ii) the employer s final offer was in force at the time it was signed by the complainant union, meaning that it constitutes the collective instrument applicable to the parties between  April  and  March . This means that it is also applicable to the workers who were reinstated individually (stopped striking), given that, as a result, such reinstatement was not in accordance with the law. The Court of Appeal noted that it can only be concluded that, as strike action is a legal remedy available to workers, the sole holder of this right is, in this case, the union. The decision to end the strike and return to work therefore always falls to the union. The Court also concluded that it can be considered that existing legislation (Act No. .) grants unions the exercise of the right to strike and what that entails, including ending a strike under the regulated procedure. The Court also considered in its",0,2019,Chile
1,"opinion that the entire collective bargaining process relies on the contracting parties acting in good faith and that the bedrock of this type of procedure presupposes that its participants avoid any conduct that would hinder their mutual understanding, with a view to a fair and peaceful solution. Against this background, the Court considered that collective autonomy should prevail. Such autonomy was evident in the employer s proposal (final offer), which cannot be deemed to have precluded or lost its validity, given that the workers who decided to return to work individually adhered to its terms and conditions and the workers' negotiating committee expressed their agreement to them in order to end the strike. The Court of Appeal found that concluding the collective process through such agreement was consistent with an interpretation underpinning the collective agreement as an expression of freedom of association and that the concurrence of wills over the final offer was conducive to the resolution of the dispute and reinforced union and collective autonomy.
.By means of a communicatin dated  August , the Governement indicates that the main issue that gave rise to the complaint has been resolved within the framework of the country s institutions and that it has no additional information to add.
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that, in a collective bargaining process, the enterprise was guilty of anti-union discrimination by rejecting as illegal the complainant s decision to end a strike and to accept the enterprise s final offer. The complainant claims that the union s right to end the strike should be recognized, and that the three union leaders who remained on strike following the enterprise s rejection should be reinstated and their lost wages paid.
.The Committee notes that, following the filing of the complaint, the courts of law ruled on the case in favour of the complainant union, finding that: (i) the ending of the strike agreed by the union on  April  was legal; and (ii) the employer s final offer was in force at the time it was signed by the complainant union, so that it constitutes the applicable collective instrument.
.The Committee notes that, in ruling on the issue, the deciding court ' the Court of Appeal ' found that, as strike action is a legal remedy available to workers, the sole holder of this right is, in this case, the trade union. The decision to end the strike and return to work therefore always falls to the union. The Committee also notes that the Court of Appeal also found that concluding the collective process through such agreement was consistent with an interpretation underpinning the collective agreement as an expression of freedom of association and that the concurrence of wills over the final offer was conducive to the resolution of the dispute and reinforced union and collective autonomy.
.The Committee takes due note of the of the Court of Appeal s ruling and notes that the right of workers' organizations to organize their activities must include the possibility of deciding to end collective actions that they have initiated.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the information provided does not specify whether the three union leaders who remained on strike following the enterprise s decision not to accept the end of the strike by the trade union had been reinstated and whether the wages they had not been paid had been reimbursed. The Committee trusts that this was the case.The Committee s recommendations
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:(a) The Committee trusts that the three union leaders who had remained on strike following the enterprise s decision not to accept the end of the strike by the trade union were reinstated and the wages they had not been paid were reimbursed.(b) The Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.",2,2019,Chile
2,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Workers' Trade Union No.  of the El Mercurio S.A. newspaper enterprise dated  May . Subsequently, on  September , the Single Confederation of Trade Unions of Chile (CUT) sent a communication supporting the complaint.
.The Government sent its observations by communications of  October  and  April .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  May , the complainants indicate that on  February  the El Mercurio S.A. newspaper enterprise ( the enterprise' , the largest print media enterprise in the country, notified  workers from the production area that their contracts would be terminated. Of those workers,  were members of Trade Union No. , who represent more than  per cent of the laid-off workers and  per cent of the union s  members. The complainants indicate that the collective agreement in force with the said trade union was due to expire on  May  and that the dismissals were intended to instil fear in the workers and prevent any possible work stoppages during the collective bargaining process.
.The complainants indicate that, although the enterprise relied on article  of the Labour Code (enterprise requirements) to justify the dismissals ' more specifically the decision to outsource the printing of products by contracting a printing works that allegedly provides a service at lower cost and with higher quality ' the printing works is one that was set up recently and has no other clients, and that it is untrue that it has greater efficiency and quality standards. The complainants indicate that the notice letters sent by the enterprise to the workers do not specify the grounds for the decision and that the dismissals are therefore wrongful. The complainants further allege that the dismissals were notified in an intimidating manner, as the security personnel identified the dismissed workers from photographs and prevented them from entering the premises. In addition, they indicate that more than half of the workers lodged complaints on the grounds of anti-union practices and sought to have the dismissals declared null and void.
.Furthermore, the complainants indicate that the legal time limit to present the draft text for the new collective agreement was due to expire on  April , and Trade Union No.  therefore submitted its draft on  April; one hour later, it received an email from the enterprise saying that bargaining was suspended because on  March the enterprise had submitted a request to the Labour Directorate to designate the minimum services and emergency teams in the event of a strike, in accordance with the provisions of Act No.  on the modernization of the labour relations system. The complainants indicate that, under that Act, prior to a collective bargaining process, the parties must determine and designate the minimum services and the corresponding emergency teams; to that end, the employer must make a proposal to the unions, who have a time limit to respond and reach an agreement. A collective bargaining process cannot be started in that period.
.The complainants also indicate that even if the enterprise s obligation under the Labour Code to make a proposal to the union on the minimum services is not indicated explicitly in transitional article  of Act No. , that article provides that the minimum services must be agreed by the enterprise and the trade unions. The complainants indicate that, in the present case, the enterprise requested the designation of the minimum services, arguing that there was no agreement with the union, but that the reason why there was no agreement was that the enterprise had not made any proposal to the union. The complainants also state that the Labour Directorate should not have admitted the enterprise s request, as by so doing, it allowed the enterprise to unilaterally suspend the collective bargaining. They indicate that Trade Union No.  requested the National Labour Director to clarify that the intention of the Act is that the employer should make a proposal to the unions concerning the arrangements for minimum services and that, if it does not do so, the request to designate minimum services must be rejected.
.Moreover, the complainants allege that the enterprise systematically failed to comply with the collective agreement made with Trade Union No. , which was signed on  October  and was in force until  May . They indicate that, despite the repeated letters sent by the union and the various meetings that were held, on  October  the executive board of the union submitted a request for mediation to the National Director of Labour in relation to the non-compliance with the collective agreement and the enterprise declined to attend the meetings and participate in the voluntary mediation.
.In its communications of  October  and  April , the Government sent its observations as well as those of the enterprise. The enterprise indicates that its main line of business is creating newspaper content and that its funding mainly comes from advertising revenue. It indicates that, in recent years, the media industry has been experiencing financial difficulties and that the press specifically has been seriously affected by the diversification of advertising platforms, moving away from traditional newspapers and print magazines to new and multiple channels for displaying advertisements. As from , the enterprise had seen a significant drop in revenue and in that context had adopted a series of measures with a view to reducing costs and maintaining the sustainability of the business. The enterprise indicates that between  and  its revenue dropped by . per cent, despite it having implemented various types of measures, and that in  and , it underwent restructuring which meant that more than  people lost their job.
.The enterprise states that the sustained loss of advertising revenue, in a market characterized by the emergence of new advertising platforms, resulted in the enterprise taking a decision that it had been contemplating for several years: to improve the printing infrastructure, which meant that it had to decide between making a large investment in new equipment or beginning a process of gradually outsourcing the printing. The enterprise indicates that it received advice from a renowned investment bank and that, in view of the lack of other newspaper printing presses in the country except for one belonging to a competitor, it was the investment bank, through one of its subsidiaries, that in  began the process of setting up a printing works. On  December , the enterprise signed a service contract with that printing works, which began to operate two months later. The enterprise indicates that the decision to outsource part of the printing of its products has been positive, as the print quality is higher and it has created cost efficiencies. The enterprise clarifies that it does not own the printing works.
.The enterprise states that the decision to outsource part of its production operations was made on economic grounds and meant that an internal restructuring was necessary, particularly the area of production; as there were no other services or areas available to which the workers affected could be reassigned, it was necessary to downsize the production area. It indicates that, on the same day that the external printing works began operations, on  February , it notified  workers in the production area that they were being laid off. The stated grounds for the layoffs were  Requirements of the undertaking, establishment or service'  pursuant to article  of the Labour Code, and the letters of notice sent to the workers explained thoroughly the economic reasons that had obligated the enterprise to reduce costs and outsource part of the printing of its products and, consequently, to lay off the workers from the production area.
.The enterprise indicates that, in January , before the layoffs had taken place, it had met with Trade Union No.  to discuss matters on which they agree for the new collective agreement and that the president of the union voiced concern that there would be layoffs among his union s members, as he had information about the outsourcing of the newspaper printing. The enterprise indicates that it made a proposal to the union to sign a new collective agreement, which included a fund for the laid-off workers for a period of four months after the signature of the collective agreement. The enterprise indicates that the demands made by the union far exceeded the offer that it had made, and hence the negotiation was unsuccessful.
.The enterprise also indicates that on  February, the day on which the workers were notified of the termination of their contracts, it provided facilities to receive the workers and carry out the related administrative tasks, and met with the executive boards of the trade unions whose members were affected and explained that, with a view to ending the contractual relationship",0,2017,Chile
3,"in a sound manner, it would offer those workers who were in agreement with the contract termination an additional financial incentive over and above what it was legally obligated to offer, advice on social security and a plan for finding a new job. The enterprise indicates that at that meeting, one of the union officials asked whether the incentive was negotiable and, when the enterprise replied that it was prepared to consider alternatives, the trade union said that it would send a proposal that evening, which ultimately did not happen.
.The enterprise indicates that a total of  workers opted to sign settlements and receive the benefits to which they were entitled under the law and the collective agreements in force, as well as the additional incentives; a further  workers included in the documents that they reserved the right to subsequently take legal action. The Government informs the Committee that a decision has already been handed down in some of those proceedings, that in some proceedings a conciliation agreement has been reached, and that in other proceedings either there has not yet been a decision or an action for annulment has been brought which has not yet been resolved. The Government indicates that in all of the court cases brought by the union in which a decision has been handed down, for a total of  workers, the layoffs were found to be lawful and the complaints of infringement of freedom of association were dismissed.
.The Government provided a copy of a number of decisions in which the labour courts noted that the outsourcing process had begun well before the collective bargaining process, that production was being outsourced with a view to increasing competitiveness and that it did not aim to weaken the union, either directly or indirectly, also taking into account the fact that the enterprise has high levels of unionization among all categories of employees. Furthermore, they considered that the decision to lay off the workers mainly from the production area does not appear to be an arbitrary one nor intended to weaken the union directly or indirectly, in that the enterprise was unaware of the union membership of the workers affected ' although it could assume a high level of unionization in the area ' and that it could not be demonstrated that the union members were laid off with the deliberate intent of weakening the union either directly or indirectly in view of an imminent collective bargaining process.
.With regard to the request to designate the minimum services and emergency teams, the enterprise indicates that transitional article  of Act No. , which was published on  September  and has been in force since  April , provides that, as from the publication of the Act, enterprises and trade union organizations may designate the minimum services and emergency teams by common accord, and that where collective bargaining is due to commence within two months of the entry into force of the Act and there is no agreement on the designation of the minimum services and emergency teams, the employer must notify the competent Regional Labour Directorate within a time limit of  days starting from the fourth month following the publication of the Act. The enterprise indicates that the negotiation with the union was due to begin between April and May , and therefore the request to designate minimum services was due to be submitted by  March , on which date the enterprise submitted the request to the Labour Directorate.
.The Government indicates that the right to request the designation of minimum services and emergency teams must be exercised with strict adherence to the principle of good faith prevailing throughout the collective bargaining process, such that it is not possible for the administrative authority to determine whether the exercise of that right constitutes an anti-union practice, because only the courts may characterize conduct as an anti-union practice. The foregoing is without prejudice to the responsibility of the Labour Directorate to report to the competent court any incidents it considers to constitute anti-union or unfair practices so that it may examine them. The Government adds that the entry into force of the Act may have given rise to some situations requiring adjustments through the administrative and/or legislative channels, all of which is currently under review with a view to creating greater certainty on the matter.
.The Government indicates that on  May , the Oriente Regional Labour Directorate declared the work of security guards to be the only minimum service, against which the enterprise lodged a hierarchical appeal, which was rejected. The Government also indicates that the designation of the minimum service allowed the enterprise and the trade union to proceed with their negotiations and that on  September  the current collective agreement was signed, which is in force until  September .
.With regard to the purported  conscious, repeated and systematic' non-compliance with the collective agreement signed on  October , the enterprise emphasizes that the complainant organizations did not specify which clauses the enterprise had allegedly violated and the nature of the alleged non-compliance. The enterprise indicates that the union sought voluntary mediation before the Labour Directorate to discuss provisions of the collective agreement in the light of various differences in opinion on the application of certain benefits and that the enterprise agreed to participate in that process. It indicates that it met with an official of the Labour Directorate and coordinated the submission of information concerning the matters that the union wished to address. However, the day before the meeting that was scheduled on  January , the Labour Directorate informed the enterprise that the trade union organization had decided to unilaterally change the agenda of the mediation and that it wished to address other topics; consequently, as it was a voluntary process, the enterprise decided not to continue with the mediation.
.The Committee observes that in the present case, the complainant organizations report anti-union dismissals, and the suspension of the collective bargaining process and non-compliance with the collective agreement by the largest print media enterprise in the country.
.The Committee notes that the complainants indicate that on  February , the enterprise dismissed  workers from the production area,  of whom were members of Trade Union No.  of the enterprise ( per cent of its  members), and allege that, although the enterprise justified the dismissals on economic grounds and on the basis of its decision to outsource part of the printing of the products to an external printing works that allegedly provided a lower-cost and higher-quality service, the dismissals were intended to instil fear in the workers and prevent any work stoppages during the collective bargaining process that was due to take place in the subsequent months.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the enterprise indicates that: (i) its revenue has fallen by . per cent in recent years and restructuring has led to more than  people losing their job; (ii) the sustained loss of advertising revenue led to the enterprise deciding to outsource part of the printing of its products, which involved an internal restructuring that particularly affected the production area, as there were no other areas to which the workers concerned could be reassigned; and (iii) with a view to concluding the contractual relationship in an appropriate manner, the enterprise offered those who were in agreement with the contract termination a financial incentive over and above what it was legally obligated to offer, advice on social security and a plan for finding a new job.
.The Committee also notes that the complainants and the Government both indicate that more than half of the laid-off workers lodged complaints on the grounds of anti-union practices and sought to have the dismissals declared null and void, and that, according to the Government, decisions have been handed down in a number of proceedings, a conciliation agreement has been reached in some others, and in other proceedings either there has not yet been a decision or an action for annulment has been brought which has not yet been resolved. The Government also informs the Committee that in all of the court cases brought by the union in which a decision has been handed down, for a total of  workers, the layoffs were found to be lawful and the complaints of infringement of freedom of association were dismissed. The courts found that the outsourcing process had begun well before the collective bargaining process, that production was being outsourced with a view to increasing competitiveness and that it did not aim to weaken the union, either directly or indirectly, also taking account of the fact that the enterprise has high levels of unionization among all categories of employees.
.While duly noting the decisions and the fact that there are still legal proceedings ongoing, the Committee observes that, without prejudice to the financial reasons which may have underpinned the outsourcing, and without prejudice to the high level of unionization among the enterprise s workers, the layoffs almost exclusively affected",2,2017,Chile
4,"unionized workers and the restructuring had a direct impact on Trade Union No.  of the enterprise. However, the foregoing does not permit reaching the conclusion that the workers were dismissed because of their union membership or their participation in legitimate union activities. In this particular case, the Committee recalls the importance of consulting with trade unions when elaborating restructuring programmes, since they have a fundamental role to play in ensuring that programmes of this nature have the least possible effect on workers [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.The Committee notes that the complainants also allege that, without prior consultation with Trade Union No. , the enterprise requested the Labour Directorate to designate the minimum services and emergency teams, which resulted in a unilateral suspension of the collective bargaining process. In this regard, the Committee notes that the enterprise indicates that although Act No. , which was published on  September  and has been in force since  April , indicates that enterprises and trade union organizations may designate the minimum services and emergency teams by common accord, transitional article  of the Act indicates that, where collective bargaining is due to commence within two months of the entry into force of the Act, the employer must make an application to the Regional Labour Directorate within a time limit of ninety days beginning from the fourth month following the publication of the Act. The enterprise indicates that collective bargaining with the union was due to begin between April and May , and therefore the request for the designation of minimum services was due to be submitted by  March , on which date the enterprise submitted the request to the Labour Directorate.
.The Committee also notes that the Government adds that: (i) the right to request the designation of minimum services and emergency teams must be exercised with strict adherence to the principle of good faith; (ii) in a decision issued in November , the Labour Directorate determined that the employer s inertia in approaching its counterpart to seek an agreement on designating the minimum services and emergency teams cannot be considered to be a flaw that invalidates the submitted request; (iii) the entry into force of Act No.  might have given rise to situations requiring adjustments through the administrative and/or legislative channels, all of which is currently under review with a view to creating greater certainty on the matter; and (iv) on  May , the Labour Directorate declared the work of security guards to be the only minimum service, which allowed the parties to proceed with their negotiations, resulting in the signature of the current collective agreement on  September , which is valid until  September .
.The Committee observes that the matter concerning the request for the designation of minimum services and emergency teams has its origins in the provisions of transitional article  of Act No. , which applied only to collective bargaining processes that were due to begin within the first six months of the entry into force of the Act, that is, until October . Furthermore, taking into account the information from the Government that the enterprise and the union signed a collective agreement on  September  that is in force until  September , the Committee will not examine the matter further.
.Lastly, concerning the allegation of non-compliance with the collective agreement that is no longer in force, the Committee observes that, as the Government indicates, the complainants did not specify which clauses were allegedly violated by the enterprise and the nature of the alleged non-compliance. Consequently, and taking account of the fact that the union and the enterprise have negotiated a new collective agreement that is in force, the Committee will not examine this allegation further.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",2,2017,Chile
5,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association of Customs Officers of Chile (ANFACH), the National Association of Public Servants (ANEF) and the Amalgamated Workers' Union of Chile (CUT) dated  June . Further information was sent subsequently on  July .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January and  October .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  June and  July , ANFACH, ANEF and CUT indicate that ANFACH entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Government on  November  on strengthening the National Customs Service (SNA). The signatories undertook to draft a bill to modernize the SNA and improve the working conditions of employees, by recruiting more staff, gradually integrating contractual workers into the workforce and holding internal competitions to fill vacant posts, giving priority to employee length of service. They also agreed on a timetable of action and the establishment of negotiating tables to reach agreement on specific aspects of the memorandum of agreement.
.The complainants indicate that, on  May , ANFACH submitted a proposal to the Government specifically on staffing levels and employee classification for submission to Congress and that, on  May, the Government submitted a counter-proposal that differed completely from the guidelines stipulated in the memorandum of understanding, and indicated that this was not open for amendment. The complainants indicate that the Government s proposal ignores the fact that the classification should be carried out in one single process, limits the inclusion of employees who have met the agreed length-of-service requirement (two years from  May ), cancels the internal promotion competitions agreed for  and generally removes length of service as the determining criterion for grade improvements and competitions.
.The complainants indicate that, due to the Government s refusal to adhere to the terms of the above-mentioned memorandum of understanding, ANFACH s national executive committee decided to call an indefinite strike from  May , with emergency teams in place to carry out any urgent work whose interruption could cause irreparable damage to the country. The complainants' state that during the work stoppage the circulation of people, vehicles and cargo was at no time held up, but was much slower and there was strict adherence to the regulations.
.The complainants allege that, notwithstanding the above, during the work stoppage the following acts of violence and irregularities occurred: (i) three union officials and one member of ANFACH who were demonstrating peacefully in the Arturo Merino Bentez airport on  May  were subjected to violent repression, evicted by the special police forces and detained for four hours; (ii) on  May , in the town of Iquique, the special police forces ordered the union members who were carrying out essential duties to leave and held the demonstrators for nearly three hours, who suffered physical and psychological violence at the hands of the police; (iii) On  May, the customs director of the Arica and Parinacota region ordered trusted and new employees and police staff to cover the posts of the strikers; and (iv) on  June , the manager on duty at the Los Andes customs facility at the Los Libertadores Border Complex, who was a member of ANFACH, was notified that he was being relieved of his duties by the customs administrator, for the sole reason that he had taken part in the strike.
.The complainants indicate that, on  June , after ANEF asked the President of the Republic to re-establish dialogue and to halt the use of police forces, the Government publicly stated that it was withdrawing the proposal that had led to the strike action and called for dialogue to resume. As a result, the strike was immediately called off. The complainants indicate that they requested the Government to abide by the original agreement and to ensure that there would be no reprisals of any kind against those who had taken part in the work stoppage. The complainants stated that, while there has been partial compliance with the first request, given that efforts are ongoing with the Government on the content of the proposal that will be submitted to National Congress, the second request on the other hand was not accepted and instead the Government implemented an unacceptably repressive policy.
.The complainants allege that more than  workers had their pay deducted, including almost all ANFACH union officials, and that SNA senior management was instructed to make a negative entry in the employment records of some employees, which is an unjustified reprisal considering that it is a sanction intended to punish poor management and not for taking part in a statutory strike. The complainants also allege that, on  June , a division of SNA headquarters informed its employees that it would not be renewing the contracts of the contractual workers who took part in the strike action. With regard to those threats, the complainants have provided a copy of the email sent on  June  by Ms Lidia Hernndez Villegas, Head of the Primary Control Point subdivision, addressed to all workers in primary control points in the metropolitan region, which states:  Dear colleagues of the Primary Control Point subdivision, as informed verbally by myself yesterday,  June , I am informing you again in writing of the instructions issued by the Service Directorate regarding the new measures to be implemented in work stoppages in the future. Employees may take part in a stoppage, but days not worked will be deducted from their pay and a negative entry will be made in their employment records; contractual workers who take part in a stoppage will not have their contracts renewed.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Lastly, the complainants allege that the Government failed to use social dialogue mechanisms to handle the above-mentioned dispute. In particular, they consider that it did not observe Articles  and  of Convention No. , ratified by Chile, which require the adoption of machinery for negotiation or other methods to allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of terms and conditions of employment, as well as mechanisms to settle disputes pertaining to the determination of such terms and conditions that ensure the confidence of the parties involved.
.In its communications dated  January and  October , the Government indicates that the SNA is a public service responsible for monitoring and controlling the passage of goods via the coasts, borders and airports of Chile, for supervising international traffic for the purpose of collecting taxes on imports and exports and generating international traffic statistics. The Government also indicates that the SNA is subject to the authority of the Office of the Comptroller General and that the latter has issued a number of opinions to the effect that it is the exclusive right of the highest authority of a service to instruct its own staff on where they will be located, deciding at its discretion how its employees will be allocated and placed, depending on the needs of the department they manage.
.The Government indicates that, in a communication dated  May , ANFACH called a national strike, involving a total and indefinite work stoppage, from  May, during which no cargo or persons passing through customs would be handled. Between  May and  June , a work stoppage called by ANFACH took place, in which a total of  employees took part nationwide, which had a serious impact on the continuity of the service s work and on access by nationals and foreigners to the services provided by the organization, affecting in particular the transit of persons and goods in bordering countries. The Government indicates that, in order to provide the most important services for the population, senior management took emergency measures so as to offer as many essential services as possible, using staff not involved in the work stoppage or seconded from other departments.
.With regard to the alleged non-compliance with the memorandum of understanding entered into on  November , which in ANFACH s view violated Article  of Convention No. , the Government states that, once the strike action was over, the Government resumed negotiations with ANFACH. A negotiating table headed by the office of the Treasury Under-Secretary is currently in place with a view to reaching consensus on the outstanding issues of the memorandum of understanding. The executive branch is of the view that, if properly implemented, it will result in a major modernization of the SNA and lead not only to improving the working conditions of its employees but also to a more efficient service to meet the needs of citizens. According to the Government, this demonstrates its willingness to establish procedures for determining terms and conditions of employment as provided in Article  of the Convention.
.The Government reports that ANFACH filed an application for protection with the Valparaso appeals court against the",-1,2017,Chile
6,"pay deductions of  employees because of the work stoppage from  May to  June . The Government indicates that, although the lower court rejected the application, ANFACH filed an appeal and, on  January , the Supreme Court overturned the lower court s ruling and ultimately accepted the application for protection filed by ANFACH. The Government has provided a copy of the Supreme Court s ruling, which emphasizes that the deductions were manifestly unlawful, given that no prior investigation had been carried out to determine the precise identity of those who had taken part in the work stoppage. The Government indicates that, as a result of the ruling, the amounts deducted were repaid to the applicants on  January .
.The Government further reports that two SNA employees, who were ANFACH members, filed an application for protection with the Valparaso appeals court against the negative entries made in their employment records. It indicates that the court s ruling, which was in favour of the SNA s position, was the subject of an appeal before the Supreme Court, which upheld the original ruling. The Government has attached a copy of the ruling dated  September , which indicated that the negative entries were made because both employees, who hold management positions, took part in the work stoppage, despite reporting to their place of work and signing the attendance record. They did not carry out their management duties between  May and  June . These officials failed to perform their duties in a constant and regular manner, thereby disrupting the normal functioning of the administration, which, by default, can be considered as reprehensible conduct or performance by the officials. It further indicates that there are no grounds to support clearly, precisely, seriously and unequivocally that the negative entries can be deemed to be undue discrimination or exerting physical force or psychological pressure with the sole aim of encouraging or discouraging union membership or withdrawal.
.The Government also indicates that ANFACH s national executive committee filed an application for protection of labour rights for anti-union practices with the Valparaso Labour Court, on behalf of its members, alleging persecution of employees who took part in the strike action, negative entries in employment records, arbitrary pay deductions and discrimination against contractual workers who took part in the strike action, by threatening them with mass dismissals. The Government has provided a copy of the ruling handed down on  May , which indicates that the court: (i) accepted the claim by the SNA that the application for protection of labour rights relating to the negative entries in employment records should be declared inadmissible, on the grounds that these had already been the subject to an application for protection; and (ii) rejected the request for protection of labour rights relating to anti-union practices. In particular, with regard to the alleged threats to the employment stability of the contractual workers and to the email sent on  June  by Ms Lidia Hernndez Villegas, Head of the Primary Control Point subdivision, the court found that the email in question could not be deemed a threat to freedom of association or to the right to organize because it did not emanate from the national director and neither has it been proven that it was sent on his orders. It has not been proven that the email was addressed solely to union officials or members of ANFACH, or that the measures would only apply to its members or officials, and thus it is impossible to conclude that it denotes a voluntary, precise and intentional act aimed at discouraging employees from joining or encouraging their withdrawal from ANFACH. The ruling also rejected the claim of other alleged anti-union practices that are not the subject of this complaint.
.With regard to the above-mentioned email, the Government indicates that there was no formal order or express instruction issued by the SNA specifying the non-renewal of the contracts of the contractual workers who took part in the strike action called by ANFACH. The Government states that, in any case, article () of the Constitution stipulates that public servants cannot take part in strikes because they also have a duty to meet the needs of the public on a continuing, permanent basis, as laid down in section  of the Constitutional Act establishing the general principles of state administration (Act No. ). The Government indicates that, in this connection, section (i) of the Administrative Statute prohibits public servants from organizing, promoting, or taking part in strikes and the total or partial interruption or stoppage of work, arbitrarily detaining persons and engaging in any other acts that disrupt the normal functioning of state administration bodies. In the Government s view, in light of the foregoing, it may be concluded that participation in such activities can, in law, constitute a precedent, meaning that, if deemed appropriate, a contract may not be renewed. Such a decision must be carried out in accordance with the relevant statutory norms and be subject to the issuance of an administrative act establishing the grounds supporting it.
.The Government indicates that the ruling issued on  May  by the Valparaso Labour Court was the subject of an appeal for annulment filed by the applicant with the Valparaso appeals court on  June , which was ultimately rejected on  July  and the original ruling executed on  August .
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainants allege government non-compliance with a memorandum of understanding on strengthening the SNA, as well as acts of repression in punishment for collective work stoppages and protests and failure to use social dialogue mechanisms to handle the dispute.
.The Committee notes that the complainants allege that the Government failed to comply with the memorandum of understanding that had been concluded with ANFACH on  November , in which they had agreed that a bill would be drafted aimed at modernizing the SNA and improving the working conditions of employees. More specifically, they allege that, following the signing of the memorandum of understanding, ANFACH submitted a proposal to the Government specifically on staffing levels and employee classification, which was in line with what had been agreed in the memorandum of understanding, and that the Government submitted a counter-proposal that differed completely from what had been agreed in the memorandum of understanding. As a result, ANFACH called a work stoppage from  May , in which around  employees took part nationwide, and which ended on  June  when the Government announced that it was withdrawing the proposal that had led to the strike action, and called for dialogue to resume.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainants and the Government, once the strike action was over, the Government resumed negotiations with ANFACH and a negotiating table headed by the office of the Treasury Under-Secretary is currently in place with a view to reaching consensus on the outstanding issues of the memorandum of understanding. The Committee also notes that, according to information published recently by ANFACH, these negotiations led to a consensus being reached in January  on the content of the bill on strengthening the SNA. The bill was recently unanimously adopted in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate Treasury Committee and will now pass to the Upper House.
.The Committee further notes that the complainants allege that during the peaceful demonstrations acts of violence occurred (police repression and detention by the police) and strikers were moved. In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that: (i) the work stoppage had a serious impact on the SNA s work, affecting in particular the transit of persons and goods in neighbouring countries; and (ii) in order to provide the most important services, emergency measures were taken so as to offer as many essential services as possible, using staff not involved in the work stoppage or seconded from other departments. The Committee observes that, in its reply, the Government does not respond directly to the allegations of police repression, but nevertheless does not contest that it was a peaceful demonstration. In this connection, the Committee recalls that the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The intervention of the forces of order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of the peace [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].
.With regard to the allegation that an ANFACH member, the manager on duty at the Los Andes customs facility at the Los Libertadores Border Complex was relieved of his duties for taking part in the strike, the Committee observes that, while the Government has not sent its observations in this",-1,2017,Chile
7,"regard, neither have the complainants provided any information that would lead the Committee to conclude that the employee was relieved of this duties because of his union membership or for taking part in the work stoppage. The Committee will therefore not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the allegations relating to pay reductions during the strike, negative entries in the employment records of two employees and threats of dismissals against the contractual workers who took part in the strike action were the subject of several legal actions, on which the following rulings have already been handed down: (i) the ruling on the application for protection of labour rights regarding the pay deductions found in favour of ANFACH (because the identity of those who had taken part in the strike had not been determined) and, as a result of the ruling, the amounts deducted were repaid to the applicants on  January ; and (ii) the rulings on the negative entries in the employment records of two employees found in favour of the SNA on the grounds that the employees who took part in the work stoppage held management positions.
.The Committee also notes that, in a claim of anti-union practices filed by ANFACH, the court found that the email sent by the head of a subdivision, which stated that the contractual workers who had taken part in the strike would not have their contracts renewed, did not constitute a threat to freedom of association because the email had not been issued by the national director and was not addressed to ANFACH or its members. The Committee further notes that the Government indicates that: (i) according to the Constitution and the Constitutional Act establishing the general principles of state administration (Act No. ), public servants are prohibited from taking part in strikes and have a duty to meet the needs of the public on a continuing, permanent basis; and (ii) in the light of the foregoing, it may be concluded that the participation of employees in such activities can, in law, constitute a precedent, meaning that, if deemed appropriate, a contract may not be renewed. Such a decision must be carried out in accordance with the relevant statutory norms.
.In this connection, the Committee recalls previous decisions that the prohibition of the right to strike of customs officers, who are public servants exercising authority in the name of the State, is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee observes, however, that in this precise case ANFACH did exercise the right to strike. It further observes that, even though the email in question may have had an intimidating effect, in the present case the complainants have not alleged that the contract of any contractual worker who took part in the strike has not been renewed.
.In the light of the above rulings, as well as of the information published recently by ANFACH indicating that, as a result of the dialogue with the Government, in January  they reached an agreement on the bill on strengthening the SNA, and that the bill was recently unanimously adopted in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate Treasury Committee and will now pass to the Upper House, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",2,2017,Chile
8,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of Workers of Chile (UNT) and the Autonomous Central of Workers of Chile (CAT) dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  January  and  August .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  July , the complainant organizations state that since May , Mr Richard Bobadilla Campos has held an employment contract without limit of time as a mining truck operator at the state mining company CODELCO (hereinafter  the mining company'  in the region of Antofagasta, in the Radomiro Tomic division, in the city of Calama. They allege that, in August , after submitting a complaint to the labour inspectorate for non-compliance by the company with a collective agreement and after having presented himself in September  as a candidate to be a trade union official at the elections of the Workers' Union of the Radomiro Tomic Division, Mr Bobadilla suffered bullying and workplace harassment. The trade union organizations indicate that although the worker was not elected to be a trade union official, following the conclusion of the union s electoral process the workplace harassment caused him to suffer a deep depression threatening his state of health, as confirmed in Decision No.  issued by the Social Security Supervisory Authority in August . The complainant organizations allege that, in accordance with article  of the Occupational Accidents and Diseases Act, No. , in the event of occupational diseases, workers should be transferred to tasks where they are not exposed to the abuse and harassment caused by their superiors.
.The complainant organizations state that on  November , the enterprise dismissed Mr Bobadilla on the grounds of article () of the Labour Code, namely, serious failure to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the employment contract. The complainant organizations attached a copy of the letter of dismissal, which shows that the serious failure allegedly consisted of incitement to unrest and organizing an activity to see a football match of Chile versus Argentina without prior authorization from his direct superior. The complainant organizations indicate, however, that in a report prepared by the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of El Loa Calama dated  May  (hereinafter  inspection report' , on the request of the labour judge of El Loa Calama, in respect of an application for the protection of fundamental rights brought by Mr Bobadilla, it was found that he had in fact requested authorization from his superior to watch the football match; that there were no documents that said anything about the employer withdrawing that authorization and that, in any case, general authorization is granted by the enterprise in a collective instrument for such events.
.The complainant organizations state that Mr Bobadilla began a hunger strike on  April  for reinstatement following his arbitrary and unjust dismissal, and indicate that, with the support of the Catholic church, the Government was requested to hold round-table talks with a view to finding a fair solution, but that no reply was received from the Government in this respect. According to a report on the state of health of Mr Bobadilla prepared by the Human Rights Committee of the Medical College on  June , his health was a matter of concern from a humanitarian point of view, requiring urgent measures to be taken by the authorities.
.The Government sent its own observations and also those of the mining company in its communications of  January  and  August . The company indicates that Mr Bobadilla was contracted on  May  under an employment contract without limit of time as a mine operator at the Radomiro Tomic worksite and that, on  November , his employment relationship was terminated by means of a letter of dismissal, on the grounds set out in article () of the Labour Code, namely, the serious failure to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the employment contract. According to the letter of dismissal: (i) Mr Bobadilla had arranged, for Sunday  October to  October, an activity during his working hours to see a football match, without having the authorization of his direct superior, and had even coordinated this activity with staff from an externally contracted company; (ii) with the intention of investigating the incident, on  October, following the rest to which he was entitled, the worker met with the labour relations department; and (iii) without having authorization from his superior or having a valid reason, the worker left work before the end of his working hours on  October  and did not come to work on the next working day, which was  October , again without authorization.
.The Government states that on  January , Mr Bobadilla submitted an application for the protection of fundamental rights before the Labour Court of Calama as well as an action for unfair dismissal and the recovery of work-related benefits, both of which were rejected in a judgment dated  August . In the judgment, the Court stated that: (i) evidence had not been submitted regarding how the complaint that the former worker had lodged with the labour inspectorate (in respect of which no labour violations were proven and the company did not receive a fine) could have caused animosity against him; (ii) there were no elements to prove that there had been hostility towards the former worker as a result of his trade union candidacy; (iii) Mr Bobadilla had arranged an activity during his working hours to see a football match, without having the authorization of his direct superior, who decides whether or not to authorize this type of activity; on  October, after having met with the labour relations department and finding himself subject to an internal investigation process designed to determine his responsibility in the incident relating to the football match, the worker, without authorization from his superior or having a valid reason, left work before the end of his working hours on  October  and did not come to work on the next working day,  October , again without authorization or justification of any kind; and (iv) with regard to the psychiatric report in which the former worker was allegedly diagnosed with reactive depression due to non-work-related mourning and the fact that in November  the depression had allegedly returned, the Court considered that its value as evidence should be set aside as being well below the minimum standard required.
.The Government states that on the basis of the above the Court rejected the payment of the compensation requested and only found as being owing to the worker a sum corresponding to proportional leave coverage. It also states that, on  August , the former worker lodged an appeal for annulment against the judgment mentioned and that the Court of Appeal of Antofagasta upheld the first-instance judgment in its entirety, noting that according to the inspection report the authorization to watch the match had been revoked one day before the match for reasons of productivity. The Government states that on  December , the Court of Appeal of Antofagasta found the case to be enforceable and the company paid the sum corresponding to the proportional leave coverage at the Court of Calama.
.With regard to the report to which the complainant organizations refer, prepared by the Social Security Supervisory Authority in  (Decision No. ) the company states that according to the report the former worker suffered from depression during a period following the end of the employment relationship with the company, namely from November  until January . It also states that the former worker wrongly interpreted article  of the Occupational Accidents and Diseases Act, No. , given that this legislation stipulates that  members affected by an occupational disease should be transferred, by the enterprise where they are providing their services, to other tasks where they would not be exposed to the causal agent of the disease'  According to the company, the obligation incumbent on the employer relates to workers who continue their present employment relationship and in no circumstance to those whose contractual ties have ended. Neither is there a requirement under the legislation in question to reinstate the worker, as incorrectly maintained in the claim.
.The company also states that it tried to reach an agreement with the former worker in order to conclude the case, without acknowledging any liability, and it offered the former worker a sum of money, which was not accepted because his objective was to be reinstated. The Government states that for the duration of the hunger strike every possible effort was made to bring it to an end and that, on  April , a representative of the Deputy Secretary of the Interior filed an application for protection with the Court of Appeal of Santiago to",0,2017,Chile
9,"protect the life and physical integrity of the former worker, and the Court requested a report from the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in which, among other points, it was emphasized that the former worker was in grave danger and that his life was at risk. On  August , the Court granted the application for protection and ordered that Mr Bobadilla be taken to hospital. The Government states that following his transfer, the hospital issued two statements, the second on  August  in which it noted, among other details, that the patient was still receiving medical and psychosocial support.
.The Government also states that Mr Bobadilla initiated two other legal proceedings in : one application for the protection of fundamental rights before the Court of Appeal of Santiago (claiming reinstatement on the grounds of having suffered an occupational disease caused by dysfunctional reporting relationships); and a claim for damages in respect of an occupational disease, loss of earnings and moral damages before the Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago. On  August  the Court found the application for protection to be inadmissible as the time limits to file the application for protection had expired, and also the alleged events had been previously resolved at the judicial level. Mr Bobadilla lodged an appeal and on  October  the Supreme Court upheld the appealed decision. The Government also states that on  November  the company was notified that a claim for damages in respect of an occupational disease, loss of earnings and moral damages had been submitted for the same events contained in the previously resolved claim on the violation of fundamental rights and in the application for protection. With respect to this proceeding, the Government states that, on  January , the Court rejected the claim and, on  July , the Appeals Court of Antofagasta rejected an appeal for annulment filed against the first instance judgment. The Government also informs that on  July, the said Court of Appeals declared admissible a request for unification of jurisprudence presented by the complainant and that, to date, said process is pending before the Supreme Court.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organizations are denouncing the anti-union nature of the dismissal of a worker from a state mining company, who, a number of years after being dismissed, went on a hunger strike to demand reinstatement.
.The Committee notes the allegation by the complainant organizations that, after having submitted a complaint to the labour inspectorate in August  for non-compliance by the company with a collective agreement and after having presented himself in September  as a candidate to be a trade union official, Mr Bobadilla suffered bullying and workplace harassment. It also notes that in November  he was dismissed for having arranged an activity to watch a football match, despite having requested authorization from his superior to do so, which is substantiated in an inspection report. They also allege that the workplace harassment caused him to suffer a deep depression and state that on  April  he began a hunger strike to demand his reinstatement, which, according to publicly available information, ended on  August , without him achieving his objective.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government and the company both state that the dismissal was due to serious non-compliance with the employment contract, which was corroborated by the Labour Court of Calama, which rejected the application for the protection of fundamental rights and an action for unfair dismissal initiated by Mr Bobadilla in January . The Committee observes that in that judgment the Court concluded that it had not been proven that there had been hostility against the former worker for having submitted a complaint to the labour inspectorate or for having participated in trade union elections. The Committee also observes that the Court of Appeal of Antofagasta rejected an appeal for annulment of the judgment mentioned and noted that according to the inspection report the authorization to watch the football match had been revoked one day before the match.
.The Committee notes the company s statement that it tried to reach an agreement with the former worker, without acknowledging any liability, and that despite offering him a sum of money, it was not accepted because his objective was to be reinstated. It also notes that, according to the Government, in order to protect the life and physical integrity of the former worker during his outdoor hunger strike, an application for protection was filed and on  August  the Court of Appeal of Santiago ordered that he be taken to hospital, where he allegedly stayed until  August of the same year. The Committee further notes that, according to the Government, Mr Bobadilla initiated other legal proceedings in  that were not related to the alleged anti-union nature of the dismissal.
., The Committee notes that the legal proceedings initiated at the national level focused primarily on issues unrelated to the anti-union nature of the dismissal (the existence or otherwise of authorization to arrange an activity relating to a football match, and the worker s depression) and that they only referred marginally to the candidacy of the former worker for the position of trade union official. The Committee observes that the judicial decisions found that the dismissal had been due to serious non-compliance with the employment contract and that there was no evidence of the impact of the worker s candidacy on that decision. In view of the above conclusions and not having the necessary information to determine the existence or otherwise of anti-union discrimination against Mr Bobadilla, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2017,Chile
10,".The complaints are contained in two communications from the Union Assistants' National Federation for Municipal Education Corporation Workers in Chile (FENASICOM) and the National Federation of Education Workers (SUTE CHILE), dated  August  and  September , respectively. SUTE CHILE sent additional information in communications dated  February  and  January .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July  and  December .
.In view of the nature of the issues raised in the complaints, Cases Nos  (FENASICOM) and  (SUTE CHILE) will be examined together by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  August , the Union Assistants' National Federation for Municipal Education Corporation Workers in Chile (FENASICOM) alleges that the draft Act establishing a public education system and amending various legal texts, which was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in November , does not include the right to organize of non-teaching personnel in educational establishments, their right to bargain collectively, nor their resulting right to strike. The complainant organization explains that, in accordance with Act No.  of  July , education assistant personnel who work in educational establishments under the authority of private, non-profit corporations created by councils to manage municipal education have a right to bargain collectively to establish working conditions and terms of employment and remuneration, thanks to an exceptional legal provision. Such right is not extended to teaching assistant personnel working in educational establishments under the authority of education administration departments, who are subject to the provisions of Act No.  on civil servants' associations.
.FENASICOM alleges that the draft act ' which aims to create a single system managed by decentralized public bodies by transferring personnel who work for the private corporations mentioned ' violates the right to freedom of association, since section  prescribes that  starting from the date of education service transfer, a period of two years shall be granted for the trade unions representing the transferred personnel to merge, amend their statutes in accordance with Act No.  and switch to being governed by such provisions for all legal purposes following the submission of the amended statutes to the Labour Inspectorate'  According to the trade union organization, this means that trade unions have two years to dissolve their organizations and become civil servants' associations or else they will cease to function, in violation of Article  of Convention No. .
.In a communication dated  September , the National Federation of Education Workers (SUTE CHILE) indicates that the draft act establishing the public education system (Official Gazette No. -) seeks to give the public education system a new institutional structure. The complainant organization explains that the legislative reform will mean that the public education system has three levels: (i) the Directorate of Public Education, a centralized public service under the authority of the Ministry of Education; (ii) local public education services, which will be decentralized public services with a legal personality and their own assets, and (iii) educational establishments (education professionals and assistants). In that regard, it explains that the existing educational establishments report to the municipalities either directly, through the Municipal Education Administration Department (DAEM ' a public body), or indirectly, through its municipal corporations (private law corporations), employees of which will, with the entry into force of the law, be transferred to local services. On that basis, education professionals and assistants organize either as civil servants' associations or as trade unions, depending on whether their contractual ties are with the municipality through the DAEM or with a municipal corporation. According to the draft act, the legal successor to the DAEM or the municipal corporation will be the respective local service.
.With respect to the transfer of personnel, the complainant organization explains that the transitional provisions of the draft act regulate three different situations: (i) the transfer of municipal personnel; (ii) the transfer of municipal personnel governed by the Teacher s Statute to posts within local services; and (iii) the transfer of educational establishment personnel. The complainant organization stresses that the third type of transfer will be carried out  with no break in service'  as, owing to a legal fiction, the transfer of education professionals and assistants from the municipality or municipal corporation to local services will not affect the seniority of workers or the legal provisions applicable to them. Thus, education professionals will continue to be governed by Act No.  on the statute of education professionals, as well as the Teacher s Statute, and education assistants will continue to be governed by Act No. , which establishes that the legal regime for such workers is the Labour Code.
.The complainant organization indicates that the abovementioned draft act contains no provisions on the freedom of association of education workers with respect to either existing or future trade union relations; it therefore expresses concern about the uncertain future of trade unions following the transfers. In addition, the complainant organization expresses concern about the fact that education professionals and assistants will, following their transfer to local services, report to a public institution, meaning that they will, without exception, only be able to organize in accordance with the provisions of Act No.  on public sector workers, which does not provide for the right to bargain collectively or the right to strike. Accordingly, education sector workers will have only one aspect of freedom of association recognized (the organizational aspect). The complainant organization therefore alleges that the draft act will prohibit such workers from exercising the rights to bargain collectively and to strike.
.The complainant organization explains that, according to the principle of continuity enshrined in section  of the Labour Code, existing trade union organizations will remain operational. However, the application of the principle of the continuity of collective rights will be in conflict with the public nature of the new employing entity ' the local services ' which means that workers affiliated to trade unions will have to transfer to a civil servants' association. This raises questions with respect to: (i) the recognition by the employer of the rights acquired through collective bargaining; (ii) the right to bargain collectively formerly enjoyed under the previous legislation by education assistants reporting to municipal corporations; and (iii) the collective bargaining carried out by education professionals reporting to municipal corporations.
.The complainant organization refers to section  of the draft act (section  of Act No. ), on civil servants' associations, indicating that all workers transferred to a public service will only be able to form associations in accordance with Act No.  (regulations applicable to public sector workers), that existing trade union organizations will have two years to amend their statutes and become civil servants' associations, and that those associations will, in turn, have one year to meet the quorum set out in section  of Act No. .
.According to the complainant organization, the abovementioned draft act constitutes a step backwards because: (i) education sector workers, who have historically exercised the right to bargain collectively, will be deprived of a right recognized and guaranteed by the Constitution and various ratified international treaties; (ii) it does not guarantee the continuity of existing trade union organizations after the change in employer; and (iii) such organizations must not only become civil servants' associations but also meet the quorums regulated by the Civil Servants' Associations Act, in the knowledge that the transfer to a local service will increase the total number of workers and thus the quorum requirement.
.In a communication dated  February  referring to the  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May , Official Gazette No. -), SUTE CHILE notes that, as a result of the move to the new public institutional structure, workers affiliated to trade unions are obliged to dissolve their trade union organizations and lose the right to bargain collectively. It also alleges that the draft act denies assistants (as well as professionals) the status of civil servants, making them workers with duties of a public nature but no public sector guarantees as civil servants.
.In a communication dated  January , SUTE CHILE reiterated its criticisms of Act No. , as promulgated on  November , on the grounds that: (i) it violates the principle of continuity and labour stability (transitional sections ,  and ); (ii) it violates the right to freedom of association (transitional section ), as it gives new grounds for dissolving trade union organizations; it does not recognize the rights to bargain collectively and to strike of civil servants' associations from the education sector, whether they be existing civil servants' associations or trade unions that will become civil servants' associations after the transfer of workers to local education services;",0,2016,Chile
11,"and (iii) there is no recognition of the rights that education workers' trade unions have acquired through collective bargaining. SUTE CHILE reiterates that the Act does not respect current regulations for education assistant personnel, which recognize their rights to bargain collectively and to strike. Lastly, the organization alleges that, since the adoption of Act No. , many complaints have been received from education workers in relation to mass dismissals.
.In its communications dated  July  and  December , which refer to both cases, the Government provides information about: (i) the Chilean school system and the reasons for improving the municipal system of public education; (ii) the situation of education assistants in the municipal sector, which is the subject of the current complaints; and (iii) the protection of the personnel concerned with respect to trade union rights and collective bargaining. It appends to its response a document from May  entitled  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May , Official Gazette No. -).
.The Government explains that the country s school system is a mixed, public rivate system of provision composed of four types of establishment that report to different entities: municipal (public) establishments, subsidized private establishments, unsubsidized private establishments and establishments with delegated administration. The municipal establishments to which the present case refers are administered by two types of management structure: Municipal Education Administration Departments or Municipal Education Directorates (DAEMs or DEMs), on the one hand, and municipal corporations on the other. DAEMs and DEMs are bodies that belong directly to the municipality; their functions are restricted to the administration of municipal educational establishments, which includes human and pedagogical resource management and administrative management. Municipal corporations are non-profit, private law entities with their own legal personality. Each has a board of directors presided over by the mayor of the respective commune. The general aim of municipal corporations is to administer the education, health and social development of the commune, carrying out functions in different areas of municipal life (education, health, children s services, etc.). On the basis of various studies on the topic, the Government considers that the municipal public education sector is not in a position to permanently ensure terms of administration and resource management that would guarantee the quality, improvement and future protection of public education across the entire country. Accordingly, the proposal contained in the draft act ' which was adopted on  November  (Act No. ) ' envisages the creation of a national system of public education structured around local public education services. These entities belong to the State Administration and assume the form of decentralized public services specialized in education management, which provide administrative, technical and pedagogical support to the school establishments under them. Lastly, the Government declares that it has held a permanent dialogue with almost all stakeholders and unions in school education, in particular, in relation to the draft act establishing the public education system. The unions consulted include the National Council of Education Assistants, the main representative of that segment of workers in municipalized education, which is composed of various federations and confederations of education assistants' associations and unions from the whole Chilean municipal sector (including FENASICOM).
.Regarding the situation of education assistants (prior to the reform), the Government indicates that they work in one or more educational establishments and carry out functions other than teaching, which might be professional, technical, administrative, auxiliary or service tasks. Education assistants across the municipal sector are governed by Act No.  and also by the Labour Code. The legislation distinguishes their right to association on the basis of the employing entity. For education assistants contracted by DAEMs or DEMs ' i.e. directly by municipalities ' section  of Act No.  establishes that they are subject to Act No.  on civil servants' associations. In the case of municipal corporations, section  of the same Act No.  grants education assistants the right to bargain collectively in accordance with the Labour Code, permitting an exception for this group of workers to the prohibition set out in section  of the Code. According to the Government, the new public education system provided for by the law does not alter the contractual and labour regime of education assistants who work in educational establishments under the authority of municipal corporations or directly for municipalities. In addition, it does not establish requirements or selection processes for transferring all education assistants from municipalities and corporations to future local public education services. The Government asserts that the main modification proposed by the draft act in relation to that sector of workers is to change the employer responsible for contracting education assistants: such employers will assume a single (public) nature, ending the current dichotomy between municipal corporations and municipalities. The Government emphasizes that a key focus of the draft act is ensuring the employment continuity of all workers associated with the provision of public education, meaning that transferred employees will have no break in their employment and will keep their wages and welfare rights. The Government stresses that the  no break in service' transfer model, established in the draft act, means that workers will lose neither their legal rights nor any rights acquired under agreement with the respective municipality or municipal corporation prior to their transfer, including those acquired by tacit agreement. The Government specifies that, in addition to the Administrative Statute, various statutes or specific provisions are applicable to public sector workers according to the nature of their activity. This is true of education assistants, who have their own regulations and statute.
.Regarding the protection of the union rights of the personnel concerned, the Government states that, firstly, workers have the right to join unions under article () of the national Constitution. However, the legislation on the public sector establishes a relevant exception in article  of the Administrative Statute, which prohibits civil servants from joining or belonging to trade unions in the field of the State Administration. Notwithstanding the above, the Government considers that the State recognizes and respects the freedom of association of State Administration workers, who have their right to form civil servants' associations recognized, the only condition being that they abide by the law and the statutes of the associations, in accordance with Act No.  on civil servants' associations. According to the Government, these associations have, in practice, operated in a similar way to trade unions, meaning that the right to organize of workers has also been respected in the public sector. The Government indicates that freedom of association and the representation of labour interests are exercised differently by public sector workers than by private sector workers, but that that does not mean that the rights do not exist or that there are no mechanisms in place for their enjoyment. Moreover, based on the variant regulations and characteristics of the public employment system, the new Act provides that workers should, pursuant to the reform and the resulting change in labour law, transform their trade unions and form civil servants' associations. The Act grants a period of two years starting from the date of education service transfer for the trade unions representing the transferred personnel to merge, amend their statutes in accordance with Act No.  on civil servants' associations and switch to being governed by such provisions for all legal purposes following the submission of the amended statutes to the Labour Inspectorate. In that regard, the Government underscores that the Act grants existing trade unions the opportunity to adapt to public sector regulations. It thus guarantees that educational assistant workers will not, at any point during the transfer process, be unprotected with respect to their right to organize and right to representation before the authorities and their employer. The Government stresses that trade unions that do not make use of their right to adapt will remain as such and will not lose their legal personality or forego their legal existence in so far as national legislation does not permit the dissolution of unions by a decision of the administrative authority. According to the Government, the reform affects not the trade union rights themselves, but rather the way in which they are guaranteed. Once the assistants become State employees, their right to organize starts being governed by Act No.  establishing regulations on State Administration civil servants' associations. In fact, section (a) of the Act explicitly indicates that one of the main purposes of civil servants' associations will be to promote the advancement of their members' economic, living and working conditions.
.Regarding the right to bargain collectively, the Government makes a distinction between the right to bargain, on the one hand, and collective bargaining regulated by the Labour Code, on the other. Public sector workers bargain centrally in some cases and on a sectorial basis in others. It is reasonable that general working conditions ' which are established by law ' tend to be",-1,2016,Chile
12,"bargained centrally. The Government emphasizes that, unlike in the private sector, the vast majority of working conditions in the public sector are governed by law, which means that wages or general conditions of employment are negotiated, in a manner of speaking, erga omnes. According to the Government, this point is extremely important for avoiding inequality between workers in matters such as wages. This equality principle could be infringed in the case of fragmented bargaining. Therefore, the statutory regime ensures a certain employment stability that must be maintained, and which is not guaranteed by the private law regime. Further still, the Government recalls that, in , Chile ratified Convention No.  and that de facto bargaining is carried out with public sector workers within a well-established framework. Lastly, the Government considers that the process of institutional change at the heart of the Act respects the outcomes of the agreements reached by the personnel concerned and their current employers at the time of the transfer of the education service from municipalities and municipal corporations to the future local public education services.
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to the establishment by law of a new national system of public education, which implies structural changes. The reform entails a move from a mixed and municipalized education system ' where (public) Municipal Education Administration Departments or Municipal Education Directorates (DAEMs or DEMs) and municipal corporations (non-profit, private law entities with their own legal personality) coexist ' to a national system of public education structured around local public education services. These entities belong to the State Administration and function as decentralized public services. The complaint refers, in particular, to education assistants from the municipal sector who will continue to be governed by the Labour Code despite the fact that they will have a public employer.
.The Committee notes that both the initial complaints and the Government s response refer to the draft act on the public education system. It should be noted that it was adopted on  November  (Act No. ) and that SUTE CHILE, in a communication dated  January , reiterated its criticisms and claims alleging that the Act violated the right to freedom of association.
.The Committee notes the complainant organizations' claims that the draft act ' and the subsequent Act ' would constitute a violation of freedom of association by not explicitly regulating the situation of trade unions, which would respect neither the continuity of trade union organizations nor the agreements that they had reached with workers' current employers. According to the complainant organizations, the draft act would be a step backwards for workers, who currently have, thanks to an exceptional legal provision, the right to bargain collectively and to strike, rights not included in the national legislation for public sector workers.
.The Committee observes that the main aim of the Act in question is to provide a single institutional basis for public education across the entire national territory and that, in particular, it aims to harmonize the contractual relations of education assistants and accord them a statutory regime. Such employers will assume a single (public) nature, ending the current dichotomy between municipal corporations and municipalities, without that affecting the assistants' labour regime. The Committee also observes that the Government indicates that a key aim of the Act is to ensure the employment continuity of all workers associated with the provision of public education, meaning that transferred employees will have no break in their employment and keep their wages and welfare rights.
.In relation to rights to organize, the Committee observes that transitional section  of Act No.  allows trade unions the possibility to change/adapt their statutes to the new situation so that they can defend their members who are now employed by a public entity (local services). It notes that when the education personnel concerned [professionals and assistants working for (private law) municipal corporations] become State employees, their right to organize will begin to be governed by Act No. , which establishes regulations on State Administration civil servants' associations. In fact, section (a) of the Act explicitly indicates that one of the main purposes of civil servants' associations will be to promote the advancement of their members' economic, living and working conditions. In view of the above, and regarding the right to organize, the Committee considers that a legislative provision inviting trade unions in the sphere of private sector education to modify their statutes with the aim of affiliating and being able to defend workers from public entities, is not incompatible with the right of workers to establish the organizations of their own choosing, provided that merely declaring the required change is sufficient, without prior authorization. The Committee expects that the rights to collective representation of such workers should be fully assured.
.The Committee observes that, under the previous education system, the right to bargain collectively constituted an exceptional provision. The Committee further observes that, according to the Government, that situation was only justifiable while the condition that had given rise to the differential treatment persisted ' namely, the differing legal nature of the DAEMs/DEMs and the corporations ' and that, once workers were transferred to a public service (the local public education service), differentiating between workers who carried out the same duties would no longer be justified, in recognition of the Constitutional principle of equality before the law.
.While recognizing that it is not competent to form an opinion on the nature of the country s education system or the legal regime applicable to education sector personnel who are transferred as part of the institutional reform (given that the assistants are not civil servants but rather public agents with a particular status), the Committee notes that the adopted Act establishes a new ' public ' structure for education, which is the main subject of the complaints as regards its effect on trade union rights. On the one hand, the complainants regret having lost the possibility to bargain collectively and directly with the employer within the municipalized system. On the other hand, the Government considers that in the public sector, unlike in the private sector, the majority of the working conditions of workers are governed by law, without collective bargaining being excluded, although it recognizes that one of the particularities of the civil service in Chile is that it lacks regulated bargaining.
.In view of the above, while it notes the need to establish a coherent national system of public education under the auspices of one common entity and its consequences in relation to the transfer of the personnel concerned, the Committee observes that, from now on, the trade union rights of education assistants will be determined in accordance with the system in force for civil servants. In that regard, the Committee wishes to recall that it has, on several occasions, drawn attention to the importance of promoting collective bargaining, as set out in Article  of Convention No. , in the education sector [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Observing that Chile has ratified Conventions Nos  and , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR).
.Regarding the allegation that neither the right to bargain collectively nor the subsequent right to strike of civil servant organizations from the education sector are recognized, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on the issue of strikes. Recalling that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the restrictions on the right to strike are in conformity with this decision.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations..(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the restrictions on the right to strike are in conformity with the decision referred to in the above conclusions.",-1,2016,Chile
13,".The complaints are contained in two communications from the Union Assistants' National Federation for Municipal Education Corporation Workers in Chile (FENASICOM) and the National Federation of Education Workers (SUTE CHILE), dated  August  and  September , respectively. SUTE CHILE sent additional information in communications dated  February  and  January .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July  and  December .
.In view of the nature of the issues raised in the complaints, Cases Nos  (FENASICOM) and  (SUTE CHILE) will be examined together by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  August , the Union Assistants' National Federation for Municipal Education Corporation Workers in Chile (FENASICOM) alleges that the draft Act establishing a public education system and amending various legal texts, which was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in November , does not include the right to organize of non-teaching personnel in educational establishments, their right to bargain collectively, nor their resulting right to strike. The complainant organization explains that, in accordance with Act No.  of  July , education assistant personnel who work in educational establishments under the authority of private, non-profit corporations created by councils to manage municipal education have a right to bargain collectively to establish working conditions and terms of employment and remuneration, thanks to an exceptional legal provision. Such right is not extended to teaching assistant personnel working in educational establishments under the authority of education administration departments, who are subject to the provisions of Act No.  on civil servants' associations.
.FENASICOM alleges that the draft act ' which aims to create a single system managed by decentralized public bodies by transferring personnel who work for the private corporations mentioned ' violates the right to freedom of association, since section  prescribes that  starting from the date of education service transfer, a period of two years shall be granted for the trade unions representing the transferred personnel to merge, amend their statutes in accordance with Act No.  and switch to being governed by such provisions for all legal purposes following the submission of the amended statutes to the Labour Inspectorate'  According to the trade union organization, this means that trade unions have two years to dissolve their organizations and become civil servants' associations or else they will cease to function, in violation of Article  of Convention No. .
.In a communication dated  September , the National Federation of Education Workers (SUTE CHILE) indicates that the draft act establishing the public education system (Official Gazette No. -) seeks to give the public education system a new institutional structure. The complainant organization explains that the legislative reform will mean that the public education system has three levels: (i) the Directorate of Public Education, a centralized public service under the authority of the Ministry of Education; (ii) local public education services, which will be decentralized public services with a legal personality and their own assets, and (iii) educational establishments (education professionals and assistants). In that regard, it explains that the existing educational establishments report to the municipalities either directly, through the Municipal Education Administration Department (DAEM ' a public body), or indirectly, through its municipal corporations (private law corporations), employees of which will, with the entry into force of the law, be transferred to local services. On that basis, education professionals and assistants organize either as civil servants' associations or as trade unions, depending on whether their contractual ties are with the municipality through the DAEM or with a municipal corporation. According to the draft act, the legal successor to the DAEM or the municipal corporation will be the respective local service.
.With respect to the transfer of personnel, the complainant organization explains that the transitional provisions of the draft act regulate three different situations: (i) the transfer of municipal personnel; (ii) the transfer of municipal personnel governed by the Teacher s Statute to posts within local services; and (iii) the transfer of educational establishment personnel. The complainant organization stresses that the third type of transfer will be carried out  with no break in service'  as, owing to a legal fiction, the transfer of education professionals and assistants from the municipality or municipal corporation to local services will not affect the seniority of workers or the legal provisions applicable to them. Thus, education professionals will continue to be governed by Act No.  on the statute of education professionals, as well as the Teacher s Statute, and education assistants will continue to be governed by Act No. , which establishes that the legal regime for such workers is the Labour Code.
.The complainant organization indicates that the abovementioned draft act contains no provisions on the freedom of association of education workers with respect to either existing or future trade union relations; it therefore expresses concern about the uncertain future of trade unions following the transfers. In addition, the complainant organization expresses concern about the fact that education professionals and assistants will, following their transfer to local services, report to a public institution, meaning that they will, without exception, only be able to organize in accordance with the provisions of Act No.  on public sector workers, which does not provide for the right to bargain collectively or the right to strike. Accordingly, education sector workers will have only one aspect of freedom of association recognized (the organizational aspect). The complainant organization therefore alleges that the draft act will prohibit such workers from exercising the rights to bargain collectively and to strike.
.The complainant organization explains that, according to the principle of continuity enshrined in section  of the Labour Code, existing trade union organizations will remain operational. However, the application of the principle of the continuity of collective rights will be in conflict with the public nature of the new employing entity ' the local services ' which means that workers affiliated to trade unions will have to transfer to a civil servants' association. This raises questions with respect to: (i) the recognition by the employer of the rights acquired through collective bargaining; (ii) the right to bargain collectively formerly enjoyed under the previous legislation by education assistants reporting to municipal corporations; and (iii) the collective bargaining carried out by education professionals reporting to municipal corporations.
.The complainant organization refers to section  of the draft act (section  of Act No. ), on civil servants' associations, indicating that all workers transferred to a public service will only be able to form associations in accordance with Act No.  (regulations applicable to public sector workers), that existing trade union organizations will have two years to amend their statutes and become civil servants' associations, and that those associations will, in turn, have one year to meet the quorum set out in section  of Act No. .
.According to the complainant organization, the abovementioned draft act constitutes a step backwards because: (i) education sector workers, who have historically exercised the right to bargain collectively, will be deprived of a right recognized and guaranteed by the Constitution and various ratified international treaties; (ii) it does not guarantee the continuity of existing trade union organizations after the change in employer; and (iii) such organizations must not only become civil servants' associations but also meet the quorums regulated by the Civil Servants' Associations Act, in the knowledge that the transfer to a local service will increase the total number of workers and thus the quorum requirement.
.In a communication dated  February  referring to the  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May , Official Gazette No. -), SUTE CHILE notes that, as a result of the move to the new public institutional structure, workers affiliated to trade unions are obliged to dissolve their trade union organizations and lose the right to bargain collectively. It also alleges that the draft act denies assistants (as well as professionals) the status of civil servants, making them workers with duties of a public nature but no public sector guarantees as civil servants.
.In a communication dated  January , SUTE CHILE reiterated its criticisms of Act No. , as promulgated on  November , on the grounds that: (i) it violates the principle of continuity and labour stability (transitional sections ,  and ); (ii) it violates the right to freedom of association (transitional section ), as it gives new grounds for dissolving trade union organizations; it does not recognize the rights to bargain collectively and to strike of civil servants' associations from the education sector, whether they be existing civil servants' associations or trade unions that will become civil servants' associations after the transfer of workers to local education services;",0,2016,Chile
14,"and (iii) there is no recognition of the rights that education workers' trade unions have acquired through collective bargaining. SUTE CHILE reiterates that the Act does not respect current regulations for education assistant personnel, which recognize their rights to bargain collectively and to strike. Lastly, the organization alleges that, since the adoption of Act No. , many complaints have been received from education workers in relation to mass dismissals.
.In its communications dated  July  and  December , which refer to both cases, the Government provides information about: (i) the Chilean school system and the reasons for improving the municipal system of public education; (ii) the situation of education assistants in the municipal sector, which is the subject of the current complaints; and (iii) the protection of the personnel concerned with respect to trade union rights and collective bargaining. It appends to its response a document from May  entitled  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May , Official Gazette No. -).
.The Government explains that the country s school system is a mixed, public rivate system of provision composed of four types of establishment that report to different entities: municipal (public) establishments, subsidized private establishments, unsubsidized private establishments and establishments with delegated administration. The municipal establishments to which the present case refers are administered by two types of management structure: Municipal Education Administration Departments or Municipal Education Directorates (DAEMs or DEMs), on the one hand, and municipal corporations on the other. DAEMs and DEMs are bodies that belong directly to the municipality; their functions are restricted to the administration of municipal educational establishments, which includes human and pedagogical resource management and administrative management. Municipal corporations are non-profit, private law entities with their own legal personality. Each has a board of directors presided over by the mayor of the respective commune. The general aim of municipal corporations is to administer the education, health and social development of the commune, carrying out functions in different areas of municipal life (education, health, children s services, etc.). On the basis of various studies on the topic, the Government considers that the municipal public education sector is not in a position to permanently ensure terms of administration and resource management that would guarantee the quality, improvement and future protection of public education across the entire country. Accordingly, the proposal contained in the draft act ' which was adopted on  November  (Act No. ) ' envisages the creation of a national system of public education structured around local public education services. These entities belong to the State Administration and assume the form of decentralized public services specialized in education management, which provide administrative, technical and pedagogical support to the school establishments under them.

Observing that Chile has ratified Conventions Nos  and , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR).
.Regarding the allegation that neither the right to bargain collectively nor the subsequent right to strike of civil servant organizations from the education sector are recognized, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on the issue of strikes. Recalling that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ], the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the restrictions on the right to strike are in conformity with this decision.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations..(b)	The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the restrictions on the right to strike are in conformity with the decision referred to in the above conclusions.",-1,2016,Chile
16,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association of Public Servants (ANEF) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , ANEF indicates that it signed a memorandum of understanding (copy attached) on  September  with the authorities of the regional government of Atacama through the region s Public Sector Board (hereinafter  MSP Atacama' . The complainant organization states that the key provisions of the memorandum of understanding included: (i) the payment of a regular special cost-of-living allowance to the region s public servants, the final amount of which would be determined following a study by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) in  to establish the real cost of living in the region; (ii) the inclusion of MSP-Atacama representatives in the team tasked with defining the terms of reference of the study and in its monitoring and evaluation; (iii) the payment of a temporary special allowance to the region s public servants in  pending completion of the study, with the possibility of renewal in the event of a delay in the study; and (iv) the establishment of a number of round tables from  to  September  to address matters, including the situation of public workers paid on a fee basis in the region, and to discuss various measures with the aim of improving the living conditions of the region s inhabitants.
.The complainant alleges that the Government has failed to comply with the abovementioned memorandum of understanding. In that regard, the complainant points out that, as a result of the signing of the memorandum of understanding on  February , Act No.  was published with a view to granting a temporary special allowance to the public servants of the Atacama region pending completion of the study on the cost of living in the region. The complainant states that the study was carried out between January and February , outside the agreed time frame, and reports that, contrary to the provisions of the memorandum of understanding, MSP-Atacama representatives were not included in the group responsible for defining the study s terms of reference. Furthermore, the complainant reports that in December , on account of the delay in carrying out the study, the governor of the Atacama region informed MSP-Atacama that the temporary special allowance would continue to be paid under the same conditions as in . The complainant further reports that the various bipartite round tables envisaged in the memorandum of understanding were never established. Lastly, the complainant alleges that, on  April , a bill seeking to ensure that the regular special allowance would only be received by workers earning a maximum wage of , Chilean pesos was submitted to Parliament without first informing the workers. The complainant indicates that the workers opposed the bill, which was rejected on  April  by the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.
.The complainant alleges that, in response to the Government s non-compliance with the memorandum of understanding, on  March  the trade union and professional association members of MSP-Atacama called an indefinite strike that lasted for more than  days. The complainant reports acts of repression against workers who took part in the indefinite strike. In particular, the complainant reports: (i) the repression by the special forces unit of the Chilean police of a protest staged by workers in the centre of the regional capital city on  March ; (ii) the brief detention of  workers, mostly trade union officials, who took part in a demonstration on  March ; (iii) the brief detention of the national vice-president of the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT) during a protest in the region; and (iv) the initiation of criminal proceedings against public servants who had taken part in the indefinite strike for allegedly violating the State Security Act (No. ). Specifically, section  of the Act provides that  collective work stoppages, walkouts or strikes in public services ' that are carried out in a manner inconsistent with the law and disturb the peace or disrupt public utilities or services the compulsory operation of which is established by law ' shall constitute an offence and be liable to a minimum or medium term of ordinary imprisonment or confinement to a specific place in the territory'  The complainant adds that the dispute created a high level of tension, leading several public authorities to call for the Government and the unions to engage in dialogue.
.The complainant alleges  blacklisting' and deducting pay from public servants as punishment for their participation in the indefinite strike. The complainant states specifically that, on  April , the Office of the Under-Secretary for the Interior instructed the public services of the region to make lists of those public servants who had not worked as a result of the indefinite strike. In this connection, the Office of the Under-Secretary for Transport and Telecommunications communicated through Decision No.  of  April  that deductions would be applied to the representative of the public servants' association. The complainant reports that, in the same vein, the Office of the Comptroller-General issued Opinion No.  (copy attached) in which it declared illegal the public servants' indefinite strike under article () of the Constitution and section (i) of the Administrative Statute. Furthermore, the Office of the Comptroller-General established in its opinion that, as a consequence of the public servants' participation in the work stoppage, the deduction made from their wages was lawful under section  of the Administrative Statute.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that the Government did not use social dialogue mechanisms to deal with the abovementioned dispute. In particular, the complainant considers that it did not observe Articles  and  of Convention No. , ratified by Chile, which require the adoption of machinery for negotiation or other methods to allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of terms and conditions of employment, as well as mechanisms to settle disputes pertaining to the determination of such terms and conditions that ensure the confidence of the parties involved.
.In its communication dated  April , the Government reports the signing on  September  of a memorandum of understanding between the Atacama region public authorities and MSP-Atacama, of which the ANEF was a member. The Government recalls the content of the memorandum of understanding in its communication and appends a copy thereto. The Government states that, after this complaint was filed, it signed an agreement (copy enclosed) with the public servant members of MSP-Atacama on  May . The Government notes that the signing of the abovementioned agreement put an end to the demonstrations and strike staged by the public servants of the Atacama region and settled the dispute clearly and comprehensively.
.The Government reports that, in accordance with the provisions of the  memorandum of understanding,  February  saw the publication of Act No.  granting a temporary special allowance to the public servants of the Atacama region, with the possibility of renewal for  in the event of a delay in completing the study required in order to decide on the granting of the regular special allowance. The Government states that the study was completed by the INE in due time and form and published in December  as the Consolidated National Expenditure Basket ( Canasta Nacional nica de Gasto'  study. The Government adds that round tables were held on , , , ,  and  March  to inform the public servants of Atacama of the findings of the study that would serve to validate their right to receive a regular special allowance. The Government notes that the social partners involved were informed in those meetings that there were no technical grounds or divergences in the macroeconomic situation of the Atacama region to justify the continued payment of a special allowance. The Government indicates that, with a view to resolving the dispute that arose as a consequence, the  agreement envisaged: (i) the convening before  May  of a round table composed of members of the Government and representatives of MSP-Atacama, to analyse the priorities and time frames for addressing the various items included in the  memorandum of understanding and other documents; (ii) the carrying out of a new study on the cost of living in the Atacama region by the end of the first half of  to once again consider granting a regular allowance to the public servants of the region; (iii) the convening of a joint round table between the Government and the representatives of the region from  May  to agree the terms of reference of the study; and (iv) the allocation of a one-off allowance in  and",0,2016,Chile
17," to the region s lowest paid public servants.
.The Government states that the abovementioned events gave rise to protests and an indefinite strike by the public servants of Atacama in the first half of , as well as to the submission of this complaint. The Government indicates that it did not engage in acts of repression or  blacklist' those who took part in the protests and the indefinite strike. The Government adds that the police force only intervened in incidents that violated the rights of citizens or compromised their safety, such as takeovers of public buildings, physical assaults on individuals, and blocking of roads and paths to hinder the free movement of the inhabitants of the Atacama region. Furthermore, the Government reports that the competent authorities authorized requests to carry out marches and protests in the region in line with current legislative requirements, especially with regard to the feasibility of the marches and protests and the safety of the workers themselves. Lastly, the Government indicates that it gave a commitment, under item  of the agreement of  May , to establish a regional labour forum with worker representatives with a view to analysing and possibly withdrawing the criminal complaints already being investigated in relation to acts linked to the public servants' demonstrations.
.Regarding the deductions in the wages of public servants for days or hours not worked, the Government states that this measure does not constitute a sanction against the workers; rather, it ensured the implementation of current regulations. In this connection, the Government refers to section  of Ministry of Finance Legislative Decree No.  (), approving the amended and harmonized text of the Administrative Statute (Act No. ). In accordance with this provision, wages will not be paid for hours not actually worked except in specific cases that do not include work stoppages, and time not worked must be deducted from employees' wages. The Government also refers to various opinions of the Office of the Comptroller-General, including Opinion No.  of  November  which provides that  when public employees do not perform their duties owing to their voluntary participation in strikes, walkouts or work stoppages, the value of the periods of time not worked for such reason will be deducted from their wages' 
.Regarding the dispute settlement mechanisms, the Government states that the authorities were always available to meet with workers and open to dialogue. The Government adds that regulation of the collective bargaining of public servants could help facilitate dispute settlement; however, the adoption of such regulations has not been possible owing to the absence of consensus among the organizations. Overall, the Government states that it complies with the standards established in Convention No.  and that the right to strike is exercised by public servants without restriction.
.With respect to the allegations and in line with the abovementioned observations, the Government considers that there has been no violation of Convention No.  by the Government of Chile, notwithstanding the differences in the interpretation of the facts by the parties, since these differences were resolved through dialogue, as shown by the conclusion of the memorandum of understanding of  September  and the agreement of  May .
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant alleges non-compliance by the authorities with the memorandum of understanding, acts of repression in punishment for collective work stoppages and protests, and failure to use social dialogue mechanisms to handle the dispute.
.The Committee notes, in particular, that the complainant alleges the violation of the provisions of the memorandum of understanding that had been concluded on  September  between the authorities of the Atacama region and the public servant members of MSP Atacama. According to the complainant, the study required in order to decide on the granting of a regular special allowance to the public servants of the Atacama region was concluded between January and February , outside the allotted time frame. The complainant also alleges that, contrary to the provisions of the memorandum of understanding, the representatives of MSP-Atacama were not included in the team tasked with defining the terms of reference of the study and in its monitoring and evaluation. The complainant further alleges that bipartite round tables to discuss the issues listed in the memorandum of understanding were not established. Moreover, the Government submitted a bill regarding the conditions for the allocation of the regular special allowance to Parliament on  April  without first informing the workers. The Committee notes that the Government, for its part, declares that the abovementioned study was completed in due time and form in December , and that round tables were convened on , , , ,  and  March  to inform the public servants of the Atacama region that, on the basis of the study s findings, there were no technical grounds or divergences in the macroeconomic situation of the Atacama region to justify the continued payment of a special allowance.
.While observing that the parties differ on the subject of the failure to comply with the  memorandum of understanding, which gave rise to the dispute at the heart of this complaint, the Committee takes note of the Government s indication that it signed an agreement with the public servant members of MSP-Atacama on  May  to put an end to that dispute. The Government provides a copy of the agreement.
.With regard to the complainant s allegations of acts of repression by the police force against workers who took part in protests, the Committee notes the Government s indication, in its communication, that the police force only intervened in situations where the rights of citizens were violated and their safety compromised. Regarding the alleged initiation of criminal proceedings against the workers who took part in the indefinite strike, the Committee notes the Government s statement that, under the  agreement, it committed itself to the establishment of a regional labour forum with worker representatives with a view to analysing and possibly withdrawing the criminal complaints already being investigated in relation to acts linked to the public servants' demonstrations. The Committee observes that, according to the ANEF s indications and as it transpires from the Office of the Comptroller-General s opinion, these criminal proceedings had been based on the alleged abandonment of duties by the public servants. In this connection, the Committee recalls that  No one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ] and firmly expects that the abovementioned process of reviewing the criminal complaints will ensure full respect for this principle.
.In relation to the complainant s allegations of  blacklisting' and deducting pay from workers who took part in the indefinite strike, the Committee notes that the Government, in its response, declares that it never drew up  blacklists' and that the deduction in salaries was made on the basis of current regulations regarding time not worked by public servants. In this connection, the Committee recalls that  Salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.Lastly, regarding the complainant s allegation about the Government s failure to use social dialogue mechanisms to deal with the dispute that gave rise to this complaint, the Committee observes that the Government also emphasizes that, as a result of social dialogue, it signed the abovementioned agreement on  May  with the public servant members of MSP Atacama.
.Therefore, in the light of the information provided by the Government in relation to the content of the agreement of  May , the Committee understands that the dispute that is the subject of this complaint was ultimately resolved through dialogue between the parties.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2016,Chile
18,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Trade Union Federation of List A Supervisors and Professionals of CODELCO (FESUC) dated  March . FESUC sent additional information in a communication dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , the National Trade Union Federation of List A Supervisors and Professionals of CODELCO (FESUC) reports that it has affiliated six unions and some , professionals working for the enterprise CODELCO (hereinafter  the enterprise' . The complainant organization alleges that the enterprise discourages supervisors from union membership; that the enterprise s Corporate Governance Act discriminates against the complainant in the systems for representation on the enterprise s board; that the functioning of the complainant s trade unions has been hindered by the dismissal of hundreds of members; that the right to strike was violated through an eviction decree issued by the provincial governor; and that several union leaders were called in for questioning by the police, even though the strike was peaceful.
.The complainant adds some allegations that were already examined by the Committee in a complaint presented on  June  (Case No. ) and emphasizes that, not only have the recommendations of the Committee in its report of March  not been taken into account in any way by the Government, but that on  December  the Government presented a draft labour reform that runs counter to those recommendations. The complainant refers, in particular, to the following allegations:' the allegation that, by invoking the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, workers with temporary contracts for work or services, as well as those serving as directors or superintendents in some establishments, have been excluded from the collective bargaining process;' the allegation that, applying article  of the Labour Code, which requires non-union workers who are the recipients of benefits under a collective instrument to pay  per cent of the regular monthly union dues, discourages individuals from exercising their right to organize; and' the allegation that the enterprise used articles  et seq. of the Labour Code to outlaw a work stoppage called in protest against the policy that the state enterprise was implementing, with a view to pushing through its transformation plans, because they were being developed outside the collective bargaining process.
.The complainant states that there has always been a strong belief within the enterprise that supervisors have fewer trade union rights than operators, who are List B workers and belong to trade unions affiliated to the Federation of Copper Workers (FTC). The complainant alleges that the enterprise s management subscribed to the doctrine that supervisors must not join a union since they are in positions of trust, a situation that is clearly reflected in the union membership percentage of both categories, given that List B workers have a membership rate of  per cent, and List A supervisors a rate of . per cent. The complainant also alleges that it does not have the same level of influence as the FTC in the appointment of representatives to the enterprise s board. According to the complainant, the enterprise s Corporate Governance Act No.  of , which regulates the composition of the board, discriminates between FESUC and the FTC. While List B workers standing for the board are selected solely by the FTC, in the case of List A supervisors and professionals, FESUC must submit a proposal jointly with the National Association of Supervisors in the Copper Industry (ANSCO) nominating a representative from both organizations to the board.
.The complainant also alleges that the enterprise has hindered the functioning of the trade union through dismissals and threats of dismissals. It alleges, specifically, that throughout  the enterprise s management publicly stated its concern at the high production costs and low price of copper, and indicated that dismissals of the enterprise s List A supervisors were inevitable. On  October , the Vice-President for Human Resources stated that the enterprise had to terminate the services of  supervisors and, subsequent to this mass dismissal (which represents  per cent of all supervisors, most of whom were FESUC members), indicated that there would be further dismissals given the copper price crisis. It was also stated that the enterprise could limit or reduce the use of redundancy packages, which is the system generally used to terminate the services of its workers and which sets out a more generous series of employment benefits and compensation than those provided for in law in the case of dismissals owing to the need to adjust staff numbers to respond to the enterprise s requirements. At the same time, on  December , the Vice-President for Human Resources stated in an interview that List B workers affiliated to the FTC were not going to be dismissed, and even referred to the need to guarantee the employability of those workers.
.The complainant also alleges the anti-union dismissal of  members of the List A Supervisors Trade Union of Andina (affiliated to FESUC) on  October . The dismissals took place one month and  days prior to the full renewal of the trade union s board, thus determining the results of the election and the composition of the board. While at first the dismissals had been justified on the grounds of having to adjust staff numbers to respond to the enterprise s requirements, the grounds for termination were ultimately changed and the workers accepted the so-called  redundancy packages'  These packages provided for the workers who voluntarily left the enterprise and fulfilled certain requirements related to age and period of service to receive compensation for years of service for each year worked for the enterprise, as well as an allowance and additional support linked to social security and health.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that the right to strike was violated through a decree issued by the provincial governor of El Loa, ordering the eviction of striking workers from the premises they were peacefully occupying. It is alleged that, on  October , the special forces unit of the Chilean police appeared at the premises of the Radomiro Tomic division with a decree issued by the provincial governor, which ordered the restitution of state property. The complainant alleges that, when threatened by the police, the strikers left the premises. It also alleges that, on  January , the police filed a police report regarding the strike against the ten trade union leaders, all of whom were members of FESUC, and made them undergo a police identity check, even though they had not committed any crime as they had participated in a peaceful strike. This situation seriously affected the public image of the trade union leaders and caused psychological damage.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government sent its observations, as well as those of the enterprise. The Government indicates that this is an autonomous state enterprise, primarily engaged in the exploration, development, exploitation, processing and marketing of copper mineral resources and by-products, through seven divisions. The enterprise has , workers in total, , of whom are in the category of supervisor. Around  per cent of workers are union members, and . per cent of supervisors are union members, within nine unions affiliated to FESUC and ANSCO. List B operators are grouped into  unions, all affiliated to the FTC.
.The Government emphasizes that it has implemented the Committee s recommendations with respect to Case No.  through Act No. , which modernizes the labour relations system and entered into force on  April . The Government indicates that, under this Act, chapter IV of the Labour Code was reformed in line with the Committee s recommendations concerning Case No.  and the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR). The Government highlights that in its latest observations published in  concerning the application of Conventions Nos  and , the CEACR noted with satisfaction the derogation of articles ,  and  of the former text of chapter IV of the Labour Code, which were the subject of Case No. .
.The enterprise denies carrying out acts of arbitrary discrimination against FESUC, showing favouritism towards the FTC; on the contrary, it has always respected its trade union organizations and has maintained cordial labour relations with both federations. The enterprise indicates that it has signed a number of agreements with both the FTC and FESUC and that it does not distinguish between trade union organizations. It states that it fully respects the exercise of freedom of association in its various forms for all workers, operators and supervisors alike, who are free to join the trade union of their choice. This is demonstrated by the high percentage of unionized workers, which",0,2016,Chile
19,"is around  per cent of all its workers. If the rate of union membership among supervisors is not similar to that of List B workers (operators), this is due solely and exclusively to the personal decision of the workers who carry out those functions. There is no interference by the enterprise in that decision-making process.
.The enterprise states that it has signed agreements with the complainant on a number of occasions, which is why it cannot understand the claim of discriminatory treatment between FESUC and the FTC. The courts also reached this same conclusion in two of the four judicial proceedings initiated by FESUC against the enterprise in which very similar allegations to those in this case were made. In two of the proceedings, the claim was rejected, dismissing the existence of discrimination between trade unions, and the other two proceedings are still ongoing.
.With respect to the allegation that FESUC does not have the same level of influence as the FTC in the appointment of representatives to the enterprise s board, the enterprise indicates that, under its Corporate Governance Act No. , one of the two worker representatives on the board is appointed from a shortlist presented by the FTC (as the only organization representing List B workers) and one member is appointed from a shortlist put forward by ANSCO together with FESUC (both have to agree because both represent the enterprise s supervisors).
.With regard to the alleged threats of dismissal, the enterprise states that, while its senior management publicly expressed the need to adjust its costs and number of supervisors as part of measures to respond to the period of economic difficulty it is facing, those statements were made against the backdrop of a depreciation in the price of copper, which is public knowledge and in no way represents anti-union conduct. In the circumstances, the mining companies have had to reduce their costs to optimize their operations. The enterprise s divisions agreed, in their collective instruments, on the so-called  redundancy packages'  which include a series of benefits well above the level of those that workers would be legally entitled to receive on termination of service, as an incentive for them to leave.
.The enterprise states that there were no threats of job losses because of worker participation in trade unions or in activities organized by them, and that the reasons for adjusting staff numbers are related to market changes and to the difficult economic situation the enterprise is facing, and thus in no way constitute threats of job losses associated with the exercise of freedom of association by List A workers. The termination of  unionized workers at the national level can in no way be qualified as arbitrary and was never intended to affect the freedom of association of FESUC or the trade unions affiliated to it. In that context, in October , each division began reducing its numbers of supervisors, which in some cases involved supervisor redundancies or, in others, dismissals owing to the enterprise s need to adjust staff numbers to respond to requirements. The enterprise highlights that the numbers of workers carrying out supervisor tasks at the national level actually rose by  per cent from  to date, increasing from , to ,. On the other hand, the total number of workers carrying out operator tasks fell by  per cent in the same period, as at the beginning of  the total number of operators was , and by the end of  it was ,. This situation, in addition to the fact that greater numbers of List B workers agreed to the redundancy packages, justified the fact that the reduction in staff numbers affected the supervisor category and not the operator category. Furthermore, the cost-reduction measures (with respect to reducing worker numbers) also affected another category in the enterprise, namely List E, which includes the enterprise s managers, who were affected by management restructuring in some of the divisions. Therefore, these measures were not centred solely on workers in the supervisor category.
.The enterprise states that it did not engage in anti-union practices aimed at hindering the functioning of FESUC by changing its quorum at the time of the dismissal of  supervisors in October . It reports that the Andina division did not know which workers were going to stand as candidates in the election and that ultimately the termination of the employment contracts of  workers affiliated to the List A Supervisors Trade Union of Andina was made through voluntary redundancies. The workers opted for the redundancy package provided for in the collective agreement in force and agreed to change the grounds for termination to voluntary redundancy. The redundancy package was the workers' preferred option because it gave them access to greater benefits than the option of termination of services owing to the need to adjust staff numbers to the enterprise s requirements. Consequently, in accepting the redundancy package, the workers received, thanks to compensation calculated on years of service, sums of money greater than those agreed. The enterprise states that the workers, individually and after consultation with their trade union representatives, agreed to change the grounds for termination to voluntary redundancy. The enterprise also states that there has always been a high proportion of List A workers of the Andina division affiliated to trade union organizations of FESUC, which stands at  per cent. This is why  of these workers were affected.
.With respect to the allegation of police intervention in the strike, the Government and the enterprise state that the eviction decree was issued by the provincial governor of El Loa to stop the trucks blocking access to the Radomiro Tomic division as part of a legal strike held by the List A Supervisors Trade Union of that workplace, in the context of a collective bargaining process at the end of . The enterprise indicates that the strikers prevented non-striking workers from entering the division, including workers from contracting and subcontracting enterprises. While the enterprise recognizes the right to strike, any strikes held must respect the rights of other workers of the enterprise and/or of contracting and subcontracting enterprises who, as they were not involved in the collective bargaining in question, had to provide the services for which they had been hired.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant alleges that a national copper enterprise discourages supervisors from union membership; that the law discriminates against the complainant in the systems for representation on the enterprise s board; that the functioning of the complainant s trade unions has been hindered by the dismissal of hundreds of members; that the right to strike was violated through an eviction decree issued by the provincial governor; and that several trade union leaders were called in for questioning by the police in relation to their participation in a peaceful strike.
.The Committee also observes that, in addition to those allegations, in the present complaint the complainant recalls allegations that were examined by the Committee in Case No.  presented by the same complainant organization in  [see st report of the Committee of March , paras ' ]. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the Government has not implemented the recommendations made by the Committee in that case, which referred to the need to take legislative measures in relation to articles ,  and  of the Labour Code. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s statement that, on  April , that is to say after the presentation of the complaint, Act No.  entered into force, modernizing the labour relations system and reforming chapter IV of the Labour Code, and implementing the recommendations made by the Committee in Case No. , derogating, inter alia, articles ,  and  of the former text of chapter IV of the Labour Code. The Committee observes that, according to the Government, in its latest observations published in  in relation to the application of Conventions Nos  and , the CEACR noted with satisfaction the derogations of the provisions mentioned. The Committee welcomes the legislative changes derogating the provisions in line with its recommendations in Case No. .
.With regard to the allegation that the enterprise discourages supervisors from union membership since they are in positions of trust (the complainant indicates that while List B workers (operators) have a union membership rate of  per cent, List A supervisors have a rate of . per cent), the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that: (i) it respects the exercise of freedom of association of all its workers, operators and supervisors alike, who are free to join a trade union organization of their choice, which is demonstrated by the high percentage of unionized workers in the enterprise of around  per cent of all its workers; (ii) it does not distinguish between trade union organizations, and FESUC (supervisors) and the FTC (operators) have participated in the various collective bargaining opportunities that have arisen over time; (iii) if the rate of union",2,2016,Chile
20,"membership among supervisors is not similar to that of operators, this is due to a personal decision of the workers themselves, and there is no interference by the enterprise in that decision-making process; (iv) there are two organizations in the enterprise that affiliate supervisors (FESUC and ANSCO), which jointly represent a trade union membership rate of .; and (v) the enterprise has signed agreements with the complainant organization on a number of occasions, which is why it cannot understand the claim of discriminatory treatment between FESUC and the FTC.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the complainant has brought various judicial proceedings against the enterprise in which very similar allegations to those in this case were made: two of the four proceedings are still ongoing and in the other two a ruling was issued dismissing the existence of discrimination between the trade union organizations and rejecting the claim of anti-union practices. While the Committee notes that the rate of union membership of supervisors is lower than that of operators, in the present complaint the complainant has not provided information on specific acts that the enterprise reportedly carried out that had a direct impact on membership of or withdrawal from a trade union by its members, and neither does it allege that it was not able to negotiate agreements with the enterprise. Noting that, to date, two of the proceedings are still ongoing, the Committee trusts that, if cases of anti-union discrimination are found, appropriate steps will be taken to remedy them.
.With regard to the allegation that FESUC does not have the same level of influence as the FTC in the appointment of representatives to the enterprise s board, the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that, under its Corporate Governance Act No. , one of the two worker representatives of the board is appointed from a shortlist presented by the FTC (as the only organization representing List B workers) and one member is appointed from a shortlist put forward by ANSCO together with FESUC (the Government indicates that both have to agree because both represent the enterprise s supervisors). In this respect, the Committee observes that the complainant has not provided evidence to suggest anti-union discrimination or animus against FESUC and further observes that, as is public knowledge, on  December , that is to say after the presentation of the complaint, FESUC and ANSCO reached agreement on a shortlist of nominations for their representative to the board (a post that had been vacant for a year and a half).
.The Committee notes that the complainant also alleges that the enterprise has hindered the functioning of the trade union through dismissals and threats of dismissals: (i) the enterprise s senior management made public statements to the effect that the copper price crisis made inevitable the dismissal of the enterprise s List A supervisors at the national level (and thus not List B operators), which led to the dismissal of  supervisors, that is to say  per cent of the total number of supervisors, most of whom were members of FESUC, and all of whom were dismissed on the same day, affecting FESUC s image, resources and bargaining capacity; and (ii) the enterprise dismissed  supervisors affiliated to the List A Supervisors Trade Union of Andina (affiliated to FESUC) one month and  days prior to the full renewal of the trade union board.
.In this respect, the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that: (i) the difficult economic situation the copper mining market is facing is public knowledge and the enterprise is aware of this situation; indeed, the enterprise s senior management had alluded to this in their statements; (ii) in that context, in October , each of the enterprise s divisions began reducing worker numbers, which led to supervisor and operator redundancies in some cases or, in other cases, to dismissals owing to the need to adjust staff numbers to respond to the enterprise s requirements; (iii) the aim of terminating the services of  unionized supervisors at the national level had never been to affect freedom of association; in fact, the number of supervisors at the national level had risen by  per cent from  to date, increasing from , to ,; and, on the other hand, the total number of operators had fallen by  per cent in the same period, as at the beginning of  their total number was , and by the end of  it was ,; (iv) greater numbers of List B workers agreed to the redundancy packages, which justified the fact that the reduction in staff numbers affected the supervisor category and not the operator category; and (v) the cost-reduction measures also affected another category in the enterprise, namely List E, which consisted of the enterprise s managers, who were affected by management restructuring in some of the divisions. The enterprise also states that  supervisors from the Andina division accepted the redundancy package, as it gave them access to greater benefits than the option of termination of services linked to the need to adjust staff numbers to respond to the enterprise s requirements. The enterprise also states that it was not aware that the termination of the workers was carried out one month and  days prior to the full renewal of the trade union board. It emphasizes that, in any case, there has always been a high proportion of List A workers of the Andina division affiliated to FESUC trade union organizations, which stands at  per cent, and this is why  of these workers were affected.
.The Committee notes that, while the complainant alleges that the dismissal of  supervisors, that is to say  per cent of the total number of supervisors, most of whom were members of FESUC and all of whom were dismissed on the same day, affected FESUC s image, resources and bargaining capacity, the complainant has not provided any information that would lead to the conclusion that the dismissals were due to union membership or to carrying out union activities, or in order to hinder the functioning of FESUC. The Committee notes, however, that while both the complainant and the Government refer to the figure of  supervisors, the Committee does not have other data (the total number of dismissals in the enterprise at the national level ' among both supervisors and operators ' as well as the total number of workers who accepted the termination package). Therefore, unless the complainant can provide specific information on the anti-union nature of the dismissals, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further.
.With regard to the allegation that the dismissal of  supervisors affiliated to the List A Supervisors Trade Union of Andina, one month and  days before the election of its new board, had an impact on the composition of the new board, the Committee notes that the complainant has not provided any information that would lead to the conclusion that there had been interference in the trade union or in its elections considering, in particular, that the rate of union membership of List A workers of the Andina division stands at  per cent, and it was therefore highly likely that the terminated workers were members of the trade union. In addition, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant and the Government,  workers ultimately accepted the redundancy package and that this gave them access to greater benefits.
.Lastly, the Committee notes the allegations that the right to strike was violated through a decree issued by the governor, who ordered the eviction of workers from the premises they were peacefully occupying and that, after the strike, several trade union leaders were called in for questioning by the police, which seriously affected their public image. In this respect, the Committee observes that, according to information from the Government and the enterprise, the eviction decree was issued by the governor to stop the trucks blocking access to the Radomiro Tomic division, preventing non-striking workers from entering the building, including workers from contracting and subcontracting enterprises. While it notes that the strike in question was peaceful (as stated in the police report included by the complainant), the Committee recalls that the exercise of the right to strike should respect the freedom to work of non-strikers, as established by the legislation, as well as the right of the management to enter the premises of the enterprise [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",2,2016,Chile
21,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association of Public Servants (ANEF) received on  December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , ANEF, which comprises all associations of Chilean public servants, maintains that the Government has refused to bargain with the National Association of Chilean Civil Registry and Identification Service Officials (ANERCICH) and has threatened and retaliated against its members (through penalties and dismissals) for holding a legal strike during which workers were replaced.
.ANEF states that article ()() of the Constitution prohibits public servants from striking and that the Government has never had any intention of amending this provision. The complainant also reports that while no legislation expressly authorizes bargaining in the public administration, in practice negotiations have been conducted over the past  years with the acquiescence of the then Governments.
.According to ANEF, in view of the Government s refusal to negotiate various improvements in working conditions with ANERCICH, the staff of the Civil Registry and Identification Service (SRCI) called a strike on  September , after which the public authorities made statements in the media in an effort to undermine the strike. Specifically, ANEF alleges that: (i) on  October , the Deputy Secretary of the Interior publicly declared that the Government was prepared to invoke the State Internal Security Act (Act No. ) in respect of the SRCI officials (ANEF stresses that this Act is to be applied only in the event of an act that amounts to terrorism or creates chaos within the country); (ii) the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Labour told the media that the strike was unconstitutional and unlawful (claiming that the Service must not cease to function, which, according to the complainant, never occurred since minimum public services in priority areas were provided; (iii) opposition members of Congress also criticized the strike and filed an application for protection requesting that the strike be declared unlawful; the appeals court rejected the application on the grounds that it lay outside the court s jurisdiction; and (iv) the Court of Audit (the body that reviews legality and monitors the fulfilment of obligations by the authorities and public servants) instructed the Director of the SRCI to impose penalties on those involved in the strike; this resulted in over  cases of disciplinary proceedings, as well as dismissals.
.The complainant also states that the Government replaced the striking employees by importing public servants from the country s other departments and administrations, who had no experience in carrying out important tasks such as the celebration of marriages. ANEF reports that in light of this situation, ANERCICH filed an application for protection on  October  in an effort to prevent the replacement of public servants (Case No. -), but the Santiago appeals court rejected the application on the grounds that it lay outside the court s jurisdiction. The complainant emphasizes that, owing to the legal and social importance of its work, ANERCICH continued to provide minimum services during the strike in order to meet urgent needs.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that while it has undertaken to institutionalize collective bargaining in the public sector and to regulate exercise of the right to strike by public servants, it has been unable to reach agreement with the Public Sector Board or to gain its support for this initiative because the unions have given priority to progress on other items on the joint agenda set out in the Memorandum of Understanding of November . The Government emphasizes that it has invited the unions to attend meetings of the Senate Committee on Labour and Social Welfare in order to give their views on the draft constitutional reform legislation, which would lift the prohibition of strikes, and that the unions have maintained that there was no need to regulate strikes.
.The Government indicates that the SRCI is a decentralized public service that is overseen by the Office of the President of the Republic through the Ministry of Justice. Its primary purpose is to keep records and vital statistics on marital status and identity. The Government states that it has a variety of functions, many of which are extremely important to the public, and that failure to perform them can have serious and permanent consequences. For example, birth registration is a procedure that facilitates and authorizes newborns' access to health services; the death registry is an essential procedure that authorizes burial or cremation of the dead; the granting and renewal of identity cards and passports allows individuals to conduct their personal business with public and private entities since they cannot prove their identity until the documents are issued and their absence causes serious problems; failure to maintain the motor vehicle registry has an impact on anyone who acquires, sells or purchases a vehicle, and particularly on those who work with or sell them; delays in recording convictions for domestic violence and other serious offences may do irreparable harm to the victims; and delays in updating criminal records may also do irreparable harm to individuals.
.The Government states that from  September to  November , a work stoppage by SRCI employees had a serious impact on the continuity of the Service s activities and on access to the services that it provides. In light of that situation, management took emergency measures in order to offer as many essential services as possible using staff not involved in the work stoppage or seconded from other departments.
.The Government explains that since the SRCI is a State agency, article  of the Public Administration Constitutional Organization Act (Act No. ), which establishes that it  serves the general public; its purpose is to promote the greater good by meeting the needs of the public on a continuing, permanent basis and furthering the country s development by carrying out its responsibilities under the Constitution and the law'  is applicable. Moreover, the SRCI is monitored by the Court of Audit, which has stated that the Government must exercise its authority and order the modification or restructuring of the Service or the allocation of its staff in order to ensure that it is properly managed in pursuit of the common good ' in other words, in order to meet its objectives and ensure accountability pursuant to Act No. .
.The Government emphasizes that no disciplinary measures have been taken within the SRCI, the striking workers were not penalized and the withholding of wages does not constitute a penalty; it was carried out in accordance with the legislation currently in force, the principles established by the Court of Audit and the judgments of the courts. The Government mentions article  of Ministry of Finance Legislative Decree No.  (), approving the amended and harmonized text of the Administrative Statute (Act No. ), which reads:  Wages shall not be paid for hours not actually worked except in the case of holidays, paid leave as provided in this Statute, preventive suspension pursuant to Article , unforeseen circumstances or situations of force majeure ' .' The Government also stresses that the Court of Audit, in its administrative case law, has repeatedly established that public servants' right to freedom of expression must be exercised in accordance with statutory law and, in particular, has confirmed the legality and legitimacy of not paying wages for hours not worked owing to work stoppages and staff mobilizations.
.The Government states that ANERCICH filed with the Santiago appeals court an application requesting prohibition of the withholding of wages by the Service management, but the appeal was rejected by the second chamber of the court at its summer session (Case No. .-) on  February ; this decision was upheld by the third chamber of the Supreme Court (Case No. .-) on  May .
.With regard to the alleged invocation of the State Internal Security Act (Act No. ), according to the Government, article  of the Act provides that proceedings concerning the offences established therein shall be opened at the request of or upon receipt of a complaint from the Ministry of the Interior and Public Safety or from the relevant mayor and that none of these public authorities has invoked the Act in respect of the events that gave rise to the present complaint.
.With respect to the application for protection filed by three members of Congress, requesting that the strike be declared unlawful, this does not constitute a breach of the Chilean Government s obligations under Conventions Nos  and , but rather the exercise of judicial protection of the rights of citizens through a procedure aimed specifically at reconciling competing rights, such as the right to strike under circumstances that would affect the provision of essential services. The Government indicates that the Court",0,2015,Chile
22,"did not declare the work stoppage by the SRCI staff unlawful.
.Lastly, the Government states that the negotiations that led to the strike culminated in an agreement between the authorities and ANERCICH whereby SRCI staff and contractual workers would receive a performance and productivity bonus; this commitment was met through the adoption of Act No. , published in the Official Gazette of  July .
.The Committee observes that in the present case, ANEF, which comprises all associations of Chilean public servants, maintains that the Government has refused to bargain with ANERCICH and has threatened and retaliated against its members (through penalties and dismissals) for holding a legal strike from  September to  November , during which workers were replaced.
.The Committee takes note of the complainant s statement that article ()() of the Constitution prohibits public servants from striking and that the Government has never had any intention of amending this provision. The complainant also states that while no legislation expressly authorizes bargaining in the public administration, in practice negotiations have been conducted over the past  years with the acquiescence of the then Governments. On this issue, the Committee also takes note of the Government s statement that while it has undertaken to institutionalize collective bargaining in the public sector and to regulate exercise of the right to strike by public servants, it has been unable to reach agreement with the Public Sector Board or to gain its support for this initiative because the unions have given priority to progress on other items on the joint agenda set out in the Memorandum of Understanding of November . The Committee further notes that, according to the Government, it has invited the unions to attend meetings of the Senate Committee on Labour and Social Welfare in order to give their views on the draft constitutional reform legislation, which would lift the prohibition of strikes, and that the unions have maintained that there was no need to regulate strikes.
.The Committee takes note of the complainant s allegation that: (i) in view of the Government s refusal to negotiate various improvements in working conditions (on the pretext that the law did not require it to negotiate), the staff of the SRCI called a strike on  September ; (ii) three opposition members of Congress filed an application for protection requesting that the strike be declared unlawful but the appeals court rejected the application on the grounds that it lay outside the court s jurisdiction; (iii) owing to the legal and social importance of its work, ANERCICH continued to provide minimum services during the strike in order to meet urgent needs; and (iv) notwithstanding the foregoing, the Government replaced the striking SRCI employees by importing public servants from the country s other departments and administrations, who had no experience in carrying out important tasks such as the celebration of marriages, and that, in light of this situation, ANERCICH filed an application for protection which was rejected by the Santiago appeals court on the grounds that it lay outside the court s jurisdiction.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: (i) the SRCI is a public service and its primary purpose is to keep records and vital statistics on marital status and identity (for example, birth registration is a procedure that authorizes newborns' access to health services and the death registry is an essential procedure that authorizes burial or cremation of the dead); (ii) the strike took place from  September to  November  and as it had a serious impact on access to the services that the SRCI provides, the Service s management took emergency measures in order to offer as many essential services as possible using staff not involved in the work stoppage or seconded from other departments; and (iii) since the SRCI is a State agency, article  of the Public Administration Constitutional Organization Act (Act No. ), which establishes that it  serves the general public; its purpose is to promote the greater good by meeting the needs of the public on a continuing, permanent basis and furthering the country s development by carrying out its responsibilities under the Constitution and the law'  is applicable.
.With regard to the issues that led to the strike, the Committee notes that the strike culminated in an agreement between the authorities and ANERCICH whereby SRCI staff and contractual workers would receive a performance and productivity bonus; this commitment was met through the adoption of Act No. , published in the Official Gazette of  July . The Committee welcomes this agreement between the SRCI management and ANERCICH and the adoption of Act No. , through which the dispute that resulted in the strike and in the present complaint is said to have been resolved.
.With regard to the allegation that the Deputy Secretary of the Interior mentioned the possibility of invoking the State Internal Security Act (Act No. ) in respect of SRCI officials (the complainant stresses that this Act is to be applied only in the event of an act that amounts to terrorism or creates chaos within the country), the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that article  of the Act provides that proceedings arising from the offences established therein shall be opened at the request of, or upon receipt of a complaint from, the Ministry of the Interior and Public Safety or the relevant mayor and that none of these public authorities have invoked the Act in respect of the events that led to the present complaint. While noting the Government s statement that the public authorities have not opened any criminal proceedings on the basis of Act No. , the Committee recalls that nobody should be deprived of his liberty or subjected to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.Lastly, with regard to the allegation that the Court of Audit (the body that reviews legality and monitors the fulfilment of obligations by the authorities and public servants) instructed the Director of the SRCI to impose penalties on those involved in the strike and that this resulted in over  cases of disciplinary proceedings, as well as dismissals, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: (i) no disciplinary measures have been taken within the SRCI and the striking workers were not penalized; (ii) the withholding of wages does not constitute a penalty; it was carried out in accordance with the legislation currently in force, the principles established by the Court of Audit and the judgments of the courts; and (iii) the application for protection that ANERCICH filed with the Santiago appeals court in respect of the withholding of wages by the Service s management was rejected by the second chamber of the court at its summer session, on  February , and this decision was upheld by the third chamber of the Supreme Court on  May . Under the circumstances, and noting that the complainant has provided no information on the number and names of the workers who were allegedly dismissed or otherwise penalized, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2015,Chile
23,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  December  presented by the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC). The CTC submitted additional information in a communication of  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) states that the workers belonging to it are in a subordinate and dependent relationship with contracting enterprises undertaking work for the state enterprise, the National Copper Corporation of Chile (CODELCO), (hereinafter  the enterprise'  the country s largest state enterprise. Approximately  contracting enterprises subcontract around , workers who perform permanent and temporary duties for the main enterprise.
.The CTC recalls that in , since it was vital that the enterprise listen and respond to workers' complaints concerning labour relations, workers voted on and approved legal strike action, resulting in the conclusion, on  August , of a framework agreement covering the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises. This branch collective agreement or supra-enterprise agreement, embodies rights and obligations regarding the workers' remuneration and social protection. The CTC indicates that, although the agreement does not specify a date for its renewal, enhancement and improvement, it was widened, clarified and improved during negotiations in ,  and , that is to say, within the minimum time periods established in national legislation for the renewal of collective agreements. This is why, in accordance with the time periods fixed by the parties in their own agreements, it was appropriate to hold negotiations in .
.The CTC states that on  July  it submitted the corresponding application for the enforcement, improvement and extension of the framework agreement and that, following the refusal of the enterprise, and its contracting enterprises to begin the collective bargaining process, the CTC called for a legal strike on  July  which lasted until  August . According to the CTC, the arguments put forward by the enterprise for not negotiating the framework agreement were the following: (i) the time to negotiate the agreement was in  not ; (ii) conditions were not ripe for enhancing benefits under the agreement, since Chilean miners were highly unproductive; (iii) the enterprise was in a difficult economic situation owing to internal production conditions and the low price of copper; and (iv) the CTC s only aim in negotiating the agreement was to secure the payment of an end-of-dispute bonus.
.In this respect, the CTC holds that: (i) the agreement comes up for negotiation every two years, as in ,  and ; (ii) the accusation regarding low productivity is refuted by the Chilean Copper Commission, which produces objective data showing that Chilean workers are highly productive; (iii) the enterprise is in the red owing to its ineffective resource management (losses running into the millions from advanced sales operations carried out in tax havens by the enterprise; theft of millions of pesos in the El Salvador division, with which senior officials and employees of the enterprise have been charged, and overruns on projects); and (iv) in its bargaining processes the CTC has never concluded any deal on an end-of-conflict bonus. The complainant adds that in  the country was carrying out a labour reform, which the workers had been eagerly awaiting and in which the CTC and other trade unions played a critical role, as a result of which coordinated action was initiated against the trade unions aimed at teaching them a lesson, inasmuch as the enterprise sought to withdraw from the framework agreement.
.The CTC emphasizes that this is not the first time that the Chilean State has engaged in anti-trade union conduct in connection with the framework agreement. During the negotiation of the agreement in , the State also engaged in anti-union practices which were the subject of a complaint (Case No. ). The Government has yet to respond to some of the recommendations related thereto.
.The CTC takes issue with the fact that in  during the negotiation of the framework agreement and the strike, the Chilean State mounted serious attacks on freedom of association which ultimately prevented the legitimate exercise of the right to strike. First, the CTC states that on  July, three days after a legal strike began in the El Salvador division, Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, a worker in a contracting enterprise undertaking work for the enterprise was killed by members of the special paramilitary police force (FFEE), who had been on the scene since the night before and who had gone there with the sole objective of repressing, neutralizing and dispersing the legal demonstration of completely unarmed workers. The CTC demanded that the Public Prosecutor s Office and the Chilean judicial authorities issue an official ruling and launch a thorough and transparent investigation, given that the police operations were wilful and riddled with irregularities, and that the police investigations lacked credibility, legality and impartiality.
.The CTC contends that the police statement attached to the complaint shows that: (i) the FFEE and the enterprise constantly liaised closely through their security agent; (ii) the decision to intervene was ordered by the Public Prosecutor and the high command of the special paramilitary police force; (iii) the regional governor was informed of the night operations and he, along with the enterprise, arranged buses to transfer the FFEE to the El Salvador division; (iv) most of the workers who had been on duty on the same shift as the worker who was killed and who had participated in the reconstruction of the scene of the crime (organized by the prosecutor of Diego de Almagro, whom the CTC accuses of a lack of diligence and impartiality) were dismissed; and (v) the reconstruction of the crime indisputably revealed the police s responsibility for the murder of Mr Quichillao Lpez by a sergeant who shot him dead.
.The CTC says that following the murder of Mr Quichillao Lpez and owing to the notable escalation of the conflict, an agreement to set up bargaining committees was signed on  August between the CTC and the contracting enterprises in the presence of the enterprise qua principal and facilitator. This agreement set forth the CTC s commitment to suspend the demonstrations and the enterprise s commitment to immediately reinstate the dismissed workers without reprisals or persecution. However, since August , the enterprise and the contracting enterprises have refused to hold a dialogue to resolve the conflict, failed to honour their obligations and engaged in a series of anti-union practices: (i) mass dismissals in the El Teniente health foundation (FUSAT) and in the ISALUD ISAPRE del Cobre Ltd enterprise (two health-care enterprises); (ii) dismissal of eight workers from the AVANT Servicios Integrales SA enterprise (hereinafter, the integral services); (iii) mass dismissals in the Geovita enterprise (hereinafter, a service provider for the enterprise s El Salvador division), affecting workers on the same shift as Mr Quichillao Lpez who had participated in the reconstruction of the scene of the crime in the investigation conducted by the Office of the Public Prosecutor; (iv) similar anti-union practices in the Steel Ingeniera SA enterprise; (v) pressure exerted by the Ecomet SA enterprise (hereinafter, a contracting enterprise) to persuade workers to sign annexes to contracts which would oblige them to return any wages paid in advance in the event of their services being terminated prior to the period covered by these wages; and (vi) early termination by the enterprise of the civil law contract with Zublin Internacional Gmbh Chile Spa (hereinafter, a second contracting enterprise) by the enterprise. The CTC states that all these facts were reported to the Directorate of Labour, through its national director, but the outcome of the proceedings is not yet known.
.The CTC also maintains that various state organizations colluded with the enterprise and its contracting enterprises and coordinated the following events: (i) the launch of a defamatory campaign directed against the trade union leadership of the San Lorenzo Clinic (hereinafter, the health-care contracting enterprise), with the complicity of the Provincial Labour Inspectorate; (ii) the issuing of a reprimand against the Gardilcic Andina trade union leadership, a process in which the Provincial Labour Inspectorate cooperated with the enterprise in order to use the signatures that the workers had given for a purpose other than the reprimand (an act which was reported to the Directorate of Labour on  November and to which, to date, there has not been any response) (the supervisory body, the clinic and the enterprise are alleged to have facilitated the vote for the reprimand); (iii) deductions made by a service provider for the enterprise s El Salvador division, from the wages of striking workers with the sole objective of dissuading them from participating in those strikes (despite the fact that this act was reported, the Chaaral Provincial Labour Inspectorate and the Atacama Regional Labour Directorate refused to open an investigation into anti-union practices and declared the",0,2015,Chile
24,"complaint inadmissible); and (iv) the illegal detention of a trade union official from Calama after he had reported illegal activities committed by Corts Flores (hereinafter, a transport company), a contracting enterprise undertaking work for the enterprise. His arrest by the police a few blocks away from the enterprise for the crime of making death threats against the enterprise s manager revealed the coordination between the enterprise and the police.
.The complainant also refers to the following anti-union practices which were recognized as such by the enterprise or the courts: (i) the enterprise, acting in cooperation with the Prosegur, Steel and Compass enterprises denied entry to officials in the Andina division, a practice which was reported and the anti-union nature of which acknowledged by the enterprise; and (ii) various complaints, appeals for protection and actions for the deprivation of rights brought by the enterprise against the CTC and its leaders, actions which were dismissed or declared inadmissible by the courts.
.According to the CTC, the abovementioned anti-union practices illustrate the bad faith and double standards of the enterprise and its contracting enterprises during the negotiation of the framework agreement, added to which a media campaign was carried out to undermine the workers' rights to freedom of association, collective bargaining and strikes, by leading the public to believe that  was not the prescribed year for negotiating the enforcement, improvement and extension of the framework agreement. With regard to the possible accountability of the state enterprise for the abovementioned anti-union practices, the CTC emphasizes that the State of Chile is the true employer, in the form of the enterprise, which, in turn, sets up contracting and subcontracting enterprises to employ workers and make them available to the state enterprise to fulfil their respective functions. It is a conglomerate, or economic unit, which, in accordance with the provisions in section  of the Labour Code, constitutes an enterprise for employment purposes. The enterprise dominates the contracting and subcontracting enterprises and either the State has not carried out the necessary inspections of the enterprise with regard to compliance with Act No.  on subcontracting and personnel supply or, if it has, it has not reported the outcome of the inspection and the penalties to be imposed for labour violations.
.In a communication dated  June , the CTC refers to a number of difficulties which arose in connection with the erection of a public monument in memory of the worker who had been killed during the strike.
.The CTC also reports the following: (i) the dismissal in February  of  workers ( of whom were trade unionists) from the health-care contracting enterprise, against which legal proceedings, which are still under way, were instituted for anti-union and unfair dismissal; (ii) the alleged refusal to engage in collective bargaining of the Mantenciones y Servicios Salfa SA enterprise (hereinafter, the maintenance service contractor) in the El Teniente division, which raised an objection under section  of the existing Labour Code, relating to time limits and a lack of opportunity to enter into the bargaining process. This plea was accepted by the Rancagua Labour Inspectorate; and (iii) the alleged illegal replacement of striking workers by the integral services, which was duly reported to the Directorate of Labour, the supervisory body which, in turn, submitted a complaint of anti-union practices to the Diego de Almagro Labour Court.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government sent its own observations and those of the enterprise. First, and with a view to explaining the situation in which the copper industry finds itself, the Government states that the fall in the price of copper has heavily affected this industry over recent years, generating job losses, the discontinuance of projects and investments, downtime and the early termination of contracts, especially in the mining support service sector, and that this has led to a steady, significant decrease in activity over recent years.
.Secondly, the Government refers to the legal framework governing collective bargaining in Chile and emphasizes that, for the last four decades, the only binding and obligatory collective bargaining recognized in Chilean legislation has been enterprise-level bargaining. The current Labour Code retains the provisions of Act No. . Collective bargaining affecting more than one enterprise requires the agreement of the parties (section ()). For employers, bargaining with the union is voluntary or optional and they have two options: first, if the employer decides not to bargain, the workers of the enterprise who are members of the inter-enterprise union may submit draft collective agreements in accordance with the general rules (section  bis (A)); second, if the employer agrees to bargain collectively, the joint negotiating commission must be involved (section  bis (B)). The Government emphasizes that collective bargaining at the supra-enterprise level is essentially voluntary both under the abovementioned current legislation and under Act No.  which will enter into force on  April .
.The Government states that, in light of the above, the workers represented by the CTC have the right to collective bargaining at the enterprise level, whereas collective bargaining at the supra-enterprise level is voluntary. Thus, on  August , in very encouraging conditions for the copper industry, the framework agreement was signed between the enterprise, the contracting enterprises and the CTC, following a dispute affecting industrial relations in the sector and, in particular, the operations of the state-owned copper enterprise. As a follow-up to this agreement, in ,  and , complementary agreements were concluded between the CTC and the Professional Association of Mining Enterprises and Allied Industries (AGEMA) in which the benefits agreed in the  framework agreement were enhanced. The enterprise played a facilitator and guarantor role in the signing of these complementary agreements. Act No.  on subcontracting and personnel supply specified who could participate in these negotiations. Thus, it was agreed that additional obligations for contracting enterprises should be included in the terms of service provision tender and that inspections in contracting and subcontracting enterprises should be improved by granting greater powers than those required by law. The enterprise participated in the discussions between AGEMA and the CTC only as facilitator and guarantor of the agreements, although, when all is said and done, these processes did not amount to binding branch collective bargaining within the meaning of the provisions of the Labour Code, which means that there is no specific or fixed time frame for their completion. This is not therefore a collective bargaining process at the supra-enterprise level, the obligatory nature of which would extend beyond material conditions and what has been agreed between the parties. Hence these agreements cannot carry the same effects as a statutory collective agreement or contract, notwithstanding commitments to revise and improve the agreement, which in any case require the good will of the parties.
.The Government states that the dispute among AGEMA, the CTC and the enterprise began in July  when the CTC sent the state-owned copper enterprise, a request to enter into direct bargaining, thereby diverging from the parties' previous practice and the text of the agreements signed in , ,  and , in which the bargaining process was carried out between the CTC and the contracting and subcontracting enterprises. In this context, the enterprise, in a letter dated  July , informed the CTC that its request should be dealt with and settled directly by the contract workers, their representative trade unions and their respective employer enterprises. The CTC subsequently began to put pressure on the state enterprise by calling a work stoppage which culminated in the blocking of the public road linking the Diego de Almagro area with the El Salvador division camp and in the occupation of those facilities, thus preventing access and jeopardizing industrial safety.
.The Government states that it was against this backdrop that the Chilean paramilitary police force carried out the operation which began on the night of  July and resulted in the death of the worker, Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, in the early hours of the next day. It also states that in order to shed light on the events surrounding his death two investigations are under way which, to date, have not been closed or finalized: one is an internal military police investigation and the other, in which the CTC is a complainant, is being led by the Office of the Public Prosecutor. With a view to further clarifying the facts, it should be noted that the National Human Rights Institute also filed a criminal complaint against those responsible for the death of the worker, Mr Quichillao Lpez.
.With regard to the complaints concerning the anti-union practices of the Directorate of Labour, the Government emphasizes that this body is deeply committed to freedom of association and that its actions in defence of its principles comply with legal and constitutional standards: (i) in respect of the dismissals which reportedly affected workers from various contracting enterprises, it has not been possible to gather all the available information on the complaints received and the status of judicial and administrative proceedings (with regard to the allegations of",2,2015,Chile
25,"mass dismissals in the health-care contracting enterprise, the enterprise states that the decisions taken by the enterprise are not within its corporate control and that, in any case, the dismissals were carried out as part of a restructuring process. The state copper enterprise adds that, at the time of the dismissals,  per cent of the workers were trade union members and were registered with the primary trade union affiliated to the CTC (to date these figures still stand)); (ii) regarding the move to reprimand the Gardilcic Andina trade union,  per cent of the associates requested the Labour Inspectorate to provide a certifying officer to take part in the process of reprimanding the union leadership. After a public notice of a meeting had been posted, a decision to reprimand the union leadership was adopted by a vote on  November  (in which  men and  women participated). The Government explains that the Labour Inspectorate does not interfere in the validation of the grounds of a reprimand and that, in the event of false accusations, it is the responsibility of the organization itself to annul the reprimand or adopt measures to resolve any conflict arising within the organization. All requests to annul a leadership reprimand are dealt with by the labour courts; (iii) the illegal replacement of striking workers participating in the collective bargaining process of the integral services was recorded by the Chaara Labour Inspectorate and reported to the Directorate of Labour, which, in turn, submitted a complaint of anti-union practices to the Labour Court, which resulted in an agreement approved by the court on  March  and the closure of the case on  May ; and (iv) as for the allegation that the maintenance service contractor in the El Teniente division refused to engage in collective bargaining, it did so under section  of the existing Labour Code, that is to say it raised an objection relating to time limits and a lack of opportunity to enter into bargaining, which was accepted by the Rancagua Labour Inspectorate.
.With regard to the possible effects of the CTC s criticism of the labour reform, the Government understands that the organization has a legitimate right to disagree with the Government s views when the latter introduces legislation on collective bargaining and to promote a complete revision of Chapter IV of the Labour Code.
.The enterprise denies the allegations that it used direct or indirect psychological pressure or physical force on workers during the bargaining process, and submits that the general accusations levelled against it are not based on specific facts, but on assertions of interference by the State in this regard. The enterprise also denies having committed acts of union interference, reiterating that these, too, are unsubstantiated accusations. With regard to the mass dismissals of the contracting enterprises' workers who were involved in the strike, the enterprise, as the principal in the subcontracting system, states that it does not intervene in the dismissals of the contracting enterprises' employees. Its sole interaction with the contracting enterprises is limited to establishing, in advance, the tendering terms which are ultimately transferred to the resulting civil-law contract, which are also signed by the contracting enterprises, as any further involvement in the management and administration of each enterprise s human resources would be inappropriate. The enterprise states that the complaint does not contain any factual evidence of collaboration to undermine trade union activity and that, to the contrary, it has acted as a mediator or facilitator of agreements and intervened only when it was possible to promote agreement between the parties which might be linked to matters within its remit as principal, without interfering in trade union or worker organization matters in the processes mentioned above.
.With respect to the public monument in memory of Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, the Government indicates that the situation which arose during the process to authorize its construction stemmed from the actions or decisions of either the Council for National Monuments or the Ministry of National Assets, in which the enterprise played no part. Although the authorization and putting in place of the memorial undermined the legitimate exercise of a right in rem associated with the mining easement owned exclusively by the enterprise, the monument has been built and set up in that location without waiting for the orders which revoked the authorization.
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC), which comprises workers in a subordinate and dependent relationship with contracting enterprises of the enterprise, denounces the excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, and it also alleges that during negotiations to improve and expand the framework agreement concluded in  between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises, various anti-union practices occurred in several of these enterprises.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant: (i) on  August , a framework agreement was concluded between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises (according to the complainant, the enterprise, dominates the contracting enterprises); (ii) this framework is the only supra-enterprise collective instrument that embodies rights and obligations relating to the workers' remuneration and social protection;; (iii) although the framework agreement does not specify a renewal date, it was extended through negotiations in ,  and , that is to say within the minimum periods established in the national legislation for the renewal of collective instruments, meaning that negotiations should have been conducted in ; and (iv) on  July , the CTC submitted an application for the enforcement, improvement and extension of the agreement and, faced with the reluctance of the enterprise and its contracting enterprises to start the negotiation process (they argued that the negotiations should be held in , not , and that the enterprise was facing a difficult economic situation due to internal production conditions and the low price of copper), the CTC launched a lawful strike on  July .
.In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s contention that: (i) the drop in the price of copper has significantly affected the copper industry in recent years, leading to job losses and the discontinuance of projects and investments; (ii) Chilean legislation recognizes only one binding and compulsory level of negotiation: the enterprise level (supra-enterprise negotiation is essentially voluntary); (iii) while the framework agreement between the enterprise, the contracting enterprises and the CTC was concluded on  August , the complementary agreements negotiated in ,  and  were concluded between the CTC and the contracting enterprises which form the Professional Association of Mining Enterprises and Related Industries (AGEMA). The enterprise participated in these negotiations only as a facilitator and guarantor; and (iv) on  July , the CTC broached the possibility of direct negotiation with the enterprise, thus breaking with the parties' previous practice. On being faced with this situation, the enterprise responded that this request should be settled directly between the contract workers, their representative trade union organizations and the respective enterprises employing them, at which point the CTC began to put pressure on the state enterprise, calling a stoppage that would result in the occupation of facilities and the blocking of a public road.
.In relation to the alleged excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, the Committee notes that, according to the CTC, the Government and the police report annexed to the complaint, on  July, the Chilean paramilitary police force carried out an operation in the El Salvador division, which resulted in the death of the worker Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, who died of a gunshot wound in the early hours of the next day. The Committee notes that according to the CTC and the Government, two investigations are being conducted in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding his death: one by the paramilitary police force (which, according to the complainant, lacks credibility, legitimacy and impartiality) and another by the Public Prosecutor s Office, in which the CTC is the complainant. The Committee notes that to date, both investigations are ongoing. It also notes the Government s statement that, with a view to further clarifying the facts, the National Human Rights Institute has filed a criminal complaint against those responsible for the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez. The Committee recalls that in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ). The Committee deeply regrets the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez and urges the Government to keep",2,2015,Chile
26,"it duly informed of the findings of the investigations which are under way and to ensure that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice.
.The Committee notes the complainant organization s submission that, although a protocol for the establishment of a bargaining committee was signed by the CTC and the contracting enterprises, in the presence of the enterprise, on  August , the enterprise and the contracting enterprises have since refused to hold a dialogue to resolve the dispute and have engaged in a series of anti-union practices coordinated by and in complicity with various state bodies. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s emphasis that the Directorate of Labour is deeply committed to freedom of association and that its acts in defence of its principles comply with legal and constitutional provisions. As to the allegation that the integral services enterprise replaced striking workers, the Committee notes the Government s information that this was reported to the Directorate of Labour, which in turn filed a complaint for anti-union practices with the Court of Labour. This resulted in an agreement dated  March , which was approved by the court in a judgment closing the case dated  May . Moreover, with regard to the allegation that the maintenance services enterprise in the El Teniente division refused to engage in collective bargaining, the Committee notes the Government s statement that it did so in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, that is to say it raised an objection relating to time limits and a lack of opportunity to enter into bargaining, which was accepted by the Labour Inspectorate of Rancagua.
.With regard to the other alleged anti-union practices contained in this complaint, the Committee notes that, according to the CTC, complaints have been filed with the Directorate of Labour, or judicial proceedings have been initiated, but to date their outcome remains unknown. In this regard, and in relation to the alleged anti-union dismissals in particular, the Committee notes the Government s statement that it has been unable to collect all the available information on the complaints received and the status of the judicial proceedings.
.The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these procedures, in particular with regard to: (i) the lawsuit filed in relation to the dismissal in February  of  workers from a health-care contracting enterprise in the El Salvador division ( of whom were union members); (ii) the status of the complaint filed with the Directorate of Labour in relation to the reprimand of the officers of the Gardilcic Andina Union; (iii) the decision in which the Chaaral Provincial Labour Inspectorate and the Atacama Regional Directorate of Labour declared inadmissible the complaint arising from the deductions applied by a service provider in the enterprise s El Salvador division to workers who participated in the strike; and (iv) the status of the complaint filed on  October  with the Directorate of Labour in relation to anti-union practices in various contracting enterprises. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on the arrest of a Calama trade union leader who was arrested for making death threats against an enterprise manager, according to the CTC after he had reported the illegal activities of a transport company, a contractor undertaking work for the enterprise.
.On the other hand, in relation to the allegations of dismissals in the following enterprises: (i) two health-care enterprises; (ii) the integral services enterprise (the Committee notes that, according to the enterprise, the dismissals were the result of the latter s restructuring); and (iii) the enterprise providing services in the El Salvador division which allegedly dismissed workers who were on the same shift as the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez, and who reportedly participated in the reconstruction of the crime during the inquiry conducted by the Public Prosecutor s Office, the Committee observes that, although the complainant provides the name of the enterprises in which anti-union dismissals allegedly took place, the Committee does not have specific information on the number or identity of the workers who were dismissed in each enterprise, on whether they were trade union members or on whether they participated in trade union activities. The Committee invites the complainant to provide the Government with further information on the dismissals and their possible anti-union motivation and it requests the Government to keep it informed of the status of any complaints filed in this connection with the Directorate of Labour and on any other administrative or judicial proceedings that have been initiated in this regard.
.The Committee notes that the allegations considered in this case relate to events following the deadlock reached in negotiations between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises concerning the revision of the framework agreement of . The Committee also notes that, although a negotiating committee was set up on  August , collective bargaining between the parties was fruitless. The Committee invites the Government to promote voluntary dialogue and collective bargaining between the parties concerned with a view to achieving harmonious working relations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee deeply regrets the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez and urges the Government to keep it duly informed of the findings of the investigations which are under way and to ensure that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of: (i) the lawsuit filed in relation to the dismissal in February  of  workers of the health care contracting enterprise in the El Salvador division ( of whom were union members); (ii) the status of the complaint filed with the Directorate of Labour in relation to the reprimand of the leaders of the Gardilcic Andina Union; (iii) the decision in which the Chaaral Provincial Labour Inspectorate and the Atacama Regional Directorate of Labour declared inadmissible the complaint related to the deductions applied by an enterprise providing services in the El Salvador division to the workers who had participated in the strike; and (iv) the status of the complaint filed on  October  with the Directorate of Labour in relation to anti union practices in various contracting enterprises. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on the arrest of a Calama trade union leader who was arrested for making death threats against the enterprise manager, according to the CTC, after he had reported the illegal activities of the transport company, a contractor undertaking work for the state enterprise.(c)	In relation to the alleged dismissals in the remaining enterprises, the Committee invites the complainant to provide the Government with further information on the dismissals and their possible anti-union motivation and requests the Government to keep it informed of the status of the complaints filed with the Directorate of Labour and of any other administrative or judicial proceedings that have been initiated in this regard.(d)	The Committee invites the Government to promote voluntary dialogue and collective bargaining between the parties concerned with a view to achieving harmonious working relations.(e)	The Committee draws the special attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgent nature of this case.",2,2015,Chile
27,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  from the Association of Central Metropolitan Health Service Directorate Officials (DAP), supplemented by a further communication dated  January .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  October , the complainant alleges that, on  March , the Director of the Central Metropolitan Health Service (hereinafter  the Health Service' , a decentralized state body with devolved competencies, issued a decision ordering the early termination of the fixed-term employment ( contractual work'  of the DAP s Chairperson, Dr Roberto Eduardo Seplveda Hermosilla, in violation of his trade union rights. The complainant states that the aforementioned decision was rejected by the Office of the Comptroller-General in a letter dated  August  on the grounds that the union leader enjoyed trade union immunity under section  of Act No.  on associations of public administration officials. It also alleges that the union leader lodged an appeal for protection of his rights with the Santiago Court of Appeal, which, on  July , unanimously granted the appeal, stating that: ' .. the Central Metropolitan Central Health Service [had] not denied that it had sought to terminate the contract. This can only be viewed as an illegal and arbitrary threat against [the union leader] since his dismissal would constitute a violation of the trade union immunity that he enjoyed in his capacity as president of the trade union that he heads'  The complainant emphasizes that this ruling ordered the respondent to cease its threats concerning the appellant s employment.
.The complainant alleges that, on  March , the Health Service s Director issued another decision, transferring the union leader without seeking his consent in violation of Act No.  and in a clear attempt to undermine and denigrate him. It also states that, as at the date of this complaint, the union leader had been unable to fulfil his professional duties because he had not been assigned to a unit or office. The complainant further states that the Health Service ordered the payment of several allowances to the union leader ' amounting to almost  per cent of his monthly income ' to be discontinued as from April  in violation of the law under which he had been hired. The complainant considers that this action was only taken because he was the leader of an association of officials that did not serve the interests of the Health Service authorities or the government coalition and that it constitutes clear evidence of an anti-union practice.
.The complainant further alleges that, despite the ruling by the Santiago Court of Appeal, the Health Service s Director has continued systematically to harass and intimidate a number of members of the Service s professional staff simply because they are members of the DAP. For example, he ordered the arbitrary dismissal of  other officials, all of whom were members of the Association. According to the complainant, there are no technical grounds for these dismissals. Both the Santiago Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court have upheld this interpretation in numerous rulings, ordering the officials in question to be reinstated immediately with their remuneration paid in full with effect from the date of their dismissal. In its communication dated  January , the complainant states that more than  appeals against repeated anti-union practices, including arbitrary, illegal and discriminatory dismissals of its members by the Health Service, have been brought before the courts and that the Supreme Court has issued judgments granting  of the  appeals lodged.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that a similar situation has arisen in the Regional Ministerial Public Health Secretariat for the metropolitan region and in the Carmen de Maip metropolitan hospital, where  and  members of the professional staff, respectively, all of them members of the relevant associations of officials, have been  selectively' dismissed.
.In its communication of  July , the Government transmitted the Health Service s observations to the effect that:(i)	The decision of  March , terminating Dr Seplveda s fixed-term contract, is moot since he was reinstated in a new establishment (the San Jos de Chuchunco family health centre) through Decision No.  of  March .(ii)	The Health Service denies having harassed the union leader and notes that, in examining his appeal, the Santiago Appeals Court granted it without confirming the specific acts of workplace harassment that he had alleged.(iii)	The trade union immunity enjoyed by the union leader was not affected by Decision No. /, which was ruled compliant with both administrative and judicial law because Dr Seplveda was contracted to work in the Health Service s health-care network, which includes various health-care centres.(iv)	The reduction in the union leader s remuneration is legal because there are two types of allowances: permanent and temporary. The latter include  responsibility' and  incentive' allowances, to which only a director of service is entitled under current regulations. Thus, given that the claimant had ceased to perform managerial functions, the Director decided to withdraw the transitional allowances while maintaining those of a permanent nature.(v)	The dismissals of the other officials were carried out in accordance with existing legislation since, in the cases involving early termination of contracts, the initial contract authorized such termination where required by the needs of the service. These dismissals thus respect the principle of legality. In that connection, the Health Service has provided a corrected list of the dismissals challenged in the courts, showing the number of appeals granted to be  out of a total of . Thus, the Government maintains that the Health Service fully complied with the courts' rulings.(vi)	Concerning the situation described by the claimant, who maintains that he had no unit or office in which to carry out his professional duties, Dr Seplveda never reported for work at the San Jos de Chuchunco family health centre. However, this issue has apparently been settled since the claimant was employed by the Calera de Tango Directorate from  January to  December . For this reason, he reportedly withdrew the appeal that he had lodged with the Second Labour Court of Santiago.
.The Government goes on to provide its own observations, claiming that the information supplied by the Health Service shows that there has been no violation of freedom of association, without prejudice to the errors and differences in the parties' interpretation of the facts that have been settled through existing Chilean institutional procedures. The Government explains that the law (section  of Act No.  on associations of public administration officials) recognizes the rights of officials appointed as union leaders and the resulting immunity. It points out, however, that, under Act No.  (the Organization Act establishing the General Principles for State Administration), heads of service are responsible for directing, organizing and administering their services, without prejudice to the organization s right to assign its staff as it sees fit in order to ensure the proper functioning of the entity in its charge. Thus, the change in functions arising from the above measures does not affect trade union immunity. Lastly, the Government points out that Dr Seplveda s case involves a single transfer ' not frequent transfers ' which would be in line with the Committee on Freedom of Association s position as expressed in its Digest of decisions and principles.
.The Committee observes that in the present case, the complainant alleges the attempted termination and subsequent arbitrary transfer of the Chairperson of the Association of Central Metropolitan Health Service Directorate Officials (DAP), Dr Roberto Eduardo Seplveda Hermosilla, and the dismissal of several of the Association s members.
.With regard to the status of the union leader, the Committee notes that Dr Seplveda was employed by the Health Service under a fixed-term contract ending on  December  and that the Health Service s management decided to dismiss him prior to its expiration through a decision dated  March . The Committee notes that this decision is now moot and that management decided to transfer him without seeking his consent through another decision of  March , which, in his view, amounts to a form of discrimination owing to his role as a union leader.
.The Committee observes that the union leader challenged the decision to terminate his contract prior to its expiration before two bodies, namely the Santiago Court of Appeal and the Office of the Comptroller-General, which issued rulings on  July and  August , respectively. The Committee notes that the two rulings are based on the trade union immunity enjoyed by the union leader pursuant to Act No.  on associations of public administration officials. The Committee notes in this regard that it is clear from the judgment issued by the Court of Appeal that the dismissal did not take place",0,2014,Chile
28,"and that the issue is rather a threat of contract termination:  the attempt to terminate the fixed-term contract of the protected person ' can only be viewed as an illegal and arbitrary threat against him since his dismissal would constitute a violation of the trade union immunity that he enjoyed in his capacity as Chairperson of the trade union that he heads' 
.In response to the allegation that the decision to transfer the trade union leader was of anti union nature, the Committee notes the Government s indications and the judgments attached to the Government s communication, issued by the Santiago Court of Appeal (on  May ) and the Office of the Comptroller-General (on  November ), respectively, according to which the trade union immunity enjoyed by the union leader was not affected by Decision No. / regarding the transfer because Dr Seplveda was contracted to work in the Health Service s health-care network, which includes various health-care centres.
.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee notes that the decision to transfer the union leader was taken a few days after the decision to dismiss him and although it was a single transfer, the Committee cannot rule out, in the light of the information in its possession, the possibility that the transfer decision was not related to Dr Seplveda s trade union functions. The Committee notes, in particular, that his transfer resulted in less favourable conditions of service and a significant loss of income. The Committee recalls, in this respect, that  [o]ne of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ].
.On the other hand, the Committee notes the Government s assertion that the claimant, Dr Seplveda, never reported for work at the San Jos de Chuchunco family health centre and that he withdrew the appeal that he had lodged with the Santiago Labour Court. The Committee further notes that he was offered another contract after  December , in the Calera de Tango Health Directorate. Noting that Dr Seplveda s contractual status has been resolved subsequent to the termination of his initial contract, the Committee trusts that the Government will ensure that, in the future, health workers enjoy adequate protection against anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of several members of the Association in order to weaken its membership, the Committee notes that the allegations also concern the early termination of fixed-term contracts (more than  according to the complainant, a figure that the Government revises downward in its reply). Although not all of the relevant rulings have been provided, the Committee notes the significant number of court judgments relating to a series of Health Service decisions terminating contracts prior to their expiration over the same period of time on the grounds that the services of the persons concerned were not needed. The Committee observes that the relevant court judgments do not touch upon trade union considerations, but rather upon the attention given to the criterion of the needs of the service, indicating in general terms that early termination of the employment relationship is only possible where the initial contract makes explicit mention of those needs. The Committee notes that, under this criterion, the courts ordered the reinstatement of the workers concerned. On the other hand, the Committee observes that it lacks the information needed to determine whether the Health Service sought early termination of the contracts of other workers who were not DAP members, and thus whether the dismissals were anti-union in nature. Under the circumstances, and recalling the importance of fully respecting the principles of freedom of association, and in particular of ensuring that workers in the sector enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination when implementing human resources policy in the country s health services, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2014,Chile
29,".The complaint is contained in the communications received on  December  and  March  from the National Federation of the Public Prosecutor s Office of Chile (FENAMIP), supported by the National Association of Prosecutor Employees (ANEF).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  December .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  December  and  March , FENAMIP alleges anti-union practices including the dismissal of an official, obstacles to visits by officials to members, anti-union interpretation of the rules on union leave, constraints on the representation of members in cases brought and interference in freedom of union membership, as well as the absence of negotiating procedures and impartial mechanisms for hearing labour disputes, including anti-union discrimination.
.The complainant alleges obstacles to the work of trade union officials on the part of the Public Prosecutor s Office, through constraints on their visits to members, as well as undue restrictions on the capacity to organize meetings and assemblies during the working day. The complainant alleges that: (i) on  March , the Administrator of the San Bernardo Local Prosecutor s Office informed two officials who were hoping to visit their members that the meetings could only take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and that information should be provided on the subjects that would be raised at the meetings; and (ii) in response to the formal complaint raised by the complainant against this action by the authority in Instruction FR () No. -, the Regional Prosecutor of the Western Metropolitan Regional Prosecutor s Office stated that as per article  of Law . on associations of state administration officials, prior agreement is required with the employing institution to hold assemblies and meetings during working hours. The Instruction requires a formal request to the Regional Executive Director, with at least one week s notice of the date of the meeting or assembly. The complainant considers the interpretation of the rule to be incorrect, given that the rule refers to assemblies and not to simple meetings to discuss matters of union concern, nor to simple visits and conversations between officials and members in workplaces. In FENAMIP s opinion, the Instruction is authoritarian in nature and does not leave the door open to negotiation nor to the most minimal agreement, besides establishing an unreasonable timeframe that does not allow urgent meetings to be held and seeks to control union activity. Similarly, it considers that placing an obligation to request authorization from the authority whenever an official wishes to meet a member constitutes an abnormal breach of freedom of association.
.The complainant alleges anti-union actions by the authorities of the Public Prosecutor s Office in June  in response to the submission of an appeal for protection by FENAMIP against a general instruction by the Prosecutor-Attorney of the Talagante Local Prosecutor s Office (according to the complainant, the instruction placed a block on extended vacation or leave and cancelled that which had already been granted). The complainant alleges that: (i) even though the appeal had not been officially received, it was communicated to the Prosecutor concerned through informal channels; (ii) the Prosecutor summoned the officials to a meeting on  June  to express his discontent and disappointment with the lodging of the appeal; (iii) from his head office email address, the Prosecutor sent a copy of the appeal to officials and prosecutors with the intention of making clear his unhappiness and the seriousness of the pressure he was placing on the members; (iv) the replacement Administrator of the Public Prosecutor s Office, Ms Carmen Gloria Ros, urged and encouraged workers to sign a letter rejecting the appeal; and (v) as a result, in order to denounce these facts the complainant lodged an appeal before the San Miguel Court of Appeal.
.The complainant alleges constraints placed by the authorities on the capacity to represent its members in complaints, in particular through the requirement to produce a signed authorization and, consequently, the non-recognition of the representation exercised by officials' associations. The complainant denounces the fact that, in response to the harassment at work experienced by the official, Ms Lugarda Andrade, the authorities called into question the complainant s capacity to bring an action in court for labour protection. The complainant alleges that in response to its request to reinstate the official dismissed, the Public Prosecutor stated that the complainant lacked the necessary representation. Likewise, the complainant mentions that in February  at the Libertado Bernardo O iggins Regional Prosecutor s Office, in relation to a complaint concerning irregularities on the part of a female official, the Regional Prosecutor made his assistance dependent on whether the official was in contact with the union leaders of her officials' association; and that in the same month at the Los Vilos Local Prosecutor s Office an officials' association was refused the possibility to represent a member official who was the victim of harassment at work, and a request was made for signed authorization to be produced for these purposes.
.The complainant denounces the anti-union dismissal of the union leader, Mr Mario Gutirrez Ollarz. The complainant alleges that Mr Gutirrez Ollarz led its actions to demonstrate the rejection of the project to strengthen the Public Prosecutor s Office, whereby he had to carry out acts and issue statements that were not to the liking of the Public Prosecutor, generating tensions between the two parties. At that time, Mr Gutirrez Ollarz was involved in a criminal case, as a result of which he was tried and obliged to fulfil a series of conditions, aimed at finding an alternative solution to the criminal proceedings (so-called  conditional suspension of proceedings'  through which, if the indicted person satisfies the conditions within a period specified in the respective decision, the criminal proceedings are definitively dismissed). The complainant alleges that the Public Prosecutor took advantage of this situation to terminate Mr Gutirrez Ollarz s employment, invoking sudden incapacity, in accordance with the provisions of articles  and  of the Basic Law on the Public Prosecutor s Office, in relation to article  of the Basic Courts Code and article  of the Staff Regulations for Officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office. The complainant alleges that sudden incapacity does not exist in legislation, that the reason did not apply to the official, since he was a staff member, and that it only appeared to have been applied once in the history of the Public Prosecutor s Office, despite the fact that other similar cases had existed. FENAMIP alleges that only on this occasion was the decision taken to terminate the employment, when the situation concerned a union official who led a movement of great relevance and with the aim of weakening that movement. Similarly, the complainant alleges that the rules stipulated by the law regarding trade union immunity were not observed.
.The complainant denounces the anti-union interpretation of the rules and instructions applicable to the hours of union leave. FENAMIP indicates that in  the Public Prosecutor had stated in Instruction No. / that the respective head offices were obliged to grant to the directors of associations the leave necessary to absent themselves from their work to carry out their functions, which could not be less than  hours per week for national associations or  hours per week for regional associations. The complainant alleges that, in contrast with this provision, through Instruction No. / the new National Executive Director requested union officials to provide advance information on the use of their leave time for the purposes of coordinating the sound operation of the institution and the due registration of the union hours established by the law. The complainant considers that the law had been interpreted correctly by the Public Prosecutor s Office, whereby the hours cannot be less than the values described (in other words, the law establishes minimum values with no limit); and that the National Executive Director made a fresh interpretation which considers these to be maximum values ' illegally contradicting the Public Prosecutor and with the aim of hindering the work of the workers' representatives. The complainant considers that the instruction issued by the Public Prosecutor recognizes that leave is a right of union officials of which they may avail themselves in the manner and conditions they deem relevant, provided they simply inform the authority of the use in question, whereby such information should be coordinated with the officials and not imposed in line with specific interpretations as claimed by the National Executive Director.
.The complainant denounces institutional interventions designed to generate disputes between workers' organizations and not to recognize the right of regional associations to make officials from other regions members. The complainant alleges that, pursuant to a request submitted by another union association of the Public Prosecutor s Office (which considered it inappropriate for a regional",0,2014,Chile
30,"association to be able to make officials from other regions members), the Public Prosecutor s Office requested the Labour Department to state whether activities carried out by directors of regional officials' associations, in jurisdictions of regions separate from those in which they were set up, should be considered to be union activities, and also whether it was appropriate to make membership deductions from the remuneration of officials who have decided to join an association with its headquarters in a region other than that in which the official provides his or her services. The complainant states that subject to the principle of self-regulation, the charters of its member associations allow officials from other regions to become members, and recalls that when these charters were submitted to the corresponding labour inspectorate, that body did not make any observations on them. It considers that as a result, and since it is not prohibited by law, the membership of officials who perform duties in other regions is legally acceptable, and that a public entity cannot seek to characterize as union-related or otherwise the actions or tasks performed by union officials in the exercise of their duties in other regions.
.The complainant denounces the fact that both the administrative authorities (Labour Department and National Auditor General s Office) and judicial authorities have stated that they are not competent to deal with matters concerning labour relations within the Public Prosecutor s Office, and that there is only one recognized means of representation regarding labour disputes on employment conditions within that Office: the sole internal authority is the National Executive Directorate, which establishes the service regulations, and acts as judge and party. Consequently, the complainant alleges that there is no competent impartial organization such as the judiciary to hear labour disputes between officials or prosecutors and the Public Prosecutor s Office (as an example, the complainant refers to the case of the labour dispute involving Ms Miriam Cruz who, in November , requested the unilateral amendment of her contract, and in relation to which the Court of Appeal confirmed that the labour courts were not competent, as alleged by the State Defence Council). In this connection, the complainant denounces the fact that, in response to different requests submitted by the complainant alleging unfair or anti-union practices and infringement of union rights, the State Defence Council confirmed the lack of competence of the labour courts to hear work-related cases brought by officials and stated that the complainant  is not specifically a union association' ' but an association of officials regulated by bodies of rules separate from the Labour Code '  for which  eason'  o anti-union practices can exist' in relation thereto'  The complainant alleges that the responses of the State Defence Council to these requests, the texts of which are attached to the complaint, imply that associations of officials lack any trade union rights and protection by the ordinary courts of law in respect of anti-union practices. Similarly, the complainant alleges that working conditions in the Public Prosecutor s Office are not the subject of negotiation but the result of an imposition and that there are no internal dispute settlement procedures or internal negotiating tools. As an example of constraints placed on the exercise of freedom of association by the Public Prosecutor s Office, the complainant refers to the fact that in  it was forced to seek recourse to the Santiago Court of Appeal since the Public Prosecutor s Office had refused to hand over the information necessary to defend the rights of its members. In conclusion, the complainant considers that the requirements of Articles  and  of Convention No. , ratified by Chile, which require the adoption of negotiating procedures or other methods allowing representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of conditions of employment, as well as mechanisms to settle disputes arising in connection with the determination of such conditions so as to ensure the confidence of the parties involved, are not satisfied.
.In its communication of  December , the Government forwards its observations, based mainly on the response of the Public Prosecutor s Office to the allegations. The Public Prosecutor s Office states that . per cent of its officials are members of an officials' association and that, out of the total number of members, . per cent are members of the National Association of Officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office (ANFUMIP) and . per cent belong to the complainant organization.
.As regards the allegation of obstacles to the work of union officials and undue restrictions on the capacity to organize meetings during the working day, the Public Prosecutor s Office considers that the events that occurred do not constitute an obstacle to officials' activity, nor may they be considered to be intervention in trade union activity. It recalls that the officials concerned entered the premises of the San Bernardo Local Prosecutor s Office on  March , without giving prior notice to the heads of that unit, on the assumption that they were able to interrupt, without authorization or notice, the performance of its members' work during the working day. The Public Prosecutor s Office states that Law . on associations of officials establishes what its rights are and, in relation to meetings, its states that meetings may be held during the working day provided they have been agreed in advance with the employing institution (the same treatment is accorded to private sector workers by the Labour Code). The Public Prosecutor s Office adds that arrangements have been made for meetings to be held during working hours and that the authorities of the Regional Prosecutor s Office concerned have periodic meetings with the officials of the Association of Officials of the Western Metropolitan Regional Prosecutor s Office (ASFFRO), an association affiliated to the complainant, which deal with matters of interest to the associations and seek to reach agreement on the most appropriate measures for officials. According to the Public Prosecutor s Office, within the framework of these meetings an agreement was reached with ASFFRO representatives for the institution to make arrangements to hold meetings with its members on institutional premises and also during the working day, with a requirement to request the relevant authorization. The Public Prosecutor s Office adds that ASFFRO has requested authorizations to hold meetings during the working day and that those authorizations have been granted. The Public Prosecutor s Office considers that the unplanned intervention of officials of the complainant organization in March  without prior warning or notice did not respect the agreement that the authorities had reached with its member organization, ASFFRO. Similarly, the Public Prosecutor s Office denies that officials of associations have the right to meet their members during working hours without requesting the authority s authorization. It recalls that in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , the granting of facilities to representatives of organizations shall not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned. In conclusion, the Public Prosecutor s Office recalls that the institution affords greater facilities than those required by law (such as technological resources, materials and physical spaces to hold meetings inside the institution), that it does not make the holding of meetings subject to prior authorization and that only the meetings which it wishes to hold during working hours are subject to a feasibility analysis regarding the timeliness and maintenance of institutional functions, while emphasizing that in no case is an analysis conducted of the matters to be discussed at those meetings.
.As regards the allegation of anti-union actions on the part of the authorities of the Public Prosecutor s Office in June  in the Talagante Local Prosecutor s Office in response to an appeal for protection, the Government calls into question the account and description of the facts and, while it considers that there was no anti-union action of any kind, states that: (i) the general instruction in question was a general mailing sent on  May  by the Chief Prosecutor, in which authorizations for time off or leave were made dependent on the processing of a number of cases that were being registered with no action taken; (ii) the meeting of  June was intended to discuss other subjects but, in the end, in view of the discontent that appeared to have been generated by the mailing concerning days off and leave which gave rise to the appeal, the Chief Prosecutor expressed his regret since it had not been his intention to cause such a reaction but merely to settle a work-related procedure; he also regretted that such discontent had not been expressed to him directly (the Government specifies that this was not a reproach as regards anyone s conduct or actions); (iii) the Chief Prosecutor had become aware of the appeal through the permanent monitoring by the Public Prosecutor s Office of the appeals lodged in the courts (the Government also specifies that this information is public and that from the time appeals are lodged",-1,2014,Chile
31,"the Court publishes the details on its website, which is accessible to all); (iv) the Chief Prosecutor simply forwarded the email which he received to all the officials, containing details of the lodging of the appeal but did not include any phrase or commentary and did not mention the subject again either orally or in writing; (v) the lodging of the appeal surprised many officials, some of whom expressed in emails their disagreement with the management of the association concerning the lodging of the appeal; (vi) Ms Carmen Torres Ros, who together with other officials (including one prominent union leader) signed a letter expressing her opinion and rejecting the appeal, was not serving at the time as Administrator of the Public Prosecutor s Office (contrary to the complainant s claim) and signed the letter as a member of the officials' association; (vii) in response to a denunciation of the facts the Regional Prosecutor ordered by Decision of  June  the launching of an administrative investigation, which ended in the case being dismissed owing to the fact that there was no proof of sanctionable conduct (in the investigation many officials expressed an opinion and none of them coincided with the complainant s version); (viii) FENAMIP brought a legal case based on the same facts but did not present any witnesses to support its statements; (ix) the court of first instance suggested to FENAMIP that it withdraw its appeal but, as FENAMIP did not withdraw the case, the court rejected the appeal since it considered that it was not competent to take a decision on the facts that FENAMIP, in its capacity as an association of officials, denounced as an anti-union practice; and (x) the Court of Appeal overturned the decision and ordered the case to continue; a hearing was held on  June  at which the Court proposed reconciliation, consisting of a statement by the Public Prosecutor s Office to the effect that it intended to offer respect and consideration for workers' individual and union rights (and making it completely clear that the complainant was in agreement with this solution, pending the decision to be adopted in this regard by the Public Prosecutor and the State Defence Council).
.As regards the allegations of constraints on the representation of members in work-related cases, the Government indicates, in relation to the cases mentioned concerning the Libertado Bernardo O iggins Regional Prosecutor s Office and the Los Vilos Local Prosecutor s Office, that the authorities worked jointly with the complainant in the search for solutions, that an administrative investigation was launched and that the prosecutors concerned by the facts denounced (not linked to anti-union discrimination) were sanctioned. As regards the case of harassment at work against Ms Andrade, the Government states that Ms Andrade brought legal action on three occasions and only on one of those occasions did the Supreme Court state that the court was not competent to deal with such matters. On the other two occasions, its protection actions were examined by the courts but, since there was no legal or factual basis, the cases were set aside on their merits, for which reason the claimed lack of protection for the officials alleged by the complainant does not appear to have been proven. The Government emphasizes that Ms Andrade s situation does not relate to any allegation of discrimination or anti-union practice. Similarly, the Government specifies that Ms Andrade only became a member of a FENAMIP-based association following her dismissal. As regards the alleged denial of the complainant s capacity to represent Ms Andrade as its member, the Government indicates that, in accordance with the law, associations of officials do not have the right to represent their members by asking for or requesting such personal rights as may accrue to them, unless a legally approved mandate therefor is granted. The Government adds that the complainant did not attach any documents proving that it had received such a mandate from Ms Andrade, that its submission had been presented  on behalf of the Federation'  and that the affected person had denounced the alleged unjustified dismissal individually to request compensation (but not the reinstatement requested by FENAMIP) ' this would appear to demonstrate the lack of consistency between the claims made by the complainant organization and those expressed by the person it supposedly represented.
.As to the allegation of anti-union dismissal of the union official, Mr Mario Gutirrez Ollarz, the Government specifies firstly that the draft law criticized by the complainant was also rejected by the Public Prosecutor ' Mr Gutirrez Ollarz and the Public Prosecutor retained similar opinions and the Public Prosecutor called a working meeting with the participation of all the organizations of officials and prosecutors, at which an agreement was reached on an alternative draft to be put forward to the Government. As a result, the Government refutes the alleged ill-will and states that there cannot have been any reason to weaken the trade-union action, since the union s aims coincided with the position of the Public Prosecutor. As regards the criminal proceedings, the Government states that, on  March , Mr Gutirrez Ollarz overturned the vehicle he was driving and following two breathalyser tests, it was proven that he was driving in a state of intoxication, which is a crime under Chilean law. The Government states that in the criminal case Mr Gutirrez Ollarz benefited from a conditional suspension of the proceedings. In so doing ' since there was no intervention from the authorities ' the official invoked the reason of sudden incapacity established by law. In that regard, the Government specifies that the Staff Regulations for Officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office do not establish the reason but the Regulations include the legal provisions. The Government provides detailed explanations as to how, under articles  and  of the Basic Law on the Public Prosecutor s Office and articles  and  of the Basic Code of Courts, the conditional suspension of criminal proceedings constitutes a reason for incapacity to be appointed a prosecutor or official of the Public Prosecutor s Office and, consequently, termination of duties or of an employment contract, where a cause of incapacity suddenly arises while employed. The Government states that, as a result, in strict compliance with the law, the Public Prosecutor was obliged to order the termination of Mr Gutirrez Ollarz s employment contract. Claiming the alleged unlawful nature of the Public Prosecutor s decision, Mr Gutirrez Ollarz lodged an appeal before the First Labour Court of Santiago. The Government stated that, within the framework of that ruling, on  August  Mr Gutirrez Ollarz undertook a transaction, and renounced all his allegations on the supposed illegality of the dismissal in exchange for receiving compensation of around ,, Chilean pesos (CLP) (approximating to US$,).
.In relation to the allegation of anti-union interpretation of the rules and instructions relating to union leave, the Government recalls firstly the applicable rules, contained in Law ., which state that: (i) directors have the right to leave of at least  or  hours per week, according to the type of organization (regional or national) ' hours which are considered worked and are remunerated by the institution; and (ii) there is also additional leave ' some of which must be remunerated by the institutions and other leave by the associations. The Government denies that there is any contradiction between the communications of the Public Prosecutor ' who recalls the rules on the minimum number of hours granted per week to be paid by the institution, established to protect the associations of officials ' and that of the National Executive Director ' which simply recalls the obligation to communicate the use of leave (an obligation which the complainant acknowledges in its communication). In this regard, the Government indicates that the complainant continues to fail to satisfy this obligation, and simply sends an email once a week in which it states that its directors will make use of the leave, without allowing the institutional authority to know when the official will be available to perform his or her duties (the Public Prosecutor s Office specifies that such abusive conduct is tolerated by the institutional authority, as it wishes to strengthen the organizations of officials). The Government recalls that the officials of the complainant organization enjoy a minimum of  hours per week ( for a regional organization and  for a national organization) out of the -hour working week. The Government considers that what the complainant is seeking is to enjoy unlimited union leave at the expense of the institution ' which is incompatible with the aforementioned legal rules on leave.
.As concerns the allegation of institutional interventions so as to cause disputes between workers' organizations in relation to the possibility that regional associations may make workers from other regions members, the Public Prosecutor s Office denies having interfered so as to instigate or further the dispute that has arisen. The Public Prosecutor s Office states that the dispute is",-1,2014,Chile
32,"between organizations of officials, in which the only intervention by the institutional authority was that of requesting a decision from the Labour Department, merely as a result of a denunciation made by another officials' association ' ANFUMIP. The Public Prosecutor s Office states that, in response to the practice of associations brought together in the complainant organization, whereby such associations sought to make officials from regions separate from those in which they were set up as members, officials who were members of ANFUMIP cancelled their membership in order to join these other associations. Consequently, in , ANFUMIP denounced the complainant for anti-union practices and alleged that these new memberships were illegal. On  May , the Labour Department responded to this complaint, stating that it did not have jurisdiction to take a decision on anti-union practices of officials' associations and added, in its conclusions, that  in legal terms it is unacceptable for an official of the Public Prosecutor s Office to participate in the establishment of, or to join, a regional association linked to a jurisdiction separate from that in which he or she provides services'  The Government states that, despite this ruling the complainant did not adopt any measures to rectify what it was accused of, for which reason in July  ANFUMIP requested a decision from the Public Prosecutor. In response to this request, the Public Prosecutor requested a decision from the Labour Department, so as not to become involved in a dispute between organizations of officials. In November  the Labour Department said in response that it did not have the jurisdiction to intervene in a situation such as that which had arisen in relation to memberships contracted in contravention of the law; the Department added that this was without prejudice to the right of those affected to challenge the validity of those memberships. On the basis of this decision, the Public Prosecutor s Office resolved not to order a disciplinary investigation into the denunciation made by ANFUMIP. The Public Prosecutor s Office adds that despite the clear interpretation made by the Labour Department of this matter, the complainant has not taken any action to correct the faults identified.
.As regards the allegations that impartial supervisory authorities to monitor work-related abuses, including anti-union discrimination, are absent, and internal negotiating tools, including dispute settlement processes, do not exist, the Public Prosecutor s Office states that the courts' lack of jurisdiction to hear the cases brought by the association of officials or its directors are the result of an error in the chosen procedural strategy. In relation to one of the cases mentioned by the complainant to illustrate the lack of jurisdiction alleged by the State Defence Council (the case of the labour dispute involving Ms Miriam Cruz), the Government indicates that the Supreme Court revoked the lack of jurisdiction that had been accepted by the Court of Appeal and declared that the Labour Court was competent, stating that the alleged lack of protection did not in fact exist. As regards the allegations of complaints for failure to hand over information, the Public Prosecutor s Office confirms that the complainant was obliged to seek recourse to the Court of Appeal to request that certain background materials be handed over, but states that this was a result of the obligation imposed by the Transparency Act, which requires the institution to consult the affected parties ' since those parties objected, the Public Prosecutor s Office was forced to refuse the handover, and so recourse to the Court to settle the matter was the result of the opposition of an affected third party. The Government specifies also that the complainant receives all the information it requests on subjects of interest to it. As to the general conclusions regarding lack of protection put forward by the complainant, the Public Prosecutor s Office emphasizes that the disputes may be settled by the courts and that the rejection of some of the cases brought does not mean that there is a lack of protection mechanisms, but only faults in the way in which its requests or complaints are made, or the lack of grounds therefor.
.In relation to the allusions to imposition and lack of negotiation and dialogue contained in different allegations made by the complainant, the Public Prosecutor s Office refers to various actions in which the authorities have had relations with the associations of officials during the past few years, as evidence of the collaboration with these associations since they were set up ' showing respect for their rights and in search of agreed proposals or solutions to problems or matters of interest for officials. The actions referred to include: (i) a working meeting in  with the participation of all the associations to prepare a proposal for strengthening the Public Prosecutor s Office, with the participation of FENAMIP and which culminated in an agreed draft law; (ii) a working meeting for the implementation of the Law to Strengthen the Public Prosecutor s Office ' a meeting which is fully operational; (iii) a working meeting for the regulation of labour relations, called in August , on the initiative of ANFUMIP to prepare a regulation proposal to solve the labour disputes originating within the Public Prosecutor s Office (the complainant initially refused to participate, joined in the process later and stated finally that it did not subscribe to the proposed documents (documents on labour relations, monitoring and reporting of work-related and sexual harassment, and code of good labour treatment)), since if it subscribed to those documents its aim of obtaining legal amendments allowing labour disputes in the Public Prosecutor s Office to be monitored by external bodies may be affected; (iv) a working meeting on prosecutor s office administrators (with participation of all the officials' organizations); (v) various meetings in  and  with the different associations of officials and others exclusively with the complainant to deal with subjects of interest to it, proving that associations are hosted whenever they so request; (vi) responses to various requests and consultations by the complainant, proving that a response is given to all the requests received and that where there are differences the questions are settled by the courts; and (vii) arrangements made for the associations of officials above and beyond legal requirements (for example, use of institutional mail servers, use of Public Prosecutor s Office premises for assemblies and other types of meetings during the working day or payment of expenses to directors of associations where they have to participate in meetings with the authorities).
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns allegations of anti-union practices, including the dismissal of an official, obstacles to visits by officials to members, anti-union interpretation of the rules on union leave, constraints on the representation of members in their requests and interference in freedom of membership, as well as the absence of negotiating procedures and impartial mechanisms for hearing labour disputes, including anti-union discrimination.
.As regards the allegation of obstacles to the work of trade union officials and of undue restrictions on the capacity to undertake visits and organize meetings during the working day, the Committee observes that, on the one hand, the complainant alleges the unilateral imposition of restrictions on the capacity of officials to gain access to its members, subject to the requirement of prior agreement with one week s notice for any meeting, including simple visits. On the other hand, the Committee observes that the Government considers that the complainant is defending a non-existent right to be able to disrupt without notice or prior agreement the work of its members during working hours. In this regard, the Committee must recall both the principle through which workers' representatives should be granted access to all workplaces in the undertaking where such access is necessary to enable them to carry out their representation functions, and also the principle via which the right of access to the workplace should not be exercised to the detriment of the efficient functioning of the administration or public institutions concerned. Therefore, in such cases the Committee has often stated that the workers' organizations concerned and the employer should strive to reach agreements so that access to workplaces, during and outside working hours, should be granted to workers' organizations without impairing the efficient functioning of the administration of the public institution concerned [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. In relation to this complaint, the Committee notes that the Government: states that prior to the facts denounced the authorities had already reached agreements on holding meetings and facilities granted with the regional prosecutor s organization, which was a member of the complainant organization; specifies that the authorities should simply carry out a feasibility analysis for the meetings to be held during the working day; and indicates that the requested authorizations have been granted and facilities and measures for meetings to be held that go beyond those provided for by law are granted too.
.As regards the",-1,2014,Chile
33,"allegation of anti-union actions in the Talagante Local Prosecutor s Office as a reprisal for the lodging of a protest appeal against a general instruction issued by the Public Prosecutor (public expression of disappointment, circulation of the appeal and instigation of workers to sign a rejection letter are alleged), the Committee notes the information and documentation provided by the Government, denying that the authorities intervened or carried out anti-union actions, including: the measures adopted by the administration to investigate the allegation; and the fact that a conciliation agreement appeared to have been reached at the judicial headquarters (consisting of a statement by the Public Prosecutor s Office indicating its intention to respect and consider workers' individual and union rights).
.As regards two allegations of anti-union actions and constraints on the representation of members in work-related cases before the authorities of the Public Prosecutor s Office (Libertado Bernardo O iggins Regional Prosecutor s Office and Los Vilos Local Prosecutor s Office), the Committee notes that according to the Government the authorities worked jointly with the complainant in search of solutions, an administrative investigation was launched and the prosecutors concerned were sanctioned for the facts denounced (unrelated to anti-union discrimination). As to the allegation of the refusal of the capacity to represent a female member (Ms Andrade) in court, the Committee observes that the Government indicates that the officials' associations are not entitled to act to represent their members by requesting or claiming possible personal rights that they may have, without obtaining a legally approved mandate. Similarly, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, in the case in question the complainant does not appear to have demonstrated that it acted with a mandate from its member and the members seems to have simultaneously put forward a complaint with different claims (the affected party requests compensation and the trade union her reinstatement).
.As to the allegation of the dismissal of the union official, Mr Gutirrez Ollarz, the Committee observes firstly that the complainant organization alleges the anti-union motivation of the dismissal by the Public Prosecutor s Office in order to weaken the union movement which was questioning a draft law by the Government relating to the Public Prosecutor s Office. Similarly, it observes that the complainant alleges that the reason put forward for the termination of employment (sudden incapacity where recourse to the conditional suspension of criminal proceedings has been sought) is not covered by law and that the proceedings did not respect the immunity of the trade union official. Secondly, the Committee observes that the Government indicates that the contract was terminated for legal reasons, as a result of the decision to seek recourse to the conditional suspension of criminal proceedings relating to driving in a state of intoxication. In this connection, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government on the legal basis of this case of sudden incapacity. Likewise, the Committee observes that the Government questions that there might have been any kind of anti-union motivation, since the position of the Public Prosecutor coincided with that of the complainant in rejecting the draft law. Finally, the Committee observes that, according to the information and documentation supplied by the Government, within the judicial appeal lodged against the dismissal, an agreement was reached through which Mr Gutirrez Ollarz renounced all the allegations of supposed illegality in return for compensation. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged anti-union interpretation of the rules and instructions applicable to the hours of union leave, the Committee notes that according to the Government there is no contradiction or anti-union interpretation in the communications of the competent authorities and that a minimum of  hours per week out of the -hour working week is granted to officials of the complainant organization. The Committee observes without detecting any contradiction that whereas on the one hand, the Instruction issued by the Public Prosecutor in  had recalled the minimum number of hours of weekly leave that union officials should enjoy under the law, on the other hand the Instruction issued by the National Executive Director in  reiterates the obligation to communicate the use of such leave. In this respect, the Committee must recall the principle whereby the affording of facilities to representatives of public employees, including the granting of time off, has as its corollary ensuring the  efficient operation of the administration or service concerned'  This corollary means that there can be checks on requests for time off for absences during hours of work by the competent authorities solely responsible for the  efficient operation' of their services [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Consequently, the Committee considers that the communication by the National Executive Director, which recalls the need to satisfy the obligation to communicate the use of hours of union leave, does not infringe the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegation of institutional interventions in order to generate disputes between workers' organizations concerning the possibility that regional associations may make workers from other regions members, the Committee notes that the Public Prosecutor s Office indicates that this is a dispute between organizations of officials, in which the only intervention by the institutional authority was to request a ruling from the Labour Department as a result of a denunciation made by another officials' association (which was questioning the practice of regional associations making officials from other regions members). The Committee observes that the Labour Department had considered it legally unacceptable for an official from the Public Prosecutor s Office to participate in the establishment, or to become a member, of a regional association linked to a jurisdiction separate from that where he or she provides services. While it recalls that the Committee is not competent to make recommendations on internal dissensions within a trade union organization, the Committee emphasizes that the free exercise of the right to establish and join unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition of unions [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that the associations of officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office established in one region may have officials of that Office from other regions as members, if their charters so allow.
.As to the alleged absence of impartial bodies to settle cases of work-related abuses, including anti-union discrimination, and the non-existence of internal negotiating tools, the Committee notes firstly that the Government states: that there are internal dialogue forums (and provides relevant examples), that the disputes raised can be settled by the courts, that in one of the alleged cases the Supreme Court declared that the labour courts were competent and that, in its opinion, errors had occurred in the complainant s judicial strategy. Secondly, the Committee observes that the State Defence Council has alleged that the labour courts do not have jurisdiction and has stated that the complainant is not specifically a union association but an association of officials governed by rules and laws separate from the Labour Code  for which reason, no  nti-union practices' can exist in relation thereto'  The Committee recalls that it has pointed out that Article  of Convention No.  allows a certain flexibility in the choice of procedures for the settlement of disputes concerning public servants on condition that the confidence of the parties involved is ensured. The Committee itself has stated in relation to grievances concerning anti-union practices in both the public and private sectors that such complaints should normally be examined by national machinery which, in addition to being speedy, should not only be impartial but should also be seen to be such by the parties concerned [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In the absence of further clarifications received from the Government on the applicable mechanisms for settling disputes and, in particular, the protection of officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office against anti-union discrimination, the Committee requests the Government, in the light of the aforementioned principle and within the framework of the application of Convention No.  ratified by Chile, to inform the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, to which the legislative aspects of the case are referred, of the dispute settlement mechanisms relating to the determination of employment conditions and of the applicable machinery, remedies and sanctions to ensure that officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office enjoy adequate protection against any act of anti-union discrimination.
.Finally, in the light of the foregoing conclusions and taking note with interest of the fact that, according to the Government, there are various bodies for dialogue which deal with issues concerning associations of officials (working meetings, including a meeting to deal with labour relations), the Committee encourages the competent authorities to continue deepening social dialogue with the associations of officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office in order to promote harmonious collective relations and, in line with the aforementioned principles of freedom of association, to reach shared",-1,2014,Chile
34,"agreements on the issues that may remain pending in relation to the access of union officials to their members during the working day; the union leave of officials and communication of its use; and the development and use of negotiating procedures between the authorities and associations of officials, and other methods allowing their participation in the determination of employment conditions.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that the associations of officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office established in one region may have officials of that Office from other regions as members, if their charters so allow.(b) The Committee requests the Government, within the framework of the application of Convention No.  ratified by Chile, to inform the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, to which the legislative aspects of the case are referred, of the dispute settlement mechanisms relating to the determination of employment conditions and of the applicable machinery, remedies and sanctions to ensure that officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office enjoy adequate protection against any act of anti-union discrimination.(c) The Committee encourages the competent authorities to continue deepening social dialogue with the associations of officials of the Public Prosecutor s Office in order to guarantee the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned, and to promote harmonious collective relations and, in line with the aforementioned principles of freedom of association, to reach shared agreements on the issues that may remain pending in relation to the access of union officials to their members during the working day; the union leave of officials and communication of its use; and the development and use of negotiating procedures between the authorities and associations of officials, and other methods allowing their participation in the determination of employment conditions.",-1,2014,Chile
35,".The complaint is contained in communications of the National Confederation of Workers of the Bread and Food Industry (CONAPAN), the National Federation of Unions of Bus and Truck Drivers, and Related Activities of Chile (FENASICOCH), the Inter-Company Union of Workers of Lder Supermarkets, the Federation of United Workers Trade Unions (AGROSUPER), the Inter-Company Union of Contractor Company Workers (SITEC), the Inter-Company Union of Actors of Chile (SIDARTE), the Inter-Company National Union of Professionals and Technicians of the Film and Audio-visual Sector (SINTECI), the Federation of ENAP Contractor Workers of Concn, the Inter-Company Union of Professional Footballers, the Federation of Trade Unions of Workers of ISS Holding Companies and Subsidiaries, and General Services (FETRASSIS) and the Inter-Company Union of Domestic Workers, dated  April and  July  (received by the Office on  September ).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  April and  July , the National Confederation of Workers of the Bread and Food Industry (CONAPAN), the National Federation of Unions of Bus and Truck Drivers, and Related Activities of Chile (FENASICOCH), the Inter-Company Union of Workers of Lder Supermarkets, the Federation of United Workers Trade Unions (AGROSUPER), the Inter-Company Union of Contractor Company Workers (SITEC), the Inter-Company Union of Actors of Chile (SIDARTE), the Inter-Company National Union of Professionals and Technicians of the Film and Audio-visual Sector (SINTECI), the Federation of ENAP Contractor Workers of Concn, the Inter-Company Union of Professional Footballers, the Federation of Trade Unions of Workers of ISS Holding Companies and Subsidiaries, and General Services (FETRASSIS), and the Inter-Company Union of Domestic Workers, allege that inter-company unions are legally defined in Chilean legislation as  ...unions representing workers of two or more different employers;' (section (b) of the Labour Code). The complainant organizations state that they represent thousands of workers in a large number of production activities in various industrial, manufacturing and services sectors in Chile that are essential for the country s development, such as retail, transport, food, mining, energy (fuel and hazardous substances), arts and communications, industrial cleaning services, and the services provided by domestic workers, actors and professional footballers.
.However, the legislation makes the fundamental and basic right of the inter-company unions to represent their members in collective bargaining exclusively dependent on the willingness of employers: they decide whether they wish to engage in bargaining. Furthermore, if companies do agree to negotiations, the procedure is not regulated, that is there is no protection for workers, no trade union immunity nor the right to strike.
.The complainants explain that, in Chile, companies have a guaranteed constitutional right to engage in any kind of economic activity. The right to property gives employers extensive powers and protection, exceeding the provisions of basic social rights; the management and administrative powers of employers are fully protected, and they are fully entitled to organize themselves. They organize themselves under this framework, creating companies, reorganizing them through mergers and demergers; they can generate various business names to hide their real identity; and they can outsource all their services and production, including their own principal business line. This naturally leads to the fragmentation and weakening of trade unions. According to official statistics, . per cent of production units have not engaged in collective bargaining in the last five years.
.For instance, in the retail and supermarket sector, there are large chains in which each shop has a different business name, whereby the best means of uniting and bridging gaps to establish a balance of power between the company and the workers is the creation of inter-company trade unions, simply because, in practice, one company can make itself look like several smaller companies.
.In the transport sector there are various factors such as geography, the distance covered by road transport, work dynamics due to long-distance travel and a company s drivers being spread out in different parts of the country. This justifies the exercise of the right to organize through inter-company unions. Conditions in the transport sector are similar to the conditions of bakery and cleaning workers, who work on their own, or who carry out their activities or share a workplace with a very small number of fellow workers.
.According to the complainants, another characteristic of certain sectors in which inter-company unions operate is that they rely heavily on outsourcing, as in the case of communications experts and professionals, who are linked to television companies through one or more intermediate companies; this is also the case of workers in subcontractor companies, where the principal companies operate by breaking down and outsourcing their processes, thereby not appearing to be the employers and those responsible for the overall and final control of working conditions. There are also many other sectors in which workers see their collective power undermined by the high level of business fragmentation that companies often pursue on false pretences.
.Given the option between two inter-company trade unions, an employer can choose to bargain with one and discriminate against the other without providing any justification for its decision.
.The complainants indicate that the system in Chile works as follows: once inter-company unions have met a number of legal requirements, they submit a draft collective agreement to the company or companies, which then have ten working days to communicate their discretionary decision to agree or refuse to enter into bargaining, without needing to provide a reason. If, by some miracle, they agree to enter into bargaining, the workers listed on the draft agreement run the risk of being dismissed, given that they are not legally protected by any kind of immunity during the bargaining process. The law does not provide any legal means of pressure, given that inter-company unions do not have the right to strike.
.In most cases, companies do not recognize the right to collective bargaining of inter-company trade unions, which have to be creative in finding alternative means of representing their members and bargaining. Some of these trade unions are obliged to hide behind the faade of negotiating groups, which are an anti-union practice, or simply to use collective strike action with the risk of disciplinary consequences for participants.
.Before , road transport workers protected their conditions of pay and other benefits through collective bargaining similar to bargaining at the level of branch of activity, where the State established conditions such as travel allowances and a percentage for lorry sales, which have never since been required of workers. This sector is present throughout the country s productive industries and has, up till now, not been able to recover the possibility of bargaining at the level of branch of activity.
.The complainant organizations indicate that a special case is that of art and communications professionals (actresses and actors), who have been excluded from the Labour Code in practice by being put under pressure by television companies to register themselves as sole proprietorships, thereby undermining their identity as workers, even though the relationship of subordination and dependency continues on a permanent basis. The cinema and audio-visual industry works on the basis of fixed-term arrangements, by project or job (such as adverts, television series, documentaries or Chilean films). Accordingly, workers may have several employers throughout the year, which was the reason for creating an inter-company union. Likewise, the trade union in the National Copper Corporation of Chile (CODELCO) was created with the aim of responding to new ways of organizing work (outsourcing and workforce specialization were previously mainly used for work which fell outside the industry s core areas of expertise).
.According to the allegations, the above points to a clear violation of ILO Conventions Nos  and  in practice. Inter-company unions are discriminated against with respect to company unions, which can engage in bargaining without the employer s consent, and it is not uncommon that when a worker decides to join a union or take on a leading role within a union, the company immediately takes retaliatory action to prevent said decision.
.Lastly, the complainant organizations reiterate that the trade unions are made up of workers and that they are the ones who must decide which trade union they wish to join and be represented by in all the areas laid down by the union constitution, including in the area of collective bargaining.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government considers that, as regards the allegations made by the complainant trade union organizations, there has been no violation of freedom of association by the State of Chile. The above is without prejudice to errors or differences of opinion in considering the facts that may exist between the parties and that have been settled through the institutional procedures provided for in Chile, whether in administrative or judicial courts.
.In this regard, the Government indicates that the Political Constitution of the Republic, under article , paragraph , states that:  The Constitution grants everyone equality before the law. In Chile no privileges are given",0,2014,Chile
36,"to any person or group. In Chile there are no slaves and whoever sets foot on its territory is free. Men and women are equal before the law. Neither the law nor any other authority may create arbitrary differences.' Article , paragraph , states that:  The Constitution guarantees the right to organize for all in the cases and under the procedures established by law  ?,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Labour Code also establishes the following:?Section   cts of discrimination are contrary to the principles of labour law.Acts of discrimination are distinctions, exclusions or preferences on the basis of race, colour, sex, age, civil status, union membership, religion, political opinion, nationality, national extraction or social origin, which seek to undermine or alter equality of opportunity or treatment in employment and occupation.?Section . Workers in the private sector and in state-owned companies, whatever their legal status, have the right to establish, without prior permission, the trade unions that they consider appropriate, the only condition being that they abide by the rules and constitutions of such bodies.?Section . Minors do not require permission to become members of a trade union, or to participate in its administration and management.Membership of a trade union is voluntary, personal and may not be delegated.No one may be obliged to become a member of a trade union organization in order to take up a job or carry out an activity. Nor should they be prevented from leaving a trade union.  	Section . The employment of a worker may not be made conditional on membership of or withdrawal from a trade union organization. In the same way, a worker may not be prevented or hindered from joining a trade union, or dismissed or prejudiced in any way due to trade union membership or participation in trade union activities.?Section . Trade unions shall be constituted and named in accordance with the workers who become members. Among others, the following may be created:(a)	company unions: representing workers of one and the same company;(b)	inter-company unions: representing workers of two or more different employers;(c)	independent worker unions: representing workers who do not work for any employer; and(d)	unions for occasional or transitory workers: representing workers who are employed for seasonal or intermittent periods.
.The Government also indicates that the legislation in force not only establishes the right to organize, elevating it to the status of a constitutional guarantee, but it also protects it by prohibiting its use as a means of discrimination. Regarding the specific case of inter-company unions, they are specifically provided for and described in the aforementioned section , paragraph (b), of the Labour Code; it is therefore not true that they are not legally recognized in Chile. In order to initiate collective bargaining proceedings, that kind of trade union has two alternatives:?The procedure laid down in section  of the Labour Code, in other words, attempting to reach a prior agreement with the employer or employers. In this case, the presentation of the draft collective agreement requires trade unions to meet two requirements: ' a) The respective trade union organization(s) shall reach a prior agreement with the respective employer(s), in writing and before a notary public'  and ' b) In the company concerned, an absolute majority of worker members entitled to engage in collective bargaining shall confer, by secret ballot, representation on the trade union concerned in an assembly and in the presence of a qualified witness' ?Directly presenting a draft collective agreement in accordance with the provisions under section bis of the aforementioned legal text. In this case, even when, due to its legal status, the inter-company union represents workers of more than one employer, it is entitled to present a draft collective agreement, in representation of its members and of the workers who become members, to the employers of workers who are members of that trade union, without the prior consent of the respective employer or employers, as required by the rule governing the aforementioned procedure. It should be noted that, in this second procedure, negotiation with the inter-company trade union is voluntary or optional for the employer, but if it declines to enter into negotiations, which must be notified within a period of ten days, members of the trade union working for the same employer are entitled to bargain collectively in accordance with the general rules established by the Labour Code.
.The Government indicates that, according to the official figures issued by the Labour Directorate, which is the technical body in charge of the registration of collective agreements, a total of  such agreements were registered in , a total of  in  and to date,  collective agreements have been registered in . The above amounts to a total of  agreements, resulting from collective inter-company bargaining, directly benefiting , workers.
.In the light of the above, it is considered that the inter-company collective bargaining model, despite its imperfections and differences in its interpretation, has been applied effectively, leading to many improvements in the working conditions of thousands of workers.
.The Government reports that it is currently in the process of carrying out a reform to modernize the industrial relations system. With this objective, the Government submitted for examination (Official Gazette No. -) the draft act introducing the necessary amendments to the Labour Code, seeking to guarantee a balance between the parties and the full respect of freedom of association. This draft act (which the Government attaches to its reply) not only seeks to amend the current regulation of the right to strike, in order to strengthen its exercise, but it also makes the workers who are members of the trade union eligible to bargain collectively, prohibiting negotiation groups in those companies and regulating the existence of minimum bargaining rights and the extension of benefits.
.As regards the allegations contained in the complaint, the Government indicates that the draft Act, currently under examination, recognizes the right of inter-company unions to bargain in the companies in which they have an equivalent number of members to that required for the creation of a company union for the purposes of bargaining, thereby giving them the necessary rights to act on behalf of their members. Evidence of the above is the wording of the draft, under section , which was recently approved by the chamber of representatives as follows:Section . ollective bargaining by inter-company unions. Inter-company unions may bargain in accordance with the collective bargaining procedure established in Title IV of this Book, pursuant to the amendments established in this Chapter. In this last case, the company may not refuse to enter into bargaining.
.As of  March , the draft was qualified as urgent in the National Congress and is currently under examination by the National Senate at the second constitutional level, the general idea of legislating having been approved by a vote of  August , which gave rise to the period during which the Government can present its observations.
.In the light of all the clarifications set out above and the current reform process on the legal framework for collective bargaining, the Government considers that the complaint is unfounded.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that: (i) the inter-company unions ( ...representing workers of two or more employers' (section (b), of the Labour Code)) have not been guaranteed the fundamental right to represent their members in collective bargaining, given that this depends on a decision by the employer as to whether it wishes to engage in negotiations, whereby if the employer does agree to enter into negotiations, these are conducted outside the regulated procedure, without any protection against dismissal for the workers covered by the draft collective agreement (not participating in negotiations) and without being able to exercise the right to strike; (ii) this situation hampers bargaining in certain areas of activity and the representation and bargaining of workers who perform the same services (such as domestic workers, bakers, drivers, etc.), especially given that companies can fragment their structures, generating various business names in different parts of the country; (iii) in some cases, such as that of actors, workers are put under pressure to register themselves as sole proprietorships, even though their relationship of subordination and dependency continues; and (iv) some inter-company unions are obliged, in this context, to resort to the anti-union practice of forming  workers' groups' or to use collective actions such as strikes, exposing themselves to legal sanctions as they do not have the right to strike. According to the complainants, the natural consequence of the above is trade union fragmentation and the consequent weakening of trade unions, which is the objective that has been pursued on many occasions.
.The Committee takes note of the legal and constitutional provisions in force, as set out by the Government in its reply and in its explanation of their scope, and the statistics on the number of collective agreements concluded by inter-company trade unions and their coverage of workers. The Committee also takes note of the Government s opinion that the legislation in force does not violate freedom of association and that the",-1,2014,Chile
37,"complaint addresses problems that have been resolved by the relevant authorities, either through the administrative or the judicial courts; the Government s reply indicates that, with certain majorities, the inter-company trade union may bargain collectively (section  of the Labour Code).
.The Committee also notes that the Government reports on a partial draft reform of the Labour Code as regards labour relations, which is under examination by the National Congress. The Committee notes that the Government declares that the draft in question: () recognizes the right of inter-company unions to bargain in companies (without companies being able to oppose this) when they have attained the number of members required for the establishment of a company union, thereby granting them the rights required to act on behalf of their members; () authorizes inter-company unions to use the regulated procedure for other types of trade unions, thereby granting members  bargaining immunity' (protection against dismissal); () prohibits the existence of negotiating groups (of workers); and () regulates the existence of minimum bargaining rights and the extension of benefits.
.The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of the act amending the Labour Code as soon as it is adopted which, according to all information from the Government, recognizes the right to strike of inter-company unions. The Committee observes that the draft act addresses some of the points highlighted by the complaint in a manner that would bolster the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Noting that the partial draft reform of the Labour Code, currently under examination, contains provisions which address some of the points raised in the complaint in a manner so as to bolster the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of the act as soon as it is adopted.",2,2014,Chile
38,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the No.  Trade Union of Carozzi Enterprises SA dated  May , supported by the Amalgamated Workers' Union of Chile (CUT) in a communication of  November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the No.  Trade Union of Carozzi Enterprises SA alleges anti-union practices by Carozzi Enterprises SA, beginning in August  (following a collective bargaining procedure as a part of which the complainant organization held a strike between  July and  August ) with the aim of undermining the existence of the trade union and disrupting its continuity.
.The complainant organization states that, on  March , it filed an administrative complaint with the labour inspectorate for the following anti-union practices: economic discrimination and pressure from the enterprise to dissuade individuals from joining the trade union or to encourage its existing members to resign or to switch trade unions, as well as dismissals on the basis of participation in the  strike, or of opposition to the enterprise s demand that employees should change into and out of their working clothes outside of working hours.
.The complainant organization states that the labour inspectorate (inspection report No. //) noted the following: (i) the trade union exercised its right to strike as a part of a collective bargaining process, from  July to  August , when it invoked its right under Section  of the Labour Code to call on the employer to sign a new collective agreement with the same terms as those in the contracts in force; (ii) in January , the trade union and the enterprise entered into a new collective bargaining process arising from a complaint of anti-union practices filed by the trade union with the labour inspectorate, which led to the signing of a collective agreement on  January, under which a number of benefits were agreed on, including a , Chilean peso (CLP) end-of-dispute bonus; (iii) between the end of the strike in August  and February , the enterprise terminated  labour relationships '  owing to alleged business needs (affecting  members of the complainant organization),  by mutual agreement,  on the basis of voluntary redundancy (affecting four members) and eight for alleged dereliction of duty (affecting three members); (iv) during the same period,  individuals were recruited (including  protection agents, at a time when the employment contracts of  workers carrying out that same role had been terminated); (v) from August  to February ,  workers resigned from the complainant organization and the number of members fell from  to ; (vi) in , there were two wage adjustments relating to another trade union organization present within the enterprise. The first readjustment was carried out in July  (according to the enterprise, it was a legal readjustment that was applied to all the workers, except for those belonging to the complainant organization, who were excluded on the basis that Section  of the Labour Code, which had provided the grounds for the extension of the agreement requested by the complainant organization, establishes that the extension shall not include the terms relating to the readjustment of wages and other benefits). The second wage readjustment was carried out in December  (the result of collective bargaining involving the second trade union, referred to above, which led to the signing of a collective agreement on  December . That agreement provided for a number of benefits, including a CLP, end-of-dispute bonus for the trade union s members); and (vii) on examining the wages for the month of January  paid to ten workers who resigned from the complainant organization, it becomes clear that they were each paid the sum of CLP, but that the  per cent of the union dues corresponding to the complainant organization was collected from only one of those workers. In the case of the other workers, the dues were collected for the other trade union organizations present within the enterprise.
.The complainant organization refers to the following legal conclusions of the lawyer responsible for the inspection carried out by the labour inspectorate: (i) the enterprise did not have any grounds for not paying the July  wage readjustment to the complainant organization s members, given that, contrary to the enterprise s claims, the Labour Code regulation invoked (Section ) does not contain any prohibitions relating to the application of readjustments; (ii) the  per cent of the union dues of all of the workers who received the CLP, bonus negotiated by the complainant organization should have been collected for that same organization, the enterprise having therefore acted in an unreasonable manner in that regard; and (iii) he stated that the fact that  of the  dismissals carried out by the enterprise had been based on business needs and circumstances, when those very same conditions had necessitated the recruitment of  new workers during the same period, gave cause for concern.
.The complainant organization states that, during a subsequent mediation session on  May , the enterprise pleaded ignorance of the events and evidence noted by the labour inspectorate and, consequently, a complaint was filed with the competent court on  May . The complainant organization attaches the corresponding legal ruling of  December , in which the Labour Court of First Instance of Valparaso concluded that the enterprise had engaged in anti-union practices relating to the complainant organization, it having been proven that most of the workers dismissed had belonged to the complainant organization, that pressure had been put on members to resign from the trade union and that economic discrimination had been employed, undermining the functioning of the trade union, discouraging potential members and encouraging existing members to resign. Consequently, the Court ruled that the enterprise must pay a fine of  tax units.
.Furthermore, the complainant organization states that a number of its members were dismissed for having exercised their right to change into their work clothes during working hours (the enterprise claimed that workers should change their clothes prior to entering the workplace). In support of its position, the complainant organization refers to a legal opinion of the Legal Department of the Labour Directorate of  January , according to which workers must be paid for time spent changing into regulation work clothes. In support of its allegations, the complainant organization refers to a ruling of the Labour Court of First Instance of Valparaso of  November , according to which three members of the complainant organization (Mr Torres Gajardo, Mr Aza Flores and Ms Silva Flores), whose work contracts had been terminated after three warnings for having continued to clock in and out of work while wearing non-work clothes, had been wrongfully dismissed.
.Lastly, the complainant organization refers to a further example of anti-union discrimination in the form of the dismissal of a worker (Ms Tabilo Cisternas) on  October ,  days after she joined the complainant organization (at the time, she was the only person to have done so since the  strike). The complainant organization refers to the ruling of the Labour Court of First Instance of Valparaso of  June , in which the Court held the dismissal to be an act of anti-union discrimination and ordered the enterprise to pay a fine of  per cent for wrongful dismissal, amounting to CLP, and CLP,, in compensation (adding up to approximately US$,).
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that, in addition to the complaint of  March  referred to in the preceding paragraphs, between  and , the complainant organization filed the following complaints for violation of fundamental rights, resulting in a number of administrative and judicial procedures: (i) a complaint dated  July  of dismissal of union members for having joined the complainant organization and failure to collect the  per cent of the trade union dues (in that regard, the labour inspectorate only found that the trade union members had been dismissed and the Labour Court of First Instance of Valparaso, in its ruling of  June , found that it had not been proven that anti-union practices had been carried out); (ii) a complaint of  May  of illegal dismissal of workers covered by trade union immunity during collective bargaining (with regard to which the court ordered that such conduct should cease and that the workers should be reinstated and paid their wages; requirements that the enterprise subsequently met); (iii) a complaint of  August  of failure to pay trade union leave in full (the labour inspectorate did not find any evidence of the practice in question); (iv) a complaint of  September  of discrimination on the basis of trade union membership (the labour inspectorate noted that there was a",0,2013,Chile
39,"special clocking-in system for workers who were members of the complainant organization and, although no agreement was reached, the Office of the Public Prosecutor deemed that the reparations offered by the enterprise were sufficient and decided not to bring the matter before the competent court); (v) a complaint of  October  of acts of discrimination (the labour inspectorate found evidence of harmful practices in the form of an agreement to include in a collective instrument a clause on the payment of trade union leave on terms that were more favourable for one of the three trade unions concerned than for the other two; that situation led to judicial conciliation resulting in an undertaking from the enterprise to treat all trade unions equally); and (vi) a complaint of  February  of anti-union practices and discrimination on the basis of trade union membership (in its ruling of  January , the Labour Court of First Instance of Valparaso stated that it had not been proven that anti-union activities had been carried out).
.Furthermore, the Government reports that, in a letter of  February , the enterprise refuted the complainant organization s allegations relating to the dismissals, that two other trade unions are present within the enterprise in addition to the complainant organization and that the enterprise has a policy of respecting its workers' forms of organization, allowing them every opportunity to carry out trade union activities and providing them with the necessary facilities.
.The Government concludes by stating that the labour inspectorate carried out all its duties in compliance with the law, bringing any cases in which it had uncovered evidence of violations of freedom of association before the competent courts. Moreover, it adds that the competent court rejected the complaints following deliberations carried out in line with due process.
.Lastly, the Government states that it proposed that the regulations governing the classification and sanctioning of anti-union and unfair practices in collective bargaining should be revised as a part of the bill modernizing the labour relations system that was submitted as a part of the legislative process on  December . It is hoped that the bill will provide an opportunity to address the shortcomings affecting the legislation safeguarding freedom of association.
.The Committee notes that the allegations of anti-union practices raised by the complainant were investigated by the labour inspectorate and were the subject of a number of judicial rulings. As to the results of those procedures, the Committee notes that the labour inspection reports established that there was evidence of anti-union discrimination on various occasions. While in two of the rulings referred to by the Government relating to previous complaints not mentioned by the complainant, the competent court ruled that there was no evidence of anti-union discrimination, in a number of other rulings, provided by the complainant organization, the competent court ruled that the enterprise had carried out acts of anti-union discrimination  oth in general, referring to various practices designed to impede the functioning of the organization and to reduce its membership, and to specific cases of dismissal of its members.
.While observing that the complainant s allegations were submitted to the competent national administrative and judicial bodies and expressing concern at the acts of anti-union discrimination established in the rulings of those bodies, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps (such as facilitating dialogue between the enterprise and the complainant organization) to help prevent any new conflicts of a similar nature, in particular, any act of anti-union discrimination, from arising within the enterprise in question.
.The Committee notes that the competent court ordered the enterprise in question to pay a fine which, according to the Government, amounted to the equivalent of approximately US$,, deeming that it had been proven that most of the workers dismissed had been members of the complainant, that members had been put under pressure to resign from the complainant and that economic discrimination had been employed; forms of conduct which had impeded the functioning of the trade union, reducing its membership. Given the serious nature of the allegations, the Committee expresses its concern at the failure to impose a sanction sufficiently dissuasive to prevent such acts from being carried out again in the future, in particular taking into account the fact that the court considered that the enterprise had engaged repeatedly in anti-union practices. In this regard, the Committee welcomes the willingness expressed by the Government to revise the regulations governing the classification and sanctioning of anti-union practices in order to address any shortcomings in the legislation in full consultation with the social partners, and requests the Government to inform the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, to which it refers the legislatives aspects of this case, of the measures taken in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	While observing that the complainant s allegations were submitted to the competent national administrative and judicial bodies, and expressing its concern at the acts of anti-union discrimination established in the rulings of those bodies, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps, such as facilitating dialogue between the enterprise and the complainant organization, to help prevent any new conflicts of a similar nature, in particular, acts of anti-union discrimination, within the enterprise in question.(b)	The Committee welcomes the willingness expressed by the Government to revise the regulations governing the classification and sanctioning of anti union practices in order to address any shortcomings in the legislation in full consultation with the social partners, and requests the Government to inform the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, to which it refers the legislatives aspects of this case, of the measures taken in this regard.",2,2013,Chile
40,".The Committee examined this case, in which the complainant organization alleges restrictions to its president s access to workplaces, unilateral reductions and discrimination in relation to union leave, non-compliance with collective agreements, anti-union dismissals, exclusion and questioning of trade union work, the use of a bonus to promote early, unregulated collective bargaining and impediments to the exercise of the right to strike by the Chilean Chemical and Mining Enterprise (hereinafter  the enterprise'  and its subsidiaries, at its March  session [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide additional information to the Government concerning the allegation that its president has been denied access to the mining sites of the enterprise, so as to enable the Government to investigate should this concern persist. The Committee also invites the Government to obtain information in this respect from the enterprise through the employers' organization concerned, and requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(b)	While acknowledging the efforts made by the competent authorities to resolve the issues relating to trade union leave, the Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information regarding the handling of the allegations of anti-union dismissals through indiscriminate reliance on the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, including any relevant administrative or court decisions, expecting that, if acts of anti-union discrimination have been committed, adequate compensatory measures and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions are imposed. The Committee invites the complainant organization to provide any additional information that it may have in connection with these proceedings, in particular any legal action taken in that regard.(c) The Committee invites the Government to take the necessary initiatives to enhance dialogue between the enterprise and the complainant organization, with a view to preventing similar disputes in the future and promoting the exercise of freedom of association, and to keep it informed in that regard.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government submitted its observations in respect of the Committee s recommendations. The Government states that: (i) it requested a detailed report from the Regional Labour Directorate of the Antofagasta Region and summoned the complainant organization to verify whether the enterprise had brought its procedures into line with the law and had refrained from violating the rights of its workers and hindering the work of its officials; (ii) a labour reform undertaken in  represents significant progress in relation to the exercise of the right to bargain collectively and to protection against dismissals and anti-union discrimination; (iii) this reform could make it possible to improve the quality of dialogue between the enterprise and its workers; and (iv) the next negotiations to be carried out at the enterprise will have to be conducted under the terms of the aforementioned labour reform.
.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government. With regard to the allegation that the president of the complainant organization was denied access to the mining sites of the enterprise (recommendation (a)), the Committee notes that the complainant organization has not provided the additional information requested of it, either directly or through the Government, despite having been invited by the Government to do so. With regard to the handling of the allegations of anti-union dismissals (recommendation (b)), the Committee notes the Government s indication that the  labour reform increased protection against anti-union dismissals. It notes, however, that neither the Government nor the complainant organization, which had been invited to provide additional information, provided new information concerning the allegations made in the context of the present case. In these circumstances and based on the above elements, the Committee considers that this case is closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in communications of  March,  May and  October  from the Third Federation of Workers of the Chilean Chemical and Mining Enterprise.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  March,  May and  October , the Third Federation of Workers of SQM alleges restrictions to its president s access to workplaces, discrimination in relation to union leave, non-compliance with collective agreements, anti-union dismissals, exclusion and questioning of trade union work, the use of a bonus to promote early, unregulated collective bargaining and impediments to the exercise of the right to strike, by SQM and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, the complainant alleges passivity and failure to respond on the part of the competent authority.
.First, the complainant alleges that for the last eight years, the enterprise has denied the President of the Third Federation of Workers of SQM, Mr Nelson Prez, access to SQM work facilities, which not only constitutes anti-union conduct but also discrimination, given that the presidents of the other two union federations are allowed access.
.Second, the complainant alleges unilateral reductions and discrimination by the enterprise in granting union leave. It indicates that it was the enterprise s ongoing and constant practice over more than thirty years ' which, it considers, constitutes a tacit clause ' to grant and pay union leave exceeding the minimum amounts provided for under the law. The complainant reports that in December , the enterprise announced unilateral changes to the contractual conditions of union officials, changing the requirements for requesting union leave and indicating that hours of union leave would thereafter be deducted from wages. The complainant alleges that those deductions have only been applied to its officials.
.Third, the complainant alleges dismissals of its members and officials on account of their union membership and participation in union activities through the indiscriminate reliance on the provisions of article  of the Labour Code (enterprise requirements). The complainant alleges that when its members participate in an assembly and express their opinion regarding working conditions in the enterprise, they are dismissed the following day on the grounds of enterprise requirements and non-existent restructuring, with a view to intimidating workers into not expressing their opinion or participating in unions that belong to the complainant organization. Furthermore, the complainant organization alleges that, following the collective bargaining procedure entered into by two of its member unions (the first and second unions of the Antofagasta carbonate and lithium hydroxide plants), which concluded with an agreement in May  with the mediation of the labour inspectorate, and after the union members' immunity had expired,  workers were dismissed progressively at the beginning and the end of each shift to intimidate the remaining workers (the complainant provides many records of conciliation meetings before the labour inspectorate in which dismissed workers allege the unjustified application of the provisions under article  of the Labour Code). The complainant adds that in , another member union in the federation (the Trade Union of Nueva Victoria de Iquique) had been subject to the same treatment, whereby  union members were dismissed once their trade union immunity for collective bargaining expired. The complainant considers that, although the enterprise relies on the clause on enterprise requirements, these are measures of anti-union discrimination against officials and trade unions that report bad practices. Lastly, the complainant reports that in the Salar del Carmen worksite, workers were threatened with dismissal if they refused to transfer to another union, which is what happened to the workers who did not (the complainant provides as an example the dismissal of three union members and notes that the workers who did transfer to another union retained their jobs). The complainant organization alleges that, as a result of these dismissals, in Salar del Carmen the union officials are the only workers who have remained in their unions.
.Fourth, the complainant alleges various instances in which the enterprise has not complied with the collective agreement in relation to: the obligation to provide work clothing for its members (using sizing problems as an excuse for not providing workwear); the provisions on wages (non-compliance and unilateral amendments); and the payment of sick leave.
.Fifth, the complainant alleges that the enterprise implemented a  General Role Target Compliance Bonus' with a view to impeding the free exercise of the right to strike, by making payment of the bonus conditional on collective bargaining taking place early and on an unregulated basis. The complainant points out that the possibility of recourse to strike action is an element of regulated collective bargaining. Trade union organizations are entitled to bargain collectively within a stipulated period ( to  days) prior to the expiry of a collective agreement, and as part of such bargaining, workers can vote on whether they will accept the last offer made by the employer or take strike action (this is not a possibility in early, unregulated bargaining). The complainant alleges that introducing a bonus contingent on early, unregulated bargaining violates the exercise of freedom of association by limiting the possibility of resorting to strike action. The complainant indicates that,",-1,2013,Chile
41,"as a result of this payment incentive, union representatives have felt obligated to enter into early, unregulated bargaining, under pressure from members who wish to receive the bonus. It adds that the bonus has even been paid in advance, on the condition that if early bargaining did not occur, the bonus paid would then be deducted from the worker s earnings. The complainant organization indicates that this practice was reported to the labour inspectorate and that, on  January , the Labour Court of Antofagasta ruled that the condition for the payment of the bonus was illegal and that the enterprise had committed anti-union practices by restricting the workers' right to choose freely and voluntarily whether or not they wished to engage in regulated collective bargaining. The complainant organization adds that the enterprise filed an appeal against this ruling before the Court of Appeal.
.Sixth, the complainant reports that the enterprise is constantly questioning union work and excludes its federation from dialogue relating to the adoption of measures affecting all workers. In this regard, the complainant indicates that, in order to come to an agreement on the aforementioned bonus, the enterprise met with two other federations but, in discriminatory manner, did not invite the complainant. Furthermore, the complainant alleges that a supervisor has constantly discredited its members and officials, setting managers against workers by making untrue and distorted statements and disclosing confidential information. It indicates that this allegation was reported to the labour inspector.
.In its communication of  February , the Government transmitted the observations of the Labour Directorate, of the Ministry of Mining and of the SQM enterprise in response to the complainant s allegations.
.As regards the allegation of the unilateral change to a tacit clause established through the ongoing practice of granting and paying union leave exceeding the minimum legal amounts, the enterprise denies any discriminatory treatment. The enterprise recognizes that, for a long time, it granted union leave exceeding the legal minimum and that it covered the costs of the leave. The enterprise indicates that as a result of this practice, many union officials had stopped performing their work duties and that it had therefore decided to end the practice and, without any discrimination, require that all union officials effectively perform their duties. The Government reports that, in the complaint filed on  May  by three officials of a member union of the complainant organization, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate ruled that there was evidence of anti-union practices and, after legal action was taken, the proceedings were concluded on  March  through conciliation. Under these conciliation proceedings, the parties agreed that: (i) union officials would thereafter only use union leave in accordance with the provisions set out in the Labour Code, without prejudice to union leave established under collective agreements; (ii) union leave taken until that time which exceeded the legal minimum would not be considered as unjustified absences, and would not result in sanctions or affect the payment of wages; and (iii) full effect would be given to the communications sent by the enterprise regarding the use of union leave. Moreover, the President of the complainant organization, Mr Nelson Prez, reached these same agreements with the enterprise through a mediation agreement on  April . These mediation proceedings also considered the complaint filed by the president of the complainant organization, alleging that the enterprise was not assigning him his contractual work, or the necessary means to perform it; the parties agreed under the mediation agreement that the enterprise would assign Mr Nelson Prez his contractual work, and provide the other means to enable him to access the workplace to perform his duties.
.Concerning the allegations of dismissals of union members and officials on account of their union membership and participation in union activities through the indiscriminate application of the provisions of article  of the Labour Code (enterprise requirements), the Government transmits the enterprise s observations, which indicates that the dismissals were to adjust to business requirements. The enterprise recognizes that in , it reduced its staff from , to , direct employees, having paid the respective compensation to those dismissed, and that in the disputes arising from those dismissals, the courts had ruled in favour of the enterprise in some cases and in favour of the workers in others (no further details are provided regarding the court proceedings in question). The Government provides an information table regarding the handling of the complaints filed by the complainant organization, including references to two complaints for the indiscriminate or unjustified use of the provisions of article  of the Labour Code where it is indicated that no records had been found for their registration.
.As regards the allegations of non-compliance with the collective agreement, the information table provided by the Government regarding the handling of the complaints filed by the complainant organization refers to three complaints for non-compliance with the collective agreement and lists all the complaints that were investigated and which resulted in the issuance of fines.
.As to the allegation of the use of a bonus to encourage early, unregulated collective bargaining and to impede the exercise of the right to strike, the enterprise declares in its observations that the bonus had been paid since  and that it had been analysed by the enterprise and all of the workers' organizations, none of which had interpreted it as an attack on freedom of association, and that the enterprise had never prevented or impeded regulated collective bargaining. The Government indicates that: (i) the allegation was submitted to the courts, which ruled in January  that the enterprise had committed anti-union practices by making the payment of the bonus conditional on workers engaging in unregulated bargaining, ordered the enterprise to pay a fine of  monthly tax units and stated that the enterprise should restrict the payment of the bonus to objective circumstances relating to the performance of the enterprise, thereby excluding conditions relating to collective bargaining; and that (ii) the enterprise filed an appeal for annulment before the Antofagasta Court of Appeal, which was dismissed, followed by an appeal for the unification of judicial precedent before the Supreme Court, which was declared inadmissible. The Government concludes, therefore, that the court decision upheld the main complaint submitted by the complainant to the Committee and states that the decision ordering the enterprise to pay a fine was registered by the Labour Directorate and published in national journals.
.As regards the allegations of the constant questioning of trade union work and the exclusion of the complainant organization from discussions relating to the adoption of measures affecting all workers, the Committee notes that, in general, the enterprise indicates that its matrix structure enables constant interaction between the enterprise and its workers and their representatives, and that it applies an  open door' policy equally to everyone. As for the establishment of the bonus, the enterprise indicates that it was analysed in detail and without discrimination by the enterprise and all of the trade unions and federations, including the complainant organization. As to the allegation of constant efforts by a supervisor to discredit workers, setting their managers against them, the Government indicates that the competent authority invited the union officials to a meeting on  March  and that, in the meeting that they held with the lawyer handling the case, they indicated that the document containing said allegation should be taken as a statement rather than as a complaint.
.The Government ends by highlighting that, as is apparent from the information supplied and the actions taken, the acts reported by the complainant organization were penalized by the labour inspectorate and the competent courts.
.The Committee observes that the complaint concerns allegations of restrictions on the access of the President of the complainant organization to workplaces, unilateral reductions and discrimination in relation to union leave, non-compliance with collective agreements, anti union dismissals, exclusion and questioning of trade union work and the use of a bonus to promote early, unregulated collective bargaining and to impede the exercise of the right to strike.
.As regards the allegation that the president of the complainant organization was denied access to the mining sites of the SQM enterprise, the Committee observes that the complainant organization provides no further information in this regard and that neither the Government nor the enterprise have responded. The Committee can only observe that, under the mediation agreement of  April , signed by the enterprise and the president of the complainant organization, it was agreed that the enterprise would assign him his agreed work, and provide the means to enable him to carry out his professional activities (without specifically addressing the allegation of the denial of access to the various mining sites in his capacity as trade union leader). The Committee wishes to recall the principle by which  workers' representatives should be granted access to all workplaces in the undertaking where such access is necessary to enable them to carry out their representation function' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee of Freedom of Association, fifth",2,2013,Chile
42,"(revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide additional information to the Government concerning this allegation, so as to enable the Government to investigate should the concern persist. The Committee further invites the Government to obtain information in this respect from the enterprise through the employers' organization concerned, and requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.
.As regards the allegation of unilateral and discriminatory change in the practice of granting of union leave, the Committee notes that, according to the information provided by the Government, the parties decided under court conciliation procedures and mediation that union leave would only be used in accordance with the provisions set out in the Labour Code, without prejudice to provisions on union leave in collective agreements; that union leave taken until that date exceeding statutory leave would not be considered as unjustified absences, and would not result in sanctions or affect payment of wages, and that full effect would be given to communications sent by the enterprise regarding the use of union leave.
.As to the allegations of many dismissals of union members and officials on account of their union membership and participation in union activities, through indiscriminate reliance on enterprise requirements, and which, according to the complainant organization, have resulted in a considerable reduction in its membership, the Committee notes the enterprise s explanation that the dismissals were to adjust to business requirements and that the disputes arising from them had gone before the courts, which had found in favour of the enterprise in some cases and in favour of the workers in others. The Committee regrets that, despite the gravity of the allegations, beyond providing the observations made by the enterprise, the Government has not provided further information on these allegations, or on the proceedings before the competent authorities in this regard, only indicating that no records had been found for the registration of two complaints. Furthermore, the Committee wishes to recall the principle that the  application of staff reduction programmes must not be used to carry out acts of anti-union discrimination' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information regarding the handling of these allegations, including any relevant administrative or court decisions, expecting that, if acts of anti-union discrimination have been committed, adequate compensatory measures and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions are imposed. The Committee invites the complainant organization to provide any additional information that it may have in connection with these proceedings, including any legal action taken in that regard.
.As to the allegations of non-compliance with the collective agreement, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that inquiries have been carried out into the three complaints filed and that they all resulted in the issuance of fines. The Committee expects that the collective agreement is now being fully respected.
.With regard to the allegations that a bonus was used to encourage early, unregulated collective bargaining and to impede the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee notes that a court ruling of January  found that the enterprise had committed anti-union practices by making the payment of the bonus conditional on workers engaging in unregulated bargaining, ordered the enterprise to pay a fine of  monthly tax units (equivalent to approximately US$,), and stated that the payment of the bonus should be restricted to objective circumstances relating to the performance of the enterprise, thereby excluding conditions relating to collective bargaining. The Committee has not received any information from the complainant to indicate that the court ruling has not been fully applied.
.Concerning the general allegations that the enterprise constantly questions trade union work and excludes the complainant organization, the Committee observes that they are at odds with the observations made by the enterprise, which claims that it is in constant interaction with workers and their representatives, and that it applies an  open door' policy equally to everyone. The Committee further observes from the Government s indications that many of the acts reported by the complainant were penalized by the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Antofagasta and by the competent courts, and invites the Government to take the necessary initiatives to enhance dialogue between the enterprise and the complainant organization, with a view to preventing similar disputes in the future and promoting the exercise of freedom of association, and to keep it informed in that regard.
.As regards the allegation of constant efforts by a supervisor to discredit workers, setting their managers against them, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the union officials have indicated that the communication containing that allegation should be considered as a statement rather than as a complaint. In the absence of further information or evidence, unless the complainant organization provides sufficient additional information reaffirming and substantiating this allegation, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the complainant organization to provide additional information to the Government concerning the allegation that its president has been denied access to the mining sites of the enterprise, so as to enable the Government to investigate should this concern persist. The Committee also invites the Government to obtain information in this respect from the enterprise through the employers' organization concerned, and requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(b)	While acknowledging the efforts made by the competent authorities to resolve the issues relating to trade union leave, the Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information regarding the handling of the allegations of anti-union dismissals through indiscriminate reliance on the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, including any relevant administrative or court decisions, expecting that, if acts of anti-union discrimination have been committed, adequate compensatory measures and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions are imposed. The Committee invites the complainant organization to provide any additional information that it may have in connection with these proceedings, in particular any legal action taken in that regard.(c)	The Committee invites the Government to take the necessary initiatives to enhance dialogue between the enterprise and the complainant organization, with a view to preventing similar disputes in the future and promoting the exercise of freedom of association, and to keep it informed in that regard.",2,2013,Chile
43,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Specialized Maritime Port Employees (SEMPE) of October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication of October , SEMPE, which represents workers of the El Espign port terminal in San Antonio, explains at length the various stages in the modernization of the port sector since Act No.  of . It alleges that that process resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs; decisions which seriously prejudiced and discriminated against the El Espign port terminal compared with other terminals; acts or omissions on the part of the authorities to the benefit of other trade unions; and practices of the federation to which SEMPE was affiliated (but broke away from) and other trade union federations, to the detriment of SEMPE, which ultimately splintered and a breakaway union was created, in the context of conflicts of interests and disputes among trade union organizations.
.More specifically, the complaint concerns the process of determining the conditions governing the second bidding process and how the public port enterprise will handle the workers' proposals and establish the conditions for future port work, which under a  Order of the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare must be conducted  together with the workers'  Therefore, in June , the complainant requested the Board of Directors of the San Antonio Port Enterprise (EPSA) to include it in the initial phase of the negotiation process, and the enterprise informed the complainant that it would be included in the bargaining panel alongside the other trade unions which were represented by their respective federations. The negotiations broke down and a -day strike was called. On  January , the federations signed an agreement with the trade union federations operating in the El Espign port terminal to secure compensation for the portworkers who would be affected by the imminent bidding process, subject to conditions of age, accredited years of service in port work, inclusion on the list approved by the Maritime Authority in the period from  to , and place of work, it being understood that a distinction would be made between the workers from the San Antonio International Terminal (STI) and workers from the El Espign port terminal. Furthermore, two unions would be protected ' including the San Antonio Union of Customs Clerks (aforistas), whose members are contracted by customs agencies for cargo handling for containers, that is, to support the customs work itself ' who are not portworkers pursuant to Labour Directorate Order No. /. SEMPSAI, the splinter union from SEMPE also benefited.
.SEMPE adds that, after  months had elapsed since its June  request to the EPSA operations manager, and owing to the union s repeated attempts to have its officials participate in the negotiation panel, in late December  it called an extraordinary assembly to inform its members of the union s situation and EPSA s indifference towards its requests. Finally, SEMPE decided that its members would each manage their own application for benefits resulting from the bidding process for the state terminal. However, in January , the EPSA operations manager informed SEMPE, on behalf of EPSA s officials, that only workers belonging to the Alliance of Port Workers' Federations (FTP) could apply for the benefits obtained by the federations. Consequently, SEMPE members were excluded from the payment of compensation due to the fact that SEMPE did not belong to that alliance.
.SEMPE also alleges that the EPSA operations manager incited various SEMPE members to resign from the union as a prerequisite to receiving application forms for compensation. Those concerned finally gave up their membership as they were in need of the benefits. In addition, other members silently left the union (for example, one former SEMPE member submitted a voluntary statement and resignation letter, which was received by EPSA). However, the members who resigned from the union expecting to receive compensation were not considered by EPSA.
.On  March , the SEMPE secretary, Eduardo Rojas Muoz, met the EPSA operations manager and explained the situation of the trade union organization. At the end of the meeting, the operations manager made offers which were not specific. On the contrary, they did not include guarantees that SEMPE members would be able to receive the compensation payments that were guaranteed to other trade union organizations, thereby demonstrating favouritism towards the other unions mentioned above. Since the representative of the enterprise did not offer any guarantees, on  March , SEMPE replied to him by email, insisting that the union and EPSA reach a formal agreement ensuring that SEMPE members would receive the benefits.
.In June , the enterprise informed SEMPE that the EPSA Board had decided to extend the protocol agreement to include all portworkers, whether unionized or not, under the same conditions that applied to workers who were members of the signatory federations. In so doing, the EPSA general manager, together with the operations manager, made a verbal commitment that they would be considered as exceptions in the process.
.SEMPE adds that the application forms were submitted to the state enterprise within the prescribed time limits, on the understanding that, according to EPSA s verbal commitments, SEMPE members would benefit from the extension of the agreement; in particular, clause  provided that workers to whom the agreement applied on an exceptional basis would  have the status of selected workers and receive the benefit set out in clause , on the condition that they provided evidence to EPSA that they fulfilled the requirements of clause (e) and (f) above' 
.The complainant emphasizes that, in the application of the general terms of the agreement to its members, only three members were able to provide evidence of fulfilling all of the general requirements set out in the protocol agreements, as a result of their having taken work in other port enterprises to support themselves, and that the specific circumstances of the majority of SEMPE members that made them eligible to be considered as exceptions alongside SEMPSAI and the Union of Customs Clerks were not taken into account.
.This arbitrary decision, which excluded SEMPE members from the process, was challenged in a document dated  October  that was submitted to the President of the Board of the state enterprise, Patricio Arrau Pons; however, the Board never provided a response.
.Finally, in November , EPSA proceeded to pay out the compensation, excluding SEMPE s members once and for all since, according to EPSA, they did not meet the requirements, which were imposed arbitrarily.
.In view of such blatant arbitrary discrimination, SEMPE appealed to various parliamentary and ministerial authorities.
.The Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications responded on  December , stating that in accordance with section  of Act No. , it is for the port enterprises' directors to manage the processes for the concession of the docks and hence the resulting compensatory measures, for which they were granted absolute autonomy under the law. It was  not for the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications to participate' in determining such measures.
.The Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications subsequently confirmed that EPSA was autonomous in the bidding processes (given that the matter in question was the compensation process), thereby avoiding responsibility to exercise its powers of monitoring and supervising the actions of EPSA, an enterprise which is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications.
.In response, union leader Eduardo Rojas Muoz began a hunger strike on  January  in protest against the anti-union practices and breaches of labour rights by EPSA and the State of Chile, and seeking payment of compensation for the years he had worked at the State port terminal of San Antonio. The hunger strike lasted  days and had a serious impact on his health, seriously endangering his life. Throughout the strike, the government authorities took various steps with a view to resolving the dispute; however, the argument that EPSA was an autonomous enterprise always prevailed.
.The Ministry of Labour stated that by law it is the Office of the Comptroller-General which is responsible for interpreting the Labour Code, ensuring that it is applied correctly and exercising supervisory control over public or state enterprises, and accordingly is the competent authority to rule on the illegalities at the root of the dispute.
.Decision No.  of the Office of the Comptroller-General was issued on  March  and addressed only the terms of the protocol agreement and the application forms received by EPSA, making no reference to the state enterprise s failure to negotiate with the union, the arbitrary application of the terms of the agreement to SEMPE s members or EPSA s anti-union practices. In other words, the Office of the Comptroller-General considered only EPSA s arguments and made no finding on the arguments presented by",0,2012,Chile
44,"the trade union.
.In light of the foregoing, SEMPE requests that the violations of its members' labour and union rights and the discrimination they suffered be remedied and that its members be awarded compensation forthwith.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government refers to the complaint of SEMPE and states that it has sought the opinion of EPSA and, on the basis of its response, makes the following observations: the SEMPE trade union relies on Act No.  of  governing the modernization of the state port sector. It explains how the actions of EPSA resulted in the dock that it was operating (El Espign) becoming less competitive than the Molo South Terminal (STI). Moreover, it refers to the facts which, in its view, led to SEMPE s split from the Federation of Temporary Contractors and Allied Workers in Maritime Ports (FETRAMPEC), which did receive compensation from EPSA. It then describes the compensation process put in place by EPSA and refers to the judicial and administrative proceedings which were initiated when the union was not awarded compensatory measures and the disputes with other unions.
.EPSA states that in the exercise of its legal functions, its Board launched a public bidding process for the concession of the Costanera Espign dock of the San Antonio port. The concession was awarded to Puerto Lirqun SA and transferred to the operator that was established for the purpose, called Puerto Central SA, on  November .
.The enterprise notes that the concession for the dock was awarded under the port operation system known as the  single-operator system'  which replaced the  multi-operator system'  This situation led to a change in demand for port work and the wharf enterprises located in El Espign ceased to operate as a result.
.EPSA states that, even though no portworkers have a subordinate or dependent relationship with EPSA, but instead work for the enterprises responsible for moving and transferring cargo, the EPSA Board considered it appropriate to establish a compensation scheme to ensure that the bidding process could be completed without any social or labour-related impediments.
.Accordingly, and after conducting the corresponding consultations, the Office of the Comptroller-General issued Decision No.  of  June , ruling that as part of the terms of the bidding process, EPSA had the authority to establish a sum to fund a compensation scheme for the portworkers whose source of work would be affected by the change from the multi-operator to the single-operator system.
.In the light of the above, under the heading  Provision of funds'  section .. of the relevant terms of the bidding process placed an obligation on the successful bidder to earmark funds amounting to a maximum of US$,, to cover such compensation schemes.
.Under these circumstances, and after an arduous negotiation process that included a prolonged standstill, on  and  January , EPSA signed two protocol agreements with the six workers' federations in the sector providing for the establishment of a compensation scheme for those portworkers who fulfilled certain requirements pertaining to age, years of service in the port sector and place of work, to be borne by the successful bidder.
.Furthermore, the enterprise s Board considered it appropriate to extend the benefits provided for in the protocols to include non-unionized workers who both met the age requirement and performed work comparable to that of the workers covered by the agreements.
.In order to be eligible for the compensation scheme, portworkers (whether unionized or not) had to fulfil the following cumulative requirements:(a) have been portworkers in the years , ,  and until September , as demonstrated by the corresponding red card for each of those years;(b) have been included on the payroll or classified as  designated' workers approved by the harbour master s office of the San Antonio port in the years , ,  and until September  or, alternatively, provide evidence of their income from the port precinct by means of a valid contract and social security contributions for such periods;(c) have worked  or more shifts in each of the years ,  and , and  or more shifts until September , in port enterprises operating during those periods in the San Antonio port;(d) have possessed a valid portworker s card issued by the maritime authority of Chile (DIRECTEMAR) since  December  and until the time of applying for and receiving the benefit;(e) not have received previous compensation from the State as a former worker of the former port enterprise of Chile or as a result of previous port terminal concession processes or the restructuring or modernization of the state port sector.
.The following forms of proof were established:(a) years of service in the system: statements of contributions from the Social Security Institute (IPS) or the Pension Fund Administration (AFP);(b) minimum number of shifts: workers  designated' by the Maritime Authority;(c) proof of employment as a portworker: red card, valid until  and accredited for each of the years , ,  and ;(d) employment in a port enterprise: certified by the Maritime Authority.
.Both the relevant protocols and the beneficiaries of the compensation scheme were published clearly and transparently on the EPSA website, and the workers who were on the relevant lists were invited to contact the enterprise s offices to resolve any doubts.
.A total of , applications from workers seeking to be included in the compensation scheme were received. The data underwent an exhaustive checking and auditing process, which produced a final list of , workers; only  applications, or . per cent of the total, were rejected.
.Finally, by letter No.  dated  October  EPSA sent the successful bidder, Puerto Central SA, the relevant instructions to pay the selected workers compensation totalling ,,, pesos. The subsequent payment process ran smoothly.
.In the case of SEMPE, considering that it did not belong to any of the six signatory federations, some months after the protocol agreements had been signed, its union officials met EPSA executives to request negotiations in parallel to the ongoing negotiations, under conditions differing from those agreed. Considering the request to be out of time and invalid, EPSA informed the union that that would not be possible, but that the Board of the enterprise had decided to extend the benefits of the agreements to other portworkers who fulfilled the same requirements, as stated above. It was then invited to submit applications for its members. Having accepted the invitation, in a letter to EPSA dated  August , the President of SEMPE provided a list of nine of its members. The outcome of the subsequent examination of their applications is set out in the following table.ShiftsNameOutcome of applicationFunzalida Hernndez, Luis AndrsDoes not meet required No. of shiftsGonzlez Gaete, Juan CarlosMeets requirements.

Received ,, pesos>
.As can be seen, three of the nine workers met the requirements and received compensation payments. Since the remaining workers had not worked the minimum number of shifts, their applications were rejected and they were informed by a letter to their home addresses. Despite the fact that the enterprise provided objective reasons why three applications were granted and the remaining six were rejected, the President of SEMPE, Alejandro Rojas Muoz, began a hunger strike that lasted more than two months. However, his state of health remained unchanged, as certified by the Director of the San Antonio hospital.
.Moreover, he submitted a complaint on the matter to the Office of the Comptroller-General, which rejected the complaint by Decision No.  of  March , finding that:' there are no objections to be made as to the lawfulness of the objective and generally applicable criteria considered by the San Antonio Port Enterprise in order to define the form, timing and beneficiaries of the resources that the successful bidder provided in accordance with the terms of the bidding process to fund the payments in question and, consequently, to deny payment to persons failing to meet the criteria.
.In its complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association, SEMPE alleges that EPSA refused to meet SEMPE officials, took steps designed to weaken the union by requiring workers to give up their membership in order to receive compensation, and refused to negotiate the terms under which compensation would be awarded.
.In this regard, EPSA notes that neither SEMPE nor its members have any contractual relationship with EPSA. Furthermore, it bears repeating that EPSA began the negotiation process voluntarily, despite being under no obligation to do so. That being said, representatives of EPSA met SEMPE officials on many occasions and responded to their claims. Under no circumstances were workers required to give up their union membership in order to obtain a compensation payout, as was claimed. On",-1,2012,Chile
45,"the contrary, in order to demonstrate respect for freedom of association, the EPSA Board extended the benefits of the protocol agreements signed with the six federations of portworkers in San Antonio to include all workers, whether unionized or not, who fulfilled the requirements. Consequently, since there was no requirement for workers to be unionized or to be a member of a particular organization, SEMPE s claim that its members were required to give up their union membership in order to submit an application is unfounded. The enterprise considers such an assertion to be very serious and wholly untrue and unjustified.
.Moreover, the enterprise fails to understand why SEMPE considers that it should have been treated differently from the other first-level unions in the sector that an exclusive, parallel negotiation process should have been undertaken. The negotiation process included all of the workers' federations in the sector, thereby covering the vast majority of trade unions since, contrary to SEMPE s claims, it was not practical or possible to negotiate with each of the first-level unions in the sector.
.As to the complaints of anti-union practices and the call to pay compensation, the enterprise notes, firstly, that there were no possible anti-union practices, as EPSA has no contractual relationship of any kind with SEMPE, and SEMPE members were not treated arbitrarily, since the agreements were applied objectively to the applications submitted by the nine SEMPE members.
.The enterprise emphasizes that the administrative proceedings were concluded when it sent the successful bidder, Puerto Central SA, a communication setting out the relevant instructions for the payment of the compensation. The payment process ran smoothly. It is therefore not possible to conduct a new payment process, since EPSA has neither the resources nor the contractual basis to make such a request of Puerto Central SA.
.The Government considers that the comments submitted by EPSA speak for themselves, and only require certain clarifications, which further undermine SEMPE s position.
.The trade union claims to have appealed to both the ordinary courts (labour tribunals, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court) and the Office of the Comptroller-General, none of which found in its favour, which is why it submitted the present complaint.
.As a result, it is rather difficult to argue that the State of Chile has failed to comply with ILO Conventions, considering that only six persons of a total of nine did not receive compensation payments made voluntarily by a state enterprise.
.In conclusion, in the light of all of these additional clarifications and considering the information provided by EPSA, the Government rejects and considers unfounded SEMPE s claims of violations of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that in this case, which concerns facts dating from , the complainant alleges that EPSA excluded it from the collective bargaining process relating to the compensation for portworkers that was decided following the bidding process for the El Espign terminal port in San Antonio, and that only three of its members were eligible for the said benefits, in particular the compensation payments. The complainant also makes allegations of anti-union practices consisting of pressure on members to leave the union as a condition for receiving the document and data required to apply for compensation.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the authorities failed to fulfil their oversight function and the enterprise refused to recognize verbal commitments from the management that clause  of the collective agreement signed with the six federations with respect to the workers covered by the said collective agreement would apply to the union s members on an exceptional basis; however, other workers who did not meet the minimum requirements for the payouts and who were members of two different unions were granted compensation. The Committee observes that, according to the complaint and the information provided by the Government, the administrative decisions and court rulings on the complainant s appeals did not find in the union s favour.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union practices and the complainant s alleged exclusion from the collective bargaining process concerning training and compensation as a result of the concession for the El Espign port in San Antonio being awarded to a single enterprise, during which the criteria were set for determining the benefits of the legal compensation resulting from different enterprises ceasing to operate in the port, the Committee notes the information from EPSA provided by the Government, according to which: () the criteria for compensation were set out in an agreement with six federations in the sector and require certain conditions (for example, recipients must not have previously received compensation arising from restructuring processes); () as a result of conversations with the complainant, the benefits of the compensation were extended to include all workers meeting the requirements, regardless of whether or not they were members of the signatory trade unions ' a situation which precluded any discrimination against or pressure to leave a union, and in no case did the enterprise require anyone to give up their union membership; () the enterprise met with officials of the complainant trade union on many occasions and its claims were responded to through negotiations with all of the federations in the sector, as it was neither possible nor practical to negotiate with each union separately; () compensation was paid to three members of the complainant organization who fulfilled the requirements agreed with the federations, but not to the six other workers who did not meet the requirements.
.The Committee considers that it cannot criticize the fact that the authorities and the enterprise negotiated the compensatory measures with the federations of portworkers, excluding the complainant trade union, as the problems raised concerned the entire port sector; nor can it find fault with the enterprise for not including the complainant in the bargaining panel. Moreover, the Committee notes a discrepancy between the versions of the complainant and the enterprise concerning alleged anti-union practices (pressure to give up union membership as a prerequisite for receiving the application form for compensation and refusal to meet with union officials), but observes that both the complainant and the Government agree that the enterprise ultimately extended the possibility to receive the negotiated compensation to all portworkers, whether unionized or not, meaning that the potential beneficiaries also included those members of the complainant trade union who fulfilled the negotiated requirements.
.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant union, only three of its members received compensation, and that the enterprise states that the remaining six members did not fulfil the negotiated requirements concerning the number of shifts and did not receive compensation for that reason. The Committee notes that the complainant argues that the enterprise made verbal commitments that those workers would be considered under clause  of the agreement reached with the federations concerning the workers to whom the agreement would apply on an exceptional basis, and that the enterprise awarded compensation to workers of two trade unions who did not fulfil the requirements. The Committee observes that the parties differ in their interpretation of whether the agreement reached, and in particular clause , applies to the members of the complainant union and whether the members fulfil the requirements set out in the collective agreement to be eligible for compensation. The Committee recalls that  the solution to a legal conflict as a result of a difference in interpretation of a legal text should be left to the competent courts' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee observes in this regard that the legal action and this appeals made by the complainant with a view to obtaining payment of compensation for all of its members did not succeed and that those decisions confirm the legality of the criteria negotiated with the trade union federations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2012,Chile
46,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  November  presented by the National Federation of University Professionals in the Health Services (FENPRUSS).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , FENPRUSS alleges that various national health service departments have adopted anti-union practices against the officials of the FENPRUSS Association of Public Servants. Those anti-union practices include lowering the wages of union officials. In particular, the complainant alleges that La Serena Hospital lowered the wages of the union official Ms Dina Imaa Choque by approximately , Chilean pesos (CLP) for having made use of her union leave and failing to work the hospital shifts that had been assigned to her. The complainant also alleges that the San Carlos de Concepcin Hospital changed the working hours of the official Mr Leoncio Zarate Acua and that, as a result of that change, the official stopped being assigned shifts and suffered a pay cut. According to the complainant, the immunity of union officials should necessarily extend to their wages.
.Another of the anti-union practices alleged by the complainant concerns changes to the duties of trade union officials. In particular, the complainant alleges that: () in making use of its management and coordination rights, the Via del Mar-Quillota Health Services arbitrarily transferred the union official, Mr Jos Salomn Silva, to the recently created Pre Investment Studies and Projects Department of the Petorca Hospital; () the Concepcin Health Services abruptly, and for no reason, removed the architect and union official, Mr Johnny Villouta, from his leadership role in the technical inspection of various projects, thereby exposing the community and the health services to fines and accidents; () the union official Ms Karem Egle Kruberg, who works for the Valparaso Health Services, was put under pressure by the former director of the department, Mr Vctor Ayala, to carry out bidding processes which violated the legal regulations on procurement procedures; and () lastly, a reorganization in the Quelln Hospital resulted in the transfer of the union official Mr Octavio Fernando Soto Leal, from the maternity department, where he worked shifts as a senior nurse, to the hospital clinic, resulting in a pay cut and constituting a clear violation of trade union immunity.
.The complainant also alleges that the Lebu hospital management refused to grant the request made by the union official Ms Andrea Osorio Pena for  hours' union leave and filed administrative proceedings against her for unjustified absences. The complainant organization insists that section  of Act No. , of , establishes a minimum number of hours' leave to which the directors of associations are entitled, without however establishing a maximum limit, which means that it can be argued that there is no legal impediment to granting leave exceeding the minimum number of hours.
.The complainant also alleges that union officials have been restricted in their right to make claims. It reports that a group of union officials of the Via del Mar-Quillota Health Services publicly had requested to meet the health service authorities and that, after their request was rejected, they held a peaceful sit-in inside the health service premises, at which the hospital instituted criminal proceedings against various union officials for  encroachment on state property'  The complainant insists that their presence in the offices of the health service directorate was peaceful, that they did not obstruct workers' movements, and that they only requested to meet with the authorities.
.Another anti-union practice reported by the complainant relates to reprisals taken against a union official at the end of her contract. In particular, the complainant organization alleges that the Flix Bulnes Hospital terminated the contract of Ms Sheila Mena Zumarn, who was employed as a medical technician, immediately after the expiry of her trade union immunity. The complainant indicates that she was notified of the termination on  June , without being given a reason.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges anti-union harassment against union leaders. In particular, the complainant indicates that the Minister of Health initiated legal proceedings against Ms Gabriela Faras, the current President of FENPRUSS, for putting herself forward as an alternative minister in her trade union capacity. FENPRUSS reports that the proceedings were dismissed.
.In conclusion, FENPRUSS indicates that neither Act No. , regulating associations of public sector employees, nor Act No. , establishing the Administrative Statute, provide sanctions for those who adopt anti-union practices, thereby allowing total impunity. Accordingly, FENPRUSS considers that the legislation has not been brought into line with the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.In its communication dated  January , the Government transmits the comments made by the health services concerned and by the Ministry of Health regarding the allegations made by FENPRUSS and it denies that any anti-union practices have been adopted against the leaders of the FENPRUSS Association of Public Servants.
.As regards the allegation that the union official Ms Dina Imaa Choque suffered a pay cut of approximately CLP, for having made use of her union leave, and for failing to work the hospital shifts that had been assigned to her, the management of La Serena Hospital and the Coquimbo Health Services explain that the decision to lower the worker s wages by that amount followed an express order from the Office of the Regional Comptroller of Coquimbo. For its part, the Government explains that the health services and the hospital network are part of the Chilean public sector, and that they are therefore subject to the authority of the Office of the Comptroller-General, which is a constitutional body. The Government indicates that the Office of the Regional Comptroller of Coquimbo issued a report in  in which it indicated that  public servants registered on a shift rota who are union officials and who, in that capacity, do not perform their duties, are only entitled to receive payment for an ordinary working day, but not the compensation paid for the performance of duties during extraordinary or special hours, since this payment requires the effective performance of such work'  The Government indicates that the Ministry of Health has held meetings with the Office of the Comptroller-General and with the Budget Directorate of the Ministry of Finance to streamline the requirements of the Office of the Comptroller-General with regard to the assignment of shifts and to facilitate the exercise of union duties alongside the effective performance of the professional services required in the area of public health. Lastly, the Government indicates that Ms Imaa initiated court proceedings against the Coquimbo Health Services, but then withdrew her complaint, and that the proceedings have now concluded without any decision as to the substance of the matter.
.As regards the allegation that the change in the working hours of the union official Mr Leoncio Zrate Acua at the San Carlos de Concepcin Hospital meant that he stopped being assigned to shifts, which resulted in a pay cut, the Ministry of Health indicates that in  Mr Zrate Acua joined the shift system and that he has since been working on daytime shifts. The Ministry also indicates that in August  a new FENPRUSS executive committee was set up in that establishment and that Mr Zrate Acua was not re elected to the position which he formerly held, thereby losing his status as a union official.
.As regards the transfer of the union official, Mr Jos Salomn Silva, to the new Pre Investment Studies and Projects Department of the Petorca Hospital, the Via del Mar Quillota Health Services report that although the transfer was carried out in accordance with the Administrative Statute, the Supreme Court of Justice upheld an appeal for protection filed by Mr Salomn against the transfer and ordered its suspension. The Government reports that the health services complied with the order and that Mr Salomn is now working at the San Martin de Quillota Hospital.
.As regards the alleged administrative irregularity brought about by the director of the Concepcin Health Services when he reassigned the architect and union official Mr Johnny Villouta to other department projects, the head of the Concepcin Health Services explains that the reassignment of projects occurred during an internal restructuring and that it also took into account certain problems that had arisen in the project for which the architect was the technical inspector and project manager. The head of the Concepcin Health Services insists that the architect was never assigned to duties that were not inherent to his profession and that he never stopped working in the commune of Concepcin. For its part, the Government indicates that the architect presented claims before the Bo Bo Regional Comptroller and filed an appeal for protection before the Court of Appeal of Concepcin in which he presented claims in this regard, but that to date none of these claims have been upheld.
.As regards the",0,2012,Chile
47,"allegation that the union official Ms Karem Egle Kruberg, who held the position of head of logistics in the Valparaiso Health Services, was put under pressure by the former director of the department, Mr Vctor Ayala, to carry out bidding processes violating the legal regulations on procurement procedures, the Ministry of Health reports that the accusations are being investigated and that Mr Vctor Ayala was relieved of his duties in December .
.As regards the transfer of the union official Mr Octavio Fernando Soto Leal, who stopped working shifts as a senior nurse in the maternity department and was moved to the hospital clinic, the Quelln Hospital reports that the director of the department decided to revoke the transfer and that Mr Soto returned to his normal duties.
.As regards the alleged refusal by the Lebu Hospital management to grant the request made by the union official Ms Andrea Osorio Pena for  hours' union leave, the Ministry of Health indicates that in no event has a request for union leave been rejected arbitrarily or without cause; the union official was able to justify her absences and she was able to take union leave over the period  to  April .
.As regards the allegation that a group of union officials in the Via del Mar-Quillota Health Services had publicly request to meet the health service authorities and that after their request was rejected they held a peaceful sit-in inside the health service premises, at which the hospital instituted criminal proceedings against various union officials for  encroachment on state property'  the Ministry of Health indicates that: () the occupation was not peaceful, that it prevented the entry of other employees working in those premises and that they closed the door and prevented normal access to the premises; () the hospital filed standard criminal proceedings in order to let the Public Prosecutor s Office decide whether a crime had been committed; and () notwithstanding the fact that the criminal proceedings were dismissed on the grounds that the events did not constitute a crime, this way of attempting to get the authorities' attention should be energetically rejected.
.As regards the allegation that the Flix Bulnes Hospital terminated the contract of Ms Sheila Mena Zumarn, employed as a medical technician, immediately after the expiry of her trade union immunity, the Ministry of Health reports that Ms Mena Zumarn s contract at that institution ran until  June  and that the termination operated in the due course of law. The Ministry of Health observes that the expiry of the period for which workers are employed results in the immediate termination of their duties.
.Lastly, regarding the allegation that the Minister of Health initiated legal proceedings against Ms Gabriela Faras, the current President of FENPRUSS, for putting herself forward as an alternative minister in her trade union capacity, the Ministry of Health reports that the proceedings against Ms Gabriela Faras have been dismissed by the courts, so that no disciplinary action has been taken against the union official.
.In view of the above, the Government denies that it has violated ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The Committee observes that this case concerns allegations that various national health service departments adopted anti-union practices against officials of the FENPRUSS Association of Public Servants, including pay cuts, changes in duties, restrictions on the use of union leave and on union officials' right to submit claims, reprisals against a union official at the end of her contract and harassment. The Committee observes that the Government s reply indicates that many of the problems have been resolved, as is evident in the following conclusions.
.As regards the allegation that the union official Ms Dina Imaa Choque suffered a pay cut of approximately CLP, for having made use of her union leave and for failing to work the hospital shifts that had been assigned to her, the Committee notes that the hospital management of the Serena Hospital and the Coquimbo Health Services explain that the decision to lower the worker s wages by that amount followed an express order from the Office of the Regional Comptroller of Coquimbo. The Government explains that the health services and the hospital network are part of the Chilean public sector and that they are therefore subject to the authority of the Office of the Comptroller-General. The Committee also notes that the Government indicates that Ms Imaa initiated court proceedings against the Coquimbo health services, but then withdrew her complaint, and that the proceedings have now concluded without any decision as to the substance of the matter.

The Committee notes this information with interest and firmly expects that the problems in question may be resolved as a result of these meetings.
.As regards the allegation that the change in the working hours of the union official Mr Leoncio Zrate Acua at the San Carlos de Concepcin Hospital meant that he stopped being assigned to shifts, which resulted in a pay cut, the Committee notes that the Ministry of Health indicates that, in , Mr Zrate Acua joined the shift system and that he has since been working on daytime shifts. The Committee also observes that the Government indicates that in August , a new FENPRUSS executive committee was set up in that health establishment and that Mr Zrate Acua was not re-elected to the position which he formerly held, thereby losing his status as a union official. The Committee takes due note of this information.
.As regards the transfer of the union official Mr Jos Salomn Silva to the new Pre Investment Studies and Projects Department of the Petorca Hospital, the Committee notes that the Via del Mar-Quillota Health Services report that, although the transfer was carried out in accordance with the Administrative Statute, the Supreme Court of Justice upheld an appeal for protection filed by Mr Salomn against the transfer and ordered its suspension. The Committee notes with interest that the health services complied with that order and that Mr Salomn is now working at the San Martin de Quillota Hospital.
.As regards the alleged administrative irregularity brought about by the director of the Concepcin Health Services when he reassigned the architect and union official Mr Johnny Villouta to other department projects, the Committee takes note of the explanation provided by the head of the Concepcin Health Services, who indicates that the reassignment of projects occurred during internal restructuring and that it also took into account certain problems that had arisen in the project for which the architect was the technical inspector and project manager. The Committee also takes note of the Government s indication that the architect was never assigned to duties that were not inherent to his profession and that he never stopped working in the commune of Concepcin. The Committee also notes that the Government indicates that the architect presented claims before the Bo Bo Regional Comptroller and filed an appeal for protection before the Court of Appeal of Concepcin in which he presented claims in this regard, but that to date none of these claims have been upheld. The Committee requests the Government, if the court appeal processes brought by Mr Johnny Villouta find that his reassignment to other projects constituted anti-union discrimination, to take the necessary steps to adequately remedy the situation.
.As regards the allegation that the union official Ms Karem Egle Kruberg (who held the position of head of logistics in the Valparaiso Health Services) was put under pressure by the former director of the department to carry out bidding processes which violate the regulations on procurement procedures, the Committee notes that the Ministry of Health reports that the accusations are being investigated and that the former director, referred to in the complaint, was relieved of his duties in December . The Committee takes note of this information.
.As regards the transfer of the union official Mr Octavio Fernando Soto Leal, who stopped working shifts as a senior nurse in the maternity department and was moved to the hospital clinic, the Committee notes with interest that the Quelln Hospital reports that the director of the department decided to revoke the transfer and that Mr Soto returned to his normal duties.
.As regards the alleged refusal by the management of the Lebu Hospital to grant the request made by the union official Ms Andrea Osorio Pena for  hours' union leave and the alleged administrative proceedings for unjustified absences, the Committee notes that the Ministry of Health indicates that in no event has a request for union leave been rejected arbitrarily or without cause, and that, in the aforementioned administrative proceedings, the union official was",-1,2012,Chile
48,"able to justify her absences and was able to take union leave over the period '  April . The Committee draws attention to the fact that initiating administrative proceedings without sufficient grounds might have an intimidating effect on union officials.
.As regards the allegation that a group of union officials in the Via del Mar-Quillota Health Services had publicly requested to meet the health service authorities and that after their request was rejected they held a peaceful sit-in inside the health service premises, at which the hospital instituted criminal proceedings against various union officials for  encroachment on state property'  the Committee notes that according to the Ministry of Health: () the occupation was not peaceful, it prevented the entry of other employees working in those premises and the doors were closed preventing normal access to the premises; () the hospital filed standard criminal proceedings in order to let the Public Prosecutor s Office decide whether a crime had been committed; and () notwithstanding the fact that the criminal proceedings were dismissed on the grounds that the events did not constitute a crime, this way of attempting to get the authorities' attention should be energetically rejected. The Committee takes note of this information, which indicates that there are currently no ongoing criminal proceedings against union members.
.As regards the allegation that the Flix Bulnes Hospital terminated the contract of Ms Sheila Mena Zumarn, employed as a medical technician, immediately after the expiry of her trade union immunity, the Committee notes that the Ministry of Health reports that Ms Mena Zumarn s contract at that institution ran until  June , and that the termination operated in the due course of law. The Committee notes that the Ministry of Health observes that the expiry of the period for which workers are employed results in the immediate termination of their duties. In the absence of any concrete information or proof indicating anti-union motives of the non-renewal of the contract of this official, the Committee does not consider that this matter calls for further examination.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation that the Minister of Health initiated legal proceedings against Ms Gabriela Faras, the current President of FENPRUSS, for having put herself forward as an alternative minister in her trade union capacity, the Committee notes that the Ministry of Health reports that the proceedings against Ms Gabriela Faras have been dismissed by the courts, so that no disciplinary action has been taken against the union official.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expects that if the court appeal processes lodged by the union official Mr Johnny Villouta due to his reassignment to new projects find anti-union discrimination, the Government will take the necessary steps to adequately remedy the situation.",1,2012,Chile
49,".The complaint is set out in a communication from the National Federation of the Unions of Supervisors, List A, and Professionals of the Enterprise CODELCO (FESUC), dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of August .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , FESUC reports that it has affiliated six unions and some , professionals working for the Enterprise CODELCO (hereinafter referred to as  the enterprise' . The union was established on  October  in the city of Chuquicamata by the supervisors' unions of the El Teniente, Andina, Salvador, Tocopilla and Chuquicamata divisions and by the central office. In its by-laws, FESUC states that its founding mission is to  uphold and develop the fundamental rights of workers, especially the freedom of association and collective bargaining enshrined in Conventions Nos  and  of the International Labour Organization' 
.FESUC notes that the approach to law in Chile is extremely legalistic and positivist, to the extent that what is not expressly regulated by ordinary law is considered to have no existence as a right, and, to the extent that it is not expressly authorized by law, it cannot be exercised. In its view this implies that the theory which suggests that ILO Conventions are only applicable in Chile to the extent that they are explicitly recognized by domestic law, rather than by being ratified and in force in this country, is often used to render null and void the content of such agreements. This means that, in practice, increasing currency is being given to a particular type of misunderstanding and a systematic violation of the ILO Conventions in force in Chile. Since the ratification by the Chilean Parliament in  and the adoption and entry into force in Chile of ILO Conventions Nos  and , together with the other ILO Conventions already ratified by Chile, the state authorities have not carried out the constitutional and legal reforms necessary to ensure and give effect to the principle of freedom of association and to the other principles enshrined in these Conventions. The National Congress has only revised certain regulations (by Law No. ), but has maintained others that run counter to international standards on freedom of association, rendering it impossible to implement the reforms in practice.
.FESUC claims that figures provided by the Department of Labour show that the historically low rate of unionization since  has not improved, and has even decreased. Currently there are unions at only . per cent of firms in Chile, with a membership rate of . per cent, and collective bargaining is marginal, covering a mere  per cent of male and female workers.
.FESUC alleges that the enterprise has violated and continues to violate the Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. It specifically cites the following violations:?Limitation of the right to collective bargaining, employing the arguments of article  of the Labour Code. FESUC alleges that, during the collective bargaining process undertaken by one of the unions affiliated to the Federation in , the enterprise invoked article  of the Labour Code to exclude from that collective bargaining all workers who had temporary contracts for work or services in the  Radomiro Tomic' organization and those serving as directors or superintendents in the  Ministro Hales' establishment. FESUC claims that the exclusion of CODELCO supervisors from collective bargaining constitutes an encroachment on the freedom of association of these workers; not only are they deprived of their fundamental right to collective bargaining, but the bargaining position of the supervisors' union is itself also weakened by the drop in numbers of members and the lack of potential growth in the section composed of senior professionals, as they are deprived of their legitimate right to collective representation.?Limitation of the right to organize and collective bargaining, citing the provisions of article  of the Labour Code which requires that non-union workers who enjoy the benefits stipulated in a collective instrument should pay  per cent of the ordinary monthly union dues. FESUC points out that, whenever a supervisors' union negotiates collectively, the enterprise extends to non-union workers all the benefits secured by the union. FESUC notes that the collective bargaining process and most of the activities involving worker representation must be financed by union dues (ordinary and extraordinary), which are also used for the commissioning of studies, consultancies and other activities that are part of that process, such as work meetings, assemblies and communications with its workers and affiliated workers. At the same time, union workers must use their own time and resources to attend meetings, study the proposals and counter-proposals and, if necessary, carry out the strike, during which the worker receives no remuneration. Non-union workers reap the benefits of the efforts, sacrifice, expenditure and investments made by both the union and the union workers, but without contributing any funding or investment of their own, or taking part in any strike action. Thanks, however, to the existence of article  of the Labour Code and its observation by the employer, they receive the full set of benefits achieved by the union through collective bargaining, while only being required to pay  per cent of the ordinary union dues.?In the enterprise there are about , supervisors, some , of whom are unionized. Thus, in practice, the , enterprise supervisors receive benefits equivalent to those gained by the unions affiliated to FESUC in each division, but the aforementioned costs and negotiation efforts fall exclusively on the shoulders of the , union workers represented in their trade union organizations. In consequence, the nearly , non-union supervisors, in keeping with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, have no real incentive to join the union, because under this rule they enjoy the same benefits as union workers, but at a much lower cost than that borne by the union workers.?Limitation of the right to strike, pursuant to article  and other provisions of the Labour Code. In , the Federation of Copper Workers (FTC) called for a complete stoppage of all work in the enterprise, to take place on  July . Accordingly, almost all the enterprise s unions, including those affiliated to FESUC, went on strike against the state enterprise s policy to impose its transformation plans, and the fact that many of the measures taken not only created precarious working conditions for staff but were designed to move the enterprise in the direction of privatization. This strike did not fall within the collective bargaining process described in Chilean law. The enterprise maintained and continues to maintain that the stoppage was illegal and threatened to fire workers who took part, calling into question the right of workers to carry out a legal strike outside the collective bargaining process.
.In its communication of August , the Government states that the enterprise had highlighted the existence of the rule of law, a judiciary, and legal, political and administrative institutions which fully safeguarded the individual and collective rights of citizens. The enterprise adds that, before filing the present complaint, FESUC had taken no action through the appropriate bodies provided for by Chilean legislation. The enterprise reports that, in December , it had a workforce of , of its own workers and , workers subcontracted from other firms, supporting its operations and services, in addition to , workers from contracting companies associated with the enterprise s construction or investment projects. The enterprise states that there are  unions with an overall membership of ,, a figure that represents . per cent of its total workforce. Where List A supervisors are concerned, the enterprise notes that there are seven unions, all affiliated to FESUC, with , members, equivalent to . per cent of the total number of List A supervisors. The enterprise adds that, owing to the depletion of its productive resources, it had come up with a new business strategy referred to as  structural projects'  This strategy has led to the adoption of decisions that will create the appropriate organizational conditions to ensure the efficient implementation of these structural projects.
.The enterprise maintains that all wages and working conditions set out in the contracts and collective agreements are the result of free and voluntary collective bargaining and that these contracts or collective agreements, in addition to having been freely agreed with the trade unions, contain no discriminatory clauses. In the collective bargaining process within the enterprise, trade unions exercise a constitutional right under which they agree on conditions of employment and collective instruments. These offer benefits far superior to those contained in other contracts or collective agreements concluded in Chile. It is recognized that workers have the right to take action, including strike action.
.For its part the Government states that, in the case in question, FESUC had exercised its right of recourse to the ILO, but without having exhausted",0,2012,Chile
50,"the remedies available at the national level. The Government believes that it would be difficult to bring a case at international level if there had not even been any opportunity for discussion at domestic level. In the Government s view, it should be stressed that certain provisions of the Political Constitution relating to the fundamental rights of individuals, the mechanisms for upholding those rights, the functions of the state authorities and agencies responsible for monitoring the legality of certain administrative acts and laws demonstrate that the country has a democratic system subject to effective checks and balances. This system enables, at different levels and using different legal and policy tools, the implementation of measures designed to improve the democratic system itself, through the principles, institutions and processes set out in the Constitution and the law. Lastly, the Government states that, on the basis of the information provided and the statements made by the enterprise, it dismisses the complaint and refutes as unfounded the complaint by FESUC alleging violations of Conventions Nos  and .
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that the enterprise CODELCO: () invoking the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, has excluded workers with temporary contracts for work or services in the organization  Radomiro Tomic' from the collective bargaining process, and also excludes those serving as directors or superintendents in the establishment  Ministro Hales'  () by applying article  of the Labour Code, which requires non-union workers who are the recipients of benefits under a collective instrument to pay  per cent of the regular monthly union dues, is discouraging individuals from exercising their right to organize; and () in accordance with articles  et seq. of the Labour Code outlawed a work stoppage against the policy that the state enterprise was applying, with a view to pushing through its transformation plans, because they were being developed outside the collective bargaining process.
.With regard to the alleged exclusion from collective bargaining of workers with temporary contracts for work or services in the  Radomiro Tomic' establishment and of those serving as directors or superintendents in the  Ministro Hales' establishment, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the enterprise has stated the following: () there are  unions with , members, representing . per cent of the total workforce; () where the List A supervisors are concerned, the enterprise has stated that there are seven unions, all affiliated to FESUC, comprising , members, equivalent to . per cent of the overall number of List A supervisors; () in the light of the depletion of productive resources, a new business strategy has been formed, known as  structural projects'  and this strategy has resulted in decisions setting in place organizational conditions that will ensure the efficient implementation of these structural projects; () all wages and working conditions set out in the contracts and collective agreements are the result of free and voluntary collective bargaining and the contracts or collective agreements, as well as having been freely agreed on with the trade unions, contain no discriminatory provisions; () in the collective bargaining process within the enterprise the trade union organizations can exercise their constitutional right to agree on terms of employment, and the collective instruments provide for benefits far superior to those accorded in other contracts or collective agreements concluded in Chile. For its part, the Government states that: () FESUC has exercised its right to approach the ILO, but without having first exhausted the remedies available at the national level; and () it should be emphasized that certain provisions of the Constitution relating to the fundamental rights of individuals, the mechanisms for the protection of those rights, the functions of the state authorities and the agencies responsible for monitoring the legality of certain administrative acts and other laws all demonstrate that this country has a democratic system subject to effective checks and balances.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that, with the exception of organizations representing categories of workers which may be excluded from the scope of Convention No. , such as the armed forces, the police and public servants engaged in the administration of the State, recognition of the right to collective bargaining is general in scope and all other organizations of workers in the public and private sectors must benefit from it. This being the case, recalling the principle according to which  temporary workers should be able to negotiate collectively' (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ), and while noting that neither the enterprise nor the Government referred to the specific allegations pertaining to this case, and restricting itself to observing that the right to collective bargaining is fully respected in the enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to take the appropriate measures, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that the respective workers' organizations will be able to bargain collectively on behalf of all workers, including those with temporary contracts for work or services, and also those serving as superintendents or directors.
.Regarding the allegation that the application of article  of the Labour Code, which requires non-union workers who enjoy benefits provided under a collective instrument to pay  per cent of the ordinary monthly union dues, discourages exercise of the right to organize, the Committee points out that it has stated on numerous occasions that, when legislation admits trade union security clauses, such as the withholding of trade union dues from the wages of non-members benefiting from the conclusion of a collective agreement, those clauses should only take effect through collective agreements [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to take the appropriate measures, including legislative if necessary, to ensure respect for this principle.
.Regarding the allegation that, under articles  et seq. of the Labour Code, the enterprise declared illegal a work stoppage called against the policy applied by the state enterprise with a view to pushing forward its transformation plans, because these were being developed outside the collective bargaining process, the Committee notes that the enterprise has stated that: () in the light of the depletion of productive resources a new business strategy has been formed, known as  structural projects'  and this strategy has resulted in decisions setting in place organizational conditions that will ensure the efficient implementation of these structural projects; and () it recognizes the right of workers to take action, including strike action. In this regard, the Committee points out that  the occupational and economic interests which workers defend through the exercise of the right to strike do not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social policy questions and problems facing the undertaking which are of direct concern to the workers' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take all appropriate measures, including legislative if necessary, to uphold this principle.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that, during its review of the application of Conventions Nos  and , the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) examined several issues of law arising in this case and noted that the Government had reiterated its willingness to incorporate into the relevant national legislation all the necessary provisions to ensure prompt alignment with the Conventions in question. The Committee trusts that, as part of the legislative reforms referred to by the Government, the principles identified in this case will be fully taken into account, and draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the CEACR.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures, including legislative if necessary, to ensure that the respective workers' organizations will be able to bargain collectively on behalf of all workers, including those with temporary contracts for work or services, and also those serving as superintendents or directors.(b) Recalling the principle that the occupational and economic interests which the workers defend through the exercise of the right to strike do not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social policy questions and problems facing the undertaking which are of direct concern to the workers (see Digest, op. cit., para. ), the Committee requests the Government to take all appropriate measures, including legislative if necessary, to uphold this principle.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the appropriate measures, including legislative if necessary, to guarantee the respect for the principles enunciated in its conclusions, and draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",2,2012,Chile

.In its communication of  March , the CBT alleges that, in view of the lack of adequate maintenance carried out on the buses used by the Alsacia enterprise, the trade union officials were obliged to carry out a maintenance check on the buses to ensure they were in good working order for both workers and passengers. When the trade union officials performed the maintenance check, numerous irregularities were found, resulting from a lack of maintenance, which resulted in a collective complaint and demands for the enterprise to find immediate solutions. The CBT adds that the extreme lack of maintenance on the buses was also observed by the Chilean police who, on the request of the trade union organization, came to check the level of wear and tear on a number of buses.
.The CBT adds that the severity of the issues found during the maintenance check obliged the trade union officials to initiate collective action in which only the buses that complied with the applicable safety standards were permitted to depart. The enterprise responded with intimidation and arrogance, and despite the trade union officials showing it the irregularities found in the buses that would require maintenance work before they could be approved for departure to ensure the safety of both passengers and drivers, the enterprise response was to initiate proceedings to lift the trade union immunity of the  trade union officials who took part in the collective action.
.In its communication dated  March , the CBT states that since the establishment of the Inter-enterprise Trade Union of the Tur Bus Holding (SITHOTUR) the enterprise has tried to prevent its creation. Two days after the establishment of the trade union in September , two trade union officials were dismissed from the enterprises Tur Bus Ltd and Cndor Bus Ltd respectively (both enterprises belong to the same commercial firm). The trade union officials in question were later reinstated.
.The CBT adds that on a number of occasions the trade union organization requested that an inspection be carried out of the enterprise Tur Bus Ltd, particularly in respect of health and safety, in its various workplaces at the national level and, specifically, in the localities of Santiago, Arica, Iquique, San Carlos, Antofagasta (in this particular locality temporary closure was requested owing to the repeated transgression of labour rights noted by the Provincial Labour Inspectorate). The complainant organization also states that a working group met on  and  September , and asked that the trade union organization be legitimized in accordance with ILO Conventions Nos  and , and requested elements of personal protection for workers in keeping with the activities they performed and authorization to give information talks on occupational safety, health and hygiene and on labour law, in the cities of Santiago and Antofagasta.
.The CBT alleges that in this context the enterprise initiated proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity against the officials of the SITHOTUR trade union organization. The complainants consider it strange that despite it being a matter of the same things happening on the same dates, the courts of law rejected the application to lift the trade union immunity of Mr Carlos Chamblas, yet allowed the lifting of the trade union immunity of Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar, Vice-President of the CBT, who was performing trade union activities.
.In its communication of  March , the FNTP said that following the bankruptcy of the urban passenger transport enterprise Buses Gran Santiago, the Government, following a series of meetings between the various parties, including the workers represented by their trade union officials, gave the tender for its services to two new enterprises, one of which was Car Bus Urbano, belonging to the multinational group Veolia, which absorbed a large number of the workers who had lost their jobs as a result of the bankruptcy and a very small number of trade union officials.
.The complainant organization states that officials from the Buses Gran Santiago and Express Santiago Uno Inter-enterprise Trade Union participated in the job application process and signed their respective contracts. It adds that the representatives of the enterprise administration, who were from the bankrupt enterprise, were perfectly aware that a number of workers were trade union officials. The organization alleges that, on  November , a number of trade union officials were dismissed (including the President, the Secretary and the Treasurer) with the enterprise citing the reason as the expiration of their employment contracts, but the complainant organization maintains that the reason for the dismissals was that they were trade union officials. The organization indicates that following this incident the matter was brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate. The President of the Confederation of Transport intervened and the reinstatement of the trade union officials was ordered, but this did not occur owing to the systematic refusal of the Car Bus Urbano enterprise.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the Alsacia enterprise says in respect of the complaint by the CBT that, on  May , on the premises of the enterprise, a group of trade union officials, including some allegedly representing the CBT, participated in an act described as sabotage and illegal. This act allegedly consisted of obstructing the departure of numerous buses at rush hour, which disrupted the public transportation of passengers in the city of Santiago. The enterprise says that it suffered economic harm and it indicates that it initiated proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity against  trade union officials. In one of the cases an agreement was reached that resulted in the dismissal of the trade union official by mutual accord and in the others the courts considered that the facts had been sufficiently serious to warrant the lifting of the officials' trade union immunity. Annulment proceedings were brought against the judgments stipulating the lifting of trade union immunity before the Santiago Court of Appeals, which dismissed them, upholding the enterprise s request.
.The enterprise also indicates that in a letter sent to the CBT it stated, inter alia, that it was not in agreement with the maintenance check that the workers and trade union officials carried out on the enterprise s buses. It told them that neither the internal regulations nor the individual employment contracts authorized conduct of that sort by the bus operators, as a specific procedure was in place that operators must use to report any faults or damage to the buses. Lastly, the enterprise says that up until  October , there were  trade unions and  trade union officials. Moreover, a collective bargaining process had been completed which resulted in the establishment of criteria to improve service to bus users, where workers had the opportunity to air their legitimate interests.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the Tur Bus Ltd, the Government states that according to the enterprise the General Manager of the enterprise sent a letter explaining the situation of the trade union official, Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar. The letter indicated that his actions contravened the law, prompting the initiation of proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity. The court, on the basis of the evidence provided and the arguments presented by the parties, concluded that the actions taken by Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar were illegal and constituted grounds for the lifting of trade union immunity. The enterprise adds that the trade union official lodged an appeal against the first-instance ruling, which was refused, with the lifting of trade union immunity consequently being upheld. That judgment was appealed in cassation proceedings regarding its substance before the Supreme Court of Chile, which declared the appeal inadmissible. Lastly, there are ten trade union organizations at the enterprise, six of which have signed collective agreements, and the trade union membership rate is  per cent of a total of more than , workers.
.With regard to the complaint concerning workers at the Car Bus Urbano SA enterprise, the Government states that the Labour Directorate of Chile has indicated that in view of reports of violations of fundamental rights, it conducted inquiries into the cases of Miguel ngel lvarez Godoy, Hctor Lara Fernndez, Alfredo Fuentes Meneses and Marcelo Jerez Rubilar, and violations were found to have occurred in all of them, with conciliation agreements being reached in court and the workers receiving compensation.
.The Government indicates that on the basis of the facts provided by the complainant organizations and the employers it conducted an assessment to analyse the possible existence of acts of anti-union discrimination by the Government of",0,2012,Chile
52,"Chile from the perspective of ILO Conventions Nos  and . In respect of the Alsacia enterprise, the Government refers to the judgment handed down by the Second Labour Court of the Municipality of Santiago in the action initiated by the enterprise, which states: ()  it has been established that the defendants prevented the departure of approximately  per cent of the fleet at the Maip depot, without a valid reason, which disrupted the normal running of the enterprise'  ()  the elements established by law that justify the grounds being invoked have been met, as it is clear that the defendants engaged in an action preventing the buses from leaving the depot in an unjustified manner, resulting in the plaintiff enterprise not being able to operate in the normal manner, which consists of the public transportation of passengers during the rush hour'  ()  the defendants participated directly in actions that they are neither authorized nor justified to undertake, obstructing the departure of the enterprise s buses and not completing the tasks they were employed to perform by the enterprise'  and ()  in the view of this judge, this lack of compliance is serious, if account is taken of the way the events unfolded, the time chosen to carry out the action, which is entirely unfounded, the fact that the enterprise was not even informed about it, the delay in the departure of the buses, affecting part of the population, preventing without any justification the departure of the buses, facts that lead to the conclusion that the defendants seriously breached their contractual obligations'  The Santiago Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal against this judgment.
.The Government also refers to judgment No. -,  Tur Bus Ltd v. Ortega Salazar'  handed down by the Seventh Labour Court of Santiago, and to the judgments handed down by the Court of Appeals of Santiago and the Supreme Court of Chile relating to the case. The judgments refer to article () of the Labour Code, namely  serious failure to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the employment contract'  The Government indicates that the Court of First Instance considered, once it had analysed the case using all legal procedures for gathering and examining evidence, that Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar violated provisions relating to workers' rest and the internal regulations of the enterprise (paragraph ), and also refused to be monitored by the route inspectors on a number of occasions, and therefore found that  the serious failure to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the employment contract ... not only requires the worker to have failed to fulfil some of the obligations stipulated in the contract, which occurred in the case in question, but also that the failure to fulfil the obligations is of a nature and magnitude that affects the essence of the fulfilment of the contractual obligations, and as such goes beyond minor infringements accepted by the parties or the law'  The higher bodies rejected the appeals lodged.
.The Government states that it should be recalled in this case relating to proceedings for the lifting of the trade union immunity of trade union officials at the Alsacia and Tur Bus Ltd enterprises, that legislation, at both the constitutional and legal levels, upholds the principles of equality, non-discrimination and due process. The Government stresses that Convention No.  establishes, in Article , that  workers and employers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land'  which, according to the judgments handed down by the abovementioned national courts, has not been respected by the complainants. In turn, they have had procedural opportunities and have exercised their constitutional rights without any form of obstruction by Chilean state bodies. Trade union immunity is not absolute and, for serious and well-founded reasons, it can be cancelled and the decision taken to dismiss the trade union official should the circumstances require it. The Government indicates that in Chile it is the courts of law that are called on to determine the relevance of this by way of legal proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity. It is to be noted that these proceedings are conducted in strict compliance with the rules of due process. Lastly, the Government states that the Labour Directorate of Chile has fulfilled its supervisory role and that the courts of justice have concluded the proceedings in accordance with the law and have resolved the cases in full compliance with legislation.
.The Committee observes that the CBT and the FNTP allege acts of anti-union discrimination (dismissals and proceedings to lift trade union immunity) against trade union officials and members in various enterprises in the transport sector.
.The Committee observes that the CBT alleges that the enterprise initiated proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity against  trade union officials who took part in an activity that prevented the departure of buses that did not comply with prevailing safety standards, to ensure they were in good working order for both workers and passengers. In this respect, the Committee notes the Government s indication that the enterprise said that: () on  May , on the premises of the enterprise, a group of trade union officials, including some allegedly representing the CBT, participated in an act described as sabotage and illegal: obstructing the departure of numerous buses at rush hour, which disrupted the public transportation of passengers in the city of Santiago; () it suffered economic harm and it indicates that it initiated proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity against  trade union officials, obtaining favourable rulings, and in one of the cases an agreement was reached at the judicial level that resulted in the dismissal of the trade union official by mutual accord; () the courts considered that the facts had been sufficiently serious to authorize the lifting of the officials' trade union immunity; () annulment proceedings were brought against the judgments stipulating the lifting of trade union immunity before the Santiago Court of Appeals, which dismissed them, upholding the enterprise s request; () in a letter sent to the CBT it stated, inter alia, that it was not in agreement with the maintenance check that the workers and trade union officials carried out on the enterprise s buses and it told them that neither the internal regulations nor the individual employment contracts authorized conduct of that sort by the bus operators, as a specific procedure was in place that operators must use to report any faults or damage to the buses; and () up until  October , there were  trade unions and  trade union officials and a collective bargaining process had been completed which resulted in the establishment of criteria to improve service to bus users, where workers had the opportunity to air their legitimate interests.

.The Committee takes note of this information, and particularly the fact that the judicial authorities examined the alleged cases and granted the requests for the lifting of trade union immunity lodged by the enterprise. In these circumstances, and in the absence of other information, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of these allegations.
.The Committee notes the allegation by the complainant organization CBT that the Tur Bus Ltd transport enterprise did not respect an agreement reached in the working group, did not",-1,2012,Chile
53,"allow a meeting of trade union officials to be held on the premises of the enterprise in the city of Antofagasta and initiated proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity against two trade union officials (while the judicial authority dismissed one of the requests, it approved the lifting of the trade union immunity of the Vice-President of the CBT, Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar). In this regard, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the enterprise provided the following information: () the General Manager of the enterprise sent a letter explaining the situation of the trade union official, Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar; () the letter states that his actions contravened the law, prompting the initiation of proceedings for the lifting of trade union immunity; () the court, on the basis of the evidence provided and the arguments presented by the parties, reached the conclusion that the actions taken by Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar were illegal and constituted grounds for the lifting of trade union immunity; () the trade union official lodged an appeal against the first-instance ruling which was refused, with the lifting of trade union immunity consequently being confirmed; () that judgment was appealed in cassation proceedings regarding its substance before the Supreme Court of Chile, which declared the appeal inadmissible; and () there are ten trade union organizations at the enterprise, six of which have signed collective agreements and the trade union membership rate is  per cent of a total of more than , workers.
.The Government draws attention to judgment No. -,  Tur Bus Ltd v. Ortega Salazar'  handed down by the Seventh Labour Court of Santiago, and to the judgments handed down by the Court of Appeals of Santiago and the Supreme Court of Chile relating to the case. The judgments refer to article () of the Labour Code, namely  serious failure to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the employment contract'  The Government indicates that the Court of First Instance considered, once it had analysed the case using all legal procedures for gathering and examining evidence, that Mr Marcelo Ortega Salazar violated provisions relating to workers' rest and the internal regulations of the enterprise, and also refused to be monitored by the route inspectors on a number of occasions, and therefore found that the  serious failure to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the employment contract ... not only requires the worker to have failed to fulfil some of the obligations stipulated in the contract, which occurred in the case in question, but also that the failure to fulfil the obligations is of a nature and magnitude that affects the essence of the fulfilment of the contractual obligations, and as such goes beyond minor infringements accepted by the parties or the law'  The higher bodies rejected the appeals lodged by the trade unionist mentioned.
.The Committee notes this information and will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The Committee observes that the FNTP alleges the anti-union dismissal from the Car Bus Urbano enterprise of a number of trade union officials (including the President, the Secretary and the Treasurer) belonging to the Buses Gran Santiago and Express Santiago Uno Inter-enterprise Trade Union and that although the labour inspectorate ordered the reinstatement of the trade union officials, the enterprise has refused to comply. In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the Labour Directorate of Chile has stated that in view of reports of violations of fundamental rights, it conducted inquiries into the cases of Miguel ngel lvarez Godoy, Hctor Lara Fernndez, Alfredo Fuentes Meneses and Marcelo Jerez Rubilar, and violations were found to have occurred in all of them, with conciliation agreements being reached in court and the workers receiving compensation. The Committee recalls that, in cases of the dismissal of trade unionists on the grounds of their trade union membership or activities, it has requested the Government to take the necessary measures to enable trade union leaders and members who had been dismissed due to their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the enterprises concerned of the corresponding legal sanctions [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].

.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  October , the CONFUSAM, ANEF, SME, CONUTT, FESINEM, FETRAINPES, CONGEMAR, FENPRUS, the Temporary Trade Unions, the Coordinating Confederation of Commerce Trade Unions, the Temporary Workers' Federation, the Pharmacies Federation, the North-West Trade Union, the Banking Confederation and the Tresmontes Lucchetti Subcontractors allege that the Government has recently submitted a bill to Parliament which, if approved, would ' as is the case with most current legislation ' violate the principles of freedom of association and Conventions Nos ,  and , as it not only criminalizes a range of legitimate trade union protests and actions (occupying workplaces and streets) but also makes workers' representatives who organize such activities criminally liable for any public disorder that occurs. Furthermore, public disorder has been upgraded from a minor to a more serious offence.
.The complainants consider that, if approved, this legal initiative would criminalize strikes, occupations and pickets, and that hundreds of social and union leaders would be prosecuted and held in custody while on trial, even if the accused were innocent. Specifically, the bill contains the following provisions:Section one. Amend the Penal Code as follows:()	In section , add the following subparagraph :  This section shall be understood to cover members of the forces of law and order and public security and officials of the Gendarmerie of Chile going about their duties.' )	Replace section  with the following:Section . The offences referred to in the previous section shall be punishable by a short-term prison sentence of medium length if any of the following circumstances pertain:a.	If an attack involves the use of weapons.a.	If, as a result of coercion, the authorities agree to the perpetrators' demands.If attacks involve assault against the authorities or those coming to their aid, the penalty shall be a short-term prison sentence of minimum to medium length.If these circumstances do not apply, the penalty shall be a short-term prison sentence of minimum length.In determining whether an attack has involved the use of weapons, the provisions of section  and the Arms Control Act, No.  shall apply.The penalties stipulated in this section shall be imposed if an attack against the authorities does not constitute an offence for which a greater penalty is established in law, in which case only the greater penalty shall be imposed.()	Substitute the following for section :Section . Those who take part in disorder or any other act of force or violence involving any of the following shall be punishable by a short-term prison sentence of medium length:.	Paralysing or interrupting any public service, such as hospital or emergency services or those that provide electricity, fuel, drinking water, communications and transport;.	Invading, occupying or looting houses, offices or commercial, industrial, educational, religious or any other establishments, whether private, public or municipal;.	Impeding or altering the free movement of persons or vehicles along bridges, roads, highways or other similar areas used by the public;.	Attacking the authorities or their agents contrary to sections  or  or in any of the ways set out in sections , bis, ter and  of the Code of Military Justice or in sections , bis, ter and quater of Decree Law No.  of  or in sections A, B, C and D of Decree Law No.  of , as applicable;.	Using firearms, cutting or stabbing implements, or explosive, incendiary, chemical or other devices or materials capable of causing harm to persons or property; or.	Causing damage to the property of others, whether publicly, municipally or individually owned.The penalty provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be imposed without prejudice to any other penalty, as appropriate, to which the perpetrators may also be liable for their involvement in damage, arson, attacks, robbery, offences under the Arms Control Act, No.  or, in general, other offences committed in connection with the disorder or acts of force or violence.Those who incite, promote or encourage disorder or other acts of force or violence that involve any of the factors mentioned in the first paragraph, provided that their occurrence was foreseen by the perpetrators, shall be punishable by a short-term prison sentence of medium length.()	Add, after section , the following new sections -A and -B:Section -A: Any person who impedes or hinders the actions of members of the Fire Brigade or other public services intended to provide assistance in emergencies or other disasters or incidents that pose a threat to the safety of persons shall be punishable by a short term prison sentence of medium length, unless their actions constitute another offence incurring a greater penalty.Section -B: For the offences covered by paragraphs , bis and  of this part, the perpetrators shall incur the maximum penalty, if the penalty has only one degree, or a penalty other than the minimum, if it has two or more degrees, if the offence was committed with faces obscured or in any other manner such as to impede, hinder or delay the identification of those responsible.Section two  his bill is signed by the President of the Republic, the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice, as provided for in law.
.According to the complainants, this bill is a legal aberration that seeks to resolve social conflicts by jailing those who dissent or who do not agree with the decisions or actions of the Government, a ministry, an enterprise or a service, and thereby seriously undermines the basis of a plural and democratic society. According to the complaints, their opinion of the bill is shared by experts in relevant legal matters, who, among other things, have pointed out that the legislation as drafted would give rise to many doubts among judges in view of the significant problems of placing an interpretation on  violence or public disorder'   disorder offences have always been problematic, because the description given by the legislator is never sufficient to cover all circumstances'  and looting is robbery with force and the State Security Act exists to punish incitement to violence, so new legislation is not required.
.The complainants add that a significant group of trade union leaders from various sectors and branches of production in both the public and private sphere recently requested the Government to withdraw this legal initiative, but without success; they will therefore shortly request Parliament not to process this governmental initiative. The complainants express their concern at the fact that the Government has chosen the logic of repression to tackle social conflicts and is continuing along the path of failing to honour its international commitments, is not respecting ILO Conventions that it freely agreed to ratify and, far from rectifying this unlawful behaviour, is attempting to reduce its compliance even further. Lastly, the complainants request that a mission be sent to Chile to meet all those concerned, with the aim of finding specific ways to halt the systematic violation of ILO standards that Chile has ratified and to amend legislation and make the necessary administrative changes to harmonize all Chilean laws with the ILO standards ratified by the Chilean State.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that the bill to strengthen public order is intended to protect those who wish to demonstrate peacefully and punish those who resort to violence and cause serious public disorder when strikes occur. According to the Government, it is vital to point out that this bill is not an existing provision of Chilean legislation, but merely a proposal from the Executive Authority submitted to the National Congress in October  for due parliamentary debate by democratically elected representatives. It is currently being discussed by the National Congress and has not been approved.
.The Government adds that, as a result of the discussion among deputies in the National Congress, the content of the above bill has changed substantially since the complaint was presented (the Government has sent the most recent version of the bill, bulletin No.  , approved by the Public Security and Drugs Committee of the House of Deputies in August ). Lastly, the Government reiterates that approval or rejection of this legal initiative by the National Congress is still pending.",0,2011,Chile
55,"Nevertheless, even if it is approved as currently drafted, it would not violate the ILO Conventions cited by the complainants either in form or in substance, as it protects those who demonstrate peacefully and punishes those who cause serious public disorder with violence or intimidation. In reality, the provisions of the bill that are referred to, as well as representing common sense, are fully in line with the fundamental principles of trade unionism and the relevant criterion established by bodies involved in monitoring compliance with ILO Conventions.
.The Committee observes that the complainants allege that the Government has submitted a bill to Parliament which, if approved, would violate the principles of freedom of association and Conventions Nos ,  and , as it not only criminalizes a range of legitimate trade union protests and actions (occupying workplaces and streets) but also makes workers' representatives who organize such activities criminally liable for any public disorder that occurs.
.In this respect, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the bill to strengthen public order is intended to protect those who wish to demonstrate peacefully, punishing those who resort to violence and cause serious public disorder when a demonstration occurs; () this is not an existing provision of Chilean legislation, but merely a proposal from the Executive Authority, submitted to the National Congress in October  for due parliamentary debate by democratically elected representatives, which is currently being discussed by the National Congress and has not been approved; () as a result of discussion among deputies in the National Congress, the content of the above bill has changed substantially since the complaint was presented (the Government has sent the most recent version of the bill, bulletin No. -, approved by the Public Security and Drugs Committee of the House of Deputies in August ); () approval or rejection of this legal initiative by the National Congress is still pending but, nevertheless, even if it is approved as currently drafted, it would not violate the ILO Conventions cited by the complainants, as it protects those who demonstrate peacefully and punishes those who cause serious public disorder with violence or intimidation; and () the provisions of the bill are fully in line with the fundamental principles of trade unionism and the relevant criterion established by bodies involved in monitoring compliance with ILO Conventions.
.The Committee observes that the content of the bill, as provided by the complainants, includes provisions intended to punish those who commit or instigate disorder or acts of force or violence involving, among other things: paralysing or interrupting hospital or emergency services or those that provide electricity, fuel, drinking water, communications and transport; invading, occupying or looting houses, offices or commercial, industrial, educational, religious or any other establishments, whether private, public or municipal; or impeding or altering the free movement of persons or vehicles along bridges, roads, highways or other similar areas used by the public. However, the Committee observes that a new version of the bill, supplied by the Government, differs in that, for instance, it provides for those who take part in  serious' disorder to be punishable by a short-term prison sentence of minimum to medium length and that public disorder shall be considered serious if it involves any of the following: () paralysing or interrupting, by means of force against property or violence or intimidation against persons, any public service, such as hospital or emergency services or those that provide electricity, fuel, drinking water, communications and transport; () invading, with violence or intimidation against persons and without the consent of the owners, houses, offices or commercial, industrial, educational, religious or any other establishments, whether private, public or municipal; () looting houses, offices or commercial, industrial, educational, religious or any other establishments, whether private, public or municipal; () impeding or altering, with violence or intimidation against persons, free movement along bridges, roads, highways or other similar areas used by the public and resisting actions by the authorities; () attacks on the authorities; () use of firearms; and () causing damage to the property of others.
.The Committee recalls that  the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike' and that  trade unions should respect legal provisions which are intended to ensure the maintenance of public order; the public authorities should, for their part, refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of trade unions to organize the holding and proceedings of their meetings in full freedom'  in particular  during labour disputes' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras ,  and ]. The Committee also recalls that the right to demonstrate and the right to strike, peacefully exercised, are essential elements of freedom of association and that, in exercising the rights provided for in this Convention, workers and employers and their respective organizations, like other persons or organized collectivities, shall respect the law of the land. Moreover, the Committee indicates that the authorities should not resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of, or participation in, a peaceful strike; such measures entail serious risks of abuse and are a grave threat to freedom of association (see Digest, op. cit., paragraph ).
.Under these circumstances, observing that the bill to which the complainants object has been replaced by another text supplied by the Government, the Committee emphasizes that the final text of the bill must not allow for interpretations susceptible to infringe the right to carry out peaceful demonstrations and strikes, and firmly expects that consultations will be held on the bill in question with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations and that the above principles and considerations will be duly taken into account.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee firmly expects that consultations will be held with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations on the final draft of the bill to introduce certain amendments to the Penal Code and that the principles referred to in its conclusions will be duly taken into account.",-1,2011,Chile
56,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association of Internal Revenue Officials of Chile (ANEIICH) and the Association of Internal Revenue Inspectors of Chile (AFIICH), dated October . The complainant organizations sent additional information in a communication dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated October , the National Association of Internal Revenue Officials of Chile (ANEIICH) and the Association of Internal Revenue Inspectors of Chile (AFIICH) state that they are presenting a complaint for a violation of freedom of association on account of the application of regulations by the higher authority of the Internal Revenue Bureau (SII), which prohibit bargaining and strikes, with respect to the stoppage that occurred during the last negotiations in the  general public sector pay review' held in November and December . According to the complainant organizations, the SII, through judicial actions by its national director and deputy legal director, has defended the application of regulations that infringe the rights of public servants recognized in the freedom of association Conventions, and particularly ILO Convention No. , and has supported the application of obsolete provisions of the Political Constitution and the Administrative Statute which prohibit strikes and bargaining in the public sector, particularly section (i) of the Administrative Statute, which prohibits the organization or promotion of strikes or participation therein and the total or partial interruption or stoppage of work.
.The complainants indicate that since the restoration of democratic institutions in , Chilean governments have negotiated the  general public sector pay review' with the Public Sector Board coordinated by the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) which includes the presidents of the following workers' organizations: ANEF, AJUNJI, ANTUE, ASEMUCH, the Teachers' Association of Chile, CONFUSAM, CONFEMUCH, CONFENATS, the Nurses' Association of Chile, FENAFUCH, FENAFUECH, FENTESS, FENATS Unitaria, FAUECH, FENPRUSS and FENFUSSAP. The negotiations are held in October and November each year and, on account of the statutory nature of the legal relationship between public servants and the State as their employer, once the meetings between the parties have been concluded, the Executive refers the respective draft legislation to the National Congress, with or without the agreement of the parties, as the case may be. These negotiations have not always resulted in the conclusion of agreements between the parties, and on many occasions public officials have had to use strike action to exert pressure to secure an improved proposal from the Government.
.The complainants add that the general membership of the representative organizations of public servants and workers involved in the negotiations is estimated at approximately , public servants, and the agreements negotiated cover more than , public servants. The practice of public sector collective bargaining in Chile goes beyond the content of constitutional and legal standards, which do not recognize or regulate public servants' right to negotiate. The parties to the negotiations are constituted by the public sector organizations and the State, according to the levels concerned, represented by the respective public authorities, under the supervision of the Budget Directorate at the Ministry of Finance, particularly the Rationalization and Public Service Division. The benefits obtained in the negotiations are of general application, as a result of the legal system which regulates pay in the sector, so that the benefits negotiated apply to all officials in the departments affiliated to the negotiating organization.
.According to the complainants, through the National Association of Fiscal Employees (ANEF), three sectoral agreements have also been negotiated with the Government, on the basis of which the following laws were enacted: Act No.  on the modernization of the State and public management, the  New Deal' Act No. , and Act No.  amending both of these Acts and establishing retirement incentives. The complainants indicate that they have participated in the modernization process of the Bureau in which they work, achieving an excellent level of service. They also indicate that the last report sent by Chile to the ILO in , concerning the effect given to ILO Convention No. , indicated the following:  National practice relating to the Convention. (a) General agreements between the Government and public sector trade unions. Under the coalition governments from  to the present, an annual practice has been established under which the Government and the representatives of the various associations of public servants negotiate a general review of pay. The participating bodies are public sector unions at the central, decentralized and municipal levels, transferred services, associations of municipal teachers and subsidized private educational establishments, including those under delegated administration, and state universities. The public sector is coordinated by the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT). The Government in turn is represented by the Finance Minister and the Minister of Labour and Social Security.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainants assert that the Government cannot disregard the right of public servants to engage in collective bargaining since it is under the obligation to adopt appropriate measures to ensure compliance with ILO Convention No.  and, in this context, it has maintained a practice of incorporating negotiation as a mechanism for defining common conditions of work and pay for public servants, agreeing upon pay benefits and incentive systems which are applicable throughout the public administration.
.The complainants indicate that the bargaining practices developed over the past  years between the public authorities and various workers' organizations representing public servants are part of a policy which, until , recognized the right of public servants to participate in the determination of their common terms and conditions of employment. In accordance with this practice, SII officials participated in good faith, protected by national practice in accordance with the obligations of the State relating to freedom of association, in the negotiations for the public sector review in  and also exercised in good faith the right to strike, as has occurred on many occasions over the last  years.
.The complainants allege that, following the negotiations for the last public sector pay review and the work stoppage undertaken by public servants at the end of , various public services docked the pay of workers who had participated in the work stoppage, claiming that they were obliged to do so under the terms of section  of the Administrative Statute, which provides that no remuneration can be paid for time not actually worked. In order to make the specific deductions, the respective authorities asked the middle management for reports, thus gathering information of variable quality and accuracy which resulted in the application of arbitrary and illegal deductions.
.In the case of the SII, on  January  the amounts of pay corresponding to the period for which pay was due on  January  were not published in the usual way. The officials of the organizations concerned therefore contacted the person responsible in order to make inquiries, whereupon it was indicated that pay deductions would be made. In this context, on  January , the Director of the SII and its Deputy Director of Human Resources confirmed that deductions ordered by the Finance Minister, according to indications in the meeting, had been made from the pay of officials who had reportedly participated in the stoppage and protests convened by the Public Sector Board, on the basis of lists drawn up informally by regional managers, without informing those affected or their associations.
.The complainants state that, in accordance with the powers granted to them by Act No. , they asked the authorities for information on the names of the officials who were members and whose pay had been subject to deductions in January and the respective amounts for each of them in relation to the ANEF protest days, and also asked for the supporting documents relating to the deductions to be sent to them, which was refused. The associations of public servants then brought an action for the protection of constitutional rights provided for under Chilean law, claiming that the deductions were illegal and arbitrary. It was obvious that the arbitrary and disproportionate nature of the deductions masked the intention to weaken the exercise of the right to strike and the organizations concerned, since it affected a substantial number of members, under circumstances when the work stoppage was absolutely legitimate and was undertaken in good faith, in a process of regular negotiation with the political authority, within the framework of the practical application of ILO Convention No. , and in the same way as over the past  years.
.The complainants state that the claims for protection gave rise to protection appeals Nos - and -, challenging the legality of the pay deductions affecting , officials, with amounts disproportionate to the scale of the stoppage, and through arbitrary procedures that did not comply with basic guarantees of administrative procedure. According to the complainants, on  September  the Seventh Chamber of",0,2011,Chile
57,"the Court of Appeal of Santiago upheld the appeals for the protection of their rights filed by the organizations concerned, declaring that the practices were in violation of the constitutional guarantees of the persons affected, as mass deductions had been made without following appropriate procedures. The Court ordered the repayment of the amounts deducted and declared that no deductions should be made as the result of a work stoppage unless the periods not worked were determined beyond doubt, at least by means of a proper summary investigation. The rulings recognize the authority of the department to take decisions within its sphere of competence, but take issue with the legality of the deductions made by the SII owing to flaws of control and procedure, and the failure to observe the principles of transparency and impartiality established in Act No.  on the basic administrative procedures for state bodies.
.According to the complainants, during the examination of the appeal, the SII expressed its intention of penalizing the exercise of trade union rights by reiterating that the work stoppage infringed the prohibition on the organization or promotion of strikes or participation therein and on the total or partial interruption or stoppage of work, as laid down by section (i) of the Administrative Statute. Even more seriously, as a logical consequence of deeming the exercise of strike action to be an infringement of the prohibitions laid down in the Administrative Statute, this exposes workers to the application of the regulations governing administrative liability, involving a summary investigation or administrative proceedings, as referred to by sections  and  of the Administrative Statute. Section  provides that any employee who infringes his or her official obligations or duties may be liable to censure in his or her staff file or to disciplinary measures. The same section adds that officials shall incur administrative liability if the infringement of their duties and obligations is such as to incur disciplinary measures, which shall be certified by means of a summary investigation or administrative proceedings. Section  provides that officials may be subject to the following disciplinary measures: (a) reprimand; (b) a fine; (c) suspension from duty ranging from  days to three months; and (d) dismissal. The disciplinary measures shall be applied taking into account the seriousness of the misconduct and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances derived from the past record of the person concerned.
.The complainants consider that, in this context, if the decision of the SII were to be maintained, and if it were to be upheld by the ruling of the Supreme Court, which will finally settle the appeals for protection filed by the complainant organizations, the application of the regulations prohibiting the exercise of the right to strike will result in the dismissal of any officials who have participated or will participate in future in stoppages, which represents a violation of freedom of association that is unprecedented in the democratic history of Chile, and can only be compared to the persecution of the Chilean trade union movement that occurred in the s.
.In short, the complainants state that: () the measures and definitions adopted by the Director of the Internal Revenue Bureau not only undermine the most important negotiations engaged in by Chilean public sector workers, but also threaten the employment of all the staff that have been arbitrarily identified and penalized by the authority for going on strike, since if the authority perseveres in its intention of calling for strikes in the public sector to be declared illegal, public servants could even face dismissal; () the lack of an appropriate mechanism for determining any deductions applicable in the event of stoppages cannot affect the right of public sector workers, particularly union members, to take industrial action, given the insistence of the higher authorities of the SII on applying the legal provisions that prohibit strikes in circumstances in which work stoppages are a legitimate means of exerting pressure that has been used by the organizations of Chilean public servants in their negotiations with complete legitimacy, even before the ratification of Convention No. , as was recognized by the Santiago Court of Appeal in the rulings issued on the complainants' appeals; and () the SII has not given any guarantees that it will respect the right to strike, which it considers illegal, stating that it will seek to establish administrative liability if the arbitrary pay deductions imposed on the union members are not accepted. This is an unacceptable condition since it means accepting the lack of an objective, transparent and fair mechanism or procedure for their determination, which would weaken the law itself. The complainants call for the Government to be asked to adopt measures as soon as possible to prevent the application of the prohibition of strikes in the public sector. Finally, in their communication of  May , the complainants report that they made a presentation to the Ethics Commission of the Supreme Court of Justice in relation with a member of the Court, which issued two rulings stating that the pay deductions were made in strict conformity with the law.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government recalls that the complaint by the ANEIICH and the AFIICH essentially alleges practices which affect freedom of association and collective bargaining in the public sector, the alleged non-observance of ILO Convention No.  in that regard, and the application of regulations by the higher authority of the SII prohibiting strikes. The actions of the SII authorities which, according to the complainants, were in violation of freedom of association and bargaining in the public sector, and affected public servants belonging to the ANEIICH and the AFIICH, are reported to be related to pay deductions in January  imposed on officials who took part in strikes and did not perform their normal duties.
.The Government subsequently asked the SII authorities for their observations on this matter, and the latter indicated that the deductions of pay from the officials concerned were in accordance with Chilean law, citing articles  and (), final paragraph, of the Political Constitution of the Republic; sections  and () of Act No. ; sections  and  of the Administrative Statute; and also the statements issued on this subject by the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic (CGR). The SII also indicated that, through the application of these legal provisions, and also the criteria laid down in the instructions and directives of the CGR, the pay unit of the Bureau, at the written request of the direct superiors, deducted pay for the time not worked from officials who took part in the work stoppage.
.As regards the procedure used by the SII to make the deductions, it indicated that the deduction procedure and the related documentation were submitted for legal review, as a result of the two appeals for protection filed by the SU Association of Officials. Both appeals were rejected by rulings of  January  handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice (Court register Nos - and -), which upheld the validity of the deductions and the procedure used. Furthermore, the SII indicated that the decisions of the Supreme Court concluded that the deduction procedure used by the SU was in strict accordance with the law and based on technical criteria, which led the Supreme Court of Justice to conclude that any alleged lack of reasonableness had to be dismissed and to find that the procedure followed was not by nature arbitrary.
.Lastly, as regards the denunciation of practices affecting the observance of ILO Convention No.  and the application by the SII higher authorities of legal provisions prohibiting strikes, the latter authority indicated that although Convention No.  protects the union rights of public servants, and that a broad interpretation could even be taken as protecting the right to collective bargaining, they consider that there can be no grounds for interpreting Convention No.  as protecting stoppages and strikes in the public sector, since the text of the Convention would be opposed to them. They add that Article  of Convention No.  (Part V, Settlement of Disputes) reads as follows:  The settlement of disputes arising in connection with the determination of terms and conditions of employment shall be sought, as may be appropriate to national conditions, through negotiation between the parties or through independent and impartial machinery, such as mediation, conciliation and arbitration, established in such a manner as to ensure the confidence of the parties involved'  and not through strikes, stoppages or protests, as occurred in the present case.
.The Government refers to the final paragraph of article () of the Political Constitution, which provides that:  Neither state nor municipal officials may go on strike; nor may people working for corporations or enterprises, regardless of the nature, objectives or functions thereof, that provide services of public utility, the interruption of which might seriously harm health, the economy of the country, public supplies or national security.' It is evident that the Chilean Constitution does not allow public servants ' including",-1,2011,Chile
58,"those employed by the SII ' to go on strike, as some officials in that institution did at the end of .
.In line with the above, the Government refers to the principle of legality established in article  ( the action of the bodies of the State must be subject to the Constitution and to the norms enacted in conformity therewith ...'  and article  of the Constitution ( The bodies of the State shall operate validly within their field of competence, and in the manner prescribed by law, after their members have been properly invested. The said bodies may not assume any other authority or rights than those expressly conferred upon them by the Constitution or the law' ; section () of Constitutional Organic Act No.  establishing the basic structure of the public administration, which provides that the  principle of administrative probity is violated' in particular by  failing to meet the obligations of efficiency, effectiveness and legality which govern the performance of public duties, with serious obstruction of the service or of the exercise of civic rights in relation to the Administration'  section (a) of the Administrative Statute, which indicates that one of the obligations of officials is to  personally discharge the duties of the post in a regular and constant manner ...'  and the final paragraph of section  of the Statute, which states that  officials shall perform their duties constantly during the ordinary working day'  All of the above lead to the conclusion that any failure to perform the duties of the post concerned in a constant and regular manner during the working day ' without the corresponding leave or authorization from the management ' could contravene the duties of efficiency, effectiveness and legality, and even the legal principle of administrative integrity.
.Moreover, as regards the regulations and the deductions made, it should be recalled that the right to remuneration is established in section  of the Administrative Statute, as follows:  officials shall be entitled to receive for their services the pay and any additional allowances established by law in a full and regular manner'  which presupposes the actual provision by officials of the services for which they were appointed. In addition, section  of the Statute provides as follows:  No pay shall be due for any time not actually worked, except in cases of paid public holidays, leave of authorized absence as provided for in the present Statute, cases of preventive suspension envisaged in section , or cases of unforeseen occurrences or force majeure. Reductions shall be made on a monthly basis, at the written request of the immediate superior, for any time not worked by employees, taking account of the fact that the pay corresponding to one day or one hour of work shall be the quotient obtained by dividing monthly pay by ,  or , respectively ...'  In the light of the above, it is clear that the law authorizes deductions from pay when the prescribed conditions are met.
.According to the Government, all the above, in conjunction with numerous opinions of the CGR regarding pay deductions (No.  of , No.  of , No.  of , No.  of  and No.  of , inter alia), lead to the conclusion that the SII authorities acted in accordance with the Constitution and national law, these actions being upheld on two occasions by the Supreme Court of Justice, the highest court in Chile.
.The Government states that the SII officials, in conformity with Organic Act DFL No.  of  of the Ministry of Finance and as members of a public supervisory body, exercise authority in the name of the State, their duties being the application and inspection of all internal taxes established by law or which may be established in the future.
.The Government insists that there has been no violation of Convention No. , which does not explicitly provide for the right to strike of public servants. Moreover, the interpretation of the Committee on Freedom of Association has been very clear in stating that the freedom of association of public servants does not necessarily imply the right to strike; that the latter can be restricted and prohibited in cases involving the exercise of authority in the name of the State (as in the case of the SII officials); and that pay deductions for strike days give rise to no objections with regard to freedom of association.
.Furthermore, according to the Government, based on a reading of Article  ( measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment between the public authorities concerned and public employees' organisations, or of such other methods as will allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of these matters'  and Article  ( the settlement of disputes arising in connection with the determination of terms and conditions of employment shall be sought, as may be appropriate to national conditions, through negotiation between the parties or through independent and impartial machinery, such as mediation, conciliation and arbitration, established in such a manner as to ensure the confidence of the parties involved'  of ILO Convention No. , it may be deduced that the means of settling disputes are not strikes, stoppages or protests, as occurred in the present case, but encouraging and promoting the use of independent and impartial procedures for negotiation between the authorities and the organizations of public employees, in accordance with national conditions and law, as is entirely the case in Chile.
.Lastly, the Government concludes that there is no evidence of any anti-union action or violation of ILO Conventions Nos ,  or  since the SII authorities acted in accordance with the law, having recourse to the judicial authorities established under the national legislation (as reviewed on two occasions by the highest court in the country), which found that the procedure used for the deduction of pay was in conformity with the law. Moreover, these deductions cannot be considered per se as an anti-union practice or a violation of ILO Convention No. , since there is no indication of how this Convention authorizes strikes in the public sector, an interpretation which is in line not only with national law, but also with the views of the Committee on Freedom of Association on this matter.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organizations allege that, following negotiations between the public authorities and various representative organizations of public servants regarding the general pay review at the end of , and after exercising the right to strike in good faith, a number of public services (in particular the SII) made deductions from the pay of workers who took part in the work stoppage in question, claiming that they were obliged to do so under the terms of section  of the Administrative Statute (which provides that no pay is due for time not actually worked). The complainant organizations also allege that in order to make the pay deductions the respective authorities requested reports from middle management, thus gathering information that was variable in terms of quality and accuracy, finally resulting in the application of arbitrary and illegal deductions, and that the measures taken by the SII did not respect the right to strike.
.The Committee notes that the Government has sent the observations of the SII, which indicates as follows: () the deductions of pay from officials were made in accordance with Chilean law (articles  and (), final paragraph, of the Political Constitution of the Republic; sections  and () of Act No. ; and sections  and  of the Administrative Statute) and in accordance with the statements issued on the matter by the Office of the CGR; () pursuant to these legal provisions and the criteria set out in the instructions and opinions of the CGR, the pay unit of the SII, at the written request of the direct superiors, applied the deductions resulting from the time not worked to the officials who had taken part in the work stoppage concerned; () the deduction procedure and the related records were submitted for judicial review, as a result of the two appeals for protection of their rights filed by the complainant organizations, both of which were set aside by rulings handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice on  January  (Court register Nos - and -), which upheld the validity of the deductions and the procedure used; and () the Supreme Court concluded that the deduction procedure used was in strict accordance with the law and based on technical criteria, which led it to find that any alleged lack of reasonableness had to be dismissed and that the procedure followed was not by nature arbitrary.
.The Committee also notes the Government s statement that: () the Political Constitution does not allow public servants ' including those working at",-1,2011,Chile
59,"the SII ' to go on strike, as a number of officials at that institution did at the end of ; () the principle of legality established in the Constitution, the Constitutional Organic Act establishing the basic structure of the public administration, and the Administrative Statute lead to the conclusion that any failure to perform the duties of the post concerned in a constant and regular manner during the working day ' without the corresponding leave of absence or authorization from the management ' could contravene the obligations of efficiency, effectiveness and legality, even affecting the legal principle of administrative integrity; () as regards the regulations applied and the deductions made, it should be recalled that the right to remuneration is established in section  of the Administrative Statute and the legislation authorizes deductions from pay when specific conditions are fulfilled; () all of the above, in conjunction with numerous opinions of the CGR regarding pay deductions, lead to the conclusion that the SII authorities acted in accordance with the Constitution and national law, as upheld on two occasions by the Supreme Court of Justice, the highest court in Chile; () the SII officials, in conformity with Organic Act DFL No.  of  of the Ministry of Finance and as members of a public supervisory body, exercise authority in the name of the State, their duties being the application and inspection of all internal taxes established by law or which will be established in the future; () the interpretation of the Committee on Freedom of Association has been very clear in stating that the freedom of association of public servants does not necessarily imply the right to strike, and that the latter can be restricted and prohibited in cases which involve the exercise of authority in the name of the State (as in the case of the SII officials) and that pay deductions for strike days give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association; and () there is no evidence of any anti-union action or violation of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and , since the SII authorities acted in accordance with the law, having recourse to the judicial authorities established under the national legislation (with a review on two occasions by the highest court in the country), which found in their respective decisions that the actions taken in the procedure for the deduction of pay were in conformity with the law.
.The Committee recalls that, according to its principles, the right to strike can be restricted in the case of public servants who exercise authority in the name of the State, but observes that in the present case the exercise of this right is permitted in practice. Under these circumstances, taking account of all the information provided in this case, and that the Supreme Court found that  the pay deductions imposed on the workers were made after establishing the identity of those who had actually stopped work and after the respondent party at its own initiative had rectified initial errors which had allegedly been made'  which means that the administrative procedure was conducted by the respondent party on the basis of technical criteria and with the correction at its own initiative of existing errors and that any alleged lack of reasonableness can be set aside, and that the Committee has indicated on numerous occasions that  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that the present case does not require further examination.",-1,2011,Chile
60,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Municipal Health Officials (CONFUSAM) dated  September . In a communication of  October , CONFUSAM sent additional information.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  October .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , CONFUSAM states that on  August  Dr Enzo Alejandro Zamorano Jorquera, a staff physician in the primary health-care system of La Granja commune in the city of Santiago, then serving as an officer of the Public Servants' Association of La Granja commune, affiliated to the Federation of Public Servants' Associations (FREMESA), itself an affiliate of CONFUSAM, was carrying out his normal duties in the La Granja clinic. On that occasion he was attending a patient as a matter of priority, and the patient died after medical treatment was provided (the complainant provides a detailed account of the treatment and of the stages in the treatment in which the trade union officer was involved). The complainant states that when Dr Zamorano realized that his patient had died, he immediately went to an assembly of his public servants' association informing them of the need to request the municipality of La Granja, through its highest authority, to conduct an inquiry into the death of the patient and investigate any persons who might be responsible. All of the above was accordingly reported to the mayor, and an investigation was opened a few days later.
.The complainant states that it should be added that the authorities of the commune had previously had problems with Dr Zamorano. The union officer had led a five-day strike in the commune some months earlier, demanding better conditions and equipment for primary health care in La Granja commune, and it had been publicly announced that there would be reprisals against him.
.The investigation was opened by Municipal Decree No.  of , and an official was appointed by the municipality to conduct it. He began immediately to gather evidence with the aim of blaming the patient s death on Dr Zamorano; accordingly, when the latter was questioned, he objected, stating that he did not know why he was being investigated and that he did not recognize the competence of the investigating body to investigate him, especially since it was he himself, through his public servants' association, who had prompted the investigation. The investigation was soon converted into administrative proceedings (under Act No. , the Administrative Statute for Municipal Officials) through Municipal Decree No. . In his defence, Dr Zamorano maintained that he was not responsible for the patient s death, as he had duly carried out the procedures required by the principles of medical practice (lex artis) and that the cause of death lay in inadequate coordination and the lack of medical equipment and hospital resources, as well as the delay in bringing in the patient and the failure of the ambulances to respond to the call made not less than four hours before the patient s death. Evidence was also requested in support of Dr Zamorano s innocence, in both testimonial and documentary form.
.The complainant states that the outcome of the process described above, which was monitored by the legal committee of CONFUSAM, was completely futile since the investigating body, instead of abiding by the principle of objectivity laid down in the Statute under Act No. , proceeded directly to gather only evidence inculpating Dr Zamorano, concluding that the penalty warranted in this case was nothing other than dismissal. Accordingly, an appeal was lodged with the mayor, requesting that, in the light of the full context provided by the facts and the evidence, as well as new evidence that might be submitted, the penalty should at least be reduced. CONFUSAM essentially maintained that responsibility for the patient s death could not be laid on only one person, given that the irregularities that had occurred were numerous and widespread; this was of course rejected by the authority, which upheld the dismissal of union officer Dr Zamorano.
.The complainant states that, represented by the trade union s current president, and in accordance with the same Statute enacted by Act No. , it filed an application for reconsideration with the Office of the Comptroller-General (CGR), maintaining the legal argument to the effect that Dr Zamorano was innocent of the patient s death, which was in fact due to the extremely poor conditions prevailing in the municipal primary health-care system in Chile. It is not possible in practice to treat illnesses requiring more complex care, so that disruptions such as the one found to have occurred when no ambulances were available, causing a delay in bringing the patient in to the local emergency room, result in the regrettable death of a patient. In fact, in the specific case at issue, Dr Zamorano was the only person who took the initiative to register a formal complaint. The decision of the CGR, which upheld the municipality s decision to dismiss Dr Zamorano, was issued in report No.  of  December , which states in its conclusions that Dr Zamorano  violated the principle of administrative integrity in placing private interest above the general interest when he left the service without medical staff, preferring to carry out his trade union activities'  The complainant considers that the following points should be clarified: () the principle of administrative integrity is laid down in the Statute enacted by Act No.  in section (g), serious violation of this provision being the only general case justifying application of the penalty of dismissal set out in section () of the Administrative Statute for Municipal Officials; () administrative integrity is defined in Act No.  (Act on administrative integrity), section , as follows:  consists of unimpeachable official conduct and honest and loyal performance of the office or duty, placing the public interest above private interest'  which leaves ample scope for the authorities to deem a serious violation of this provision any conduct diverging from the adjectives used in this section:  unimpeachable'   honest'   loyal'   placing ... above'  in fact, according to CONFUSAM, leaving aside the prejudice on the part of the authority, Dr Zamorano s conduct largely exceeds these standards, as he has devoted over  years to the service of the community, displaying remarkable commitment in the performance of his primary health-care duties; and () the ruling of the CGR constitutes a precedent that is detrimental to the development of trade union activity, indicating as it does that such activity is motivated by the private interest of the officer and denying its nature as the representation of colleagues in the workplace or occupation.
.Moreover, CONFUSAM considers it superficial to validate proceedings lasting over two years for the dismissal of Dr Zamorano, given that such proceedings did not meet the time limits set in the Statute itself. It adds that, in order to obtain validation of its arguments by a higher judicial body, it filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice against the decision handed down by the San Miguel Court of Appeal. On  June  the Supreme Court ruled that:  The judgment of  May last, contained on page , is upheld.' According to CONFUSAM, the outcome largely violates the principles of freedom of association.
.In its communication of  October , the complainant states that as a result of the national strike called by the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) on  and  August , the year in which CONFUSAM became an affiliate, municipal primary health-care officials were subjected to harassment and provocation by the Minister of Health. That official, to whom the system is technically subordinate, went to the Pablo Neruda Clinic in Lo Prado commune, in the city of Santiago, with a press team to cover the situation with regard to the work stoppage. The complainant adds that, noting that a state of relative normality had been maintained thanks to proper coordination between the officials and service users, he remained there until he saw a group of workers preparing to march towards the city centre in support of the national strike, as planned in the strike call. He then proceeded to get their attention in front of the cameras, as if he were their direct supervisor or a private employer angrily upbraiding his employees. That provoked a brief but vigorous reaction among the public servants, who publicly questioned him, highlighting inconsistencies in his speech and his poor performance at the head of his ministry, which eventually turned into a demonstration in which he was asked to leave the premises, as his presence was disrupting the community.
.The complainant adds that, as a result, the Minister himself ordered deductions from the wages of many officials of the municipal primary health-care system. In",-1,2011,Chile
61,"his view, agreement had been reached between the trade union and the public administration concerned on sectoral improvements that involved a commitment by CONFUSAM to refrain from further stoppages, which is wrong on two accounts: (i) the agreement did refer to sectoral issues and sought an understanding in that regard, but of course did not include a permanent limitation on the collective will with respect to putting forward demands on labour and wage conditions throughout the public sector, since that did not fall within the remit of this administration but came under that of the central executive branch, specifically the Ministry of Finance; and (ii) the agreement was not implemented by the authority concerned, making it necessary to file a complaint with the CGR, which unfortunately assigned it the force of a mere declaration, jeopardizing the credibility of future agreements between the parties, given that it was the authority itself that had failed to abide by its commitments.
.According to the complainant, the deductions were applied differently to the various municipalities, depending on how close the municipal administration was to the current Government and the Ministry of Health, making it necessary for CONFUSAM and other trade unions in the health sector and the public sector in general to file appeals for protection in an attempt to prevent them. The complainant states that the appeals yielded two results: (a) in the sector covered by CONFUSAM, the deductions were cancelled in most of the country s municipalities; and (b) in the other sectors the matter was resolved through rulings handed down by the Supreme Court, which in April this year set out its doctrine with regard to deductions in strikes.
.The doctrine of the Supreme Court, contained in Appeal Rulings in applications for protection of the Supreme Court of Justice, Nos  and , of , is somewhat more complex than the conclusion reached by the Government, and the Ministries of Health and Labour in particular. It criticizes the penalties as inappropriate, not having been preceded by the disciplinary procedures prescribed by law, and also on substantive grounds, as they were wrongly assigned.
.The complainant adds that the Ministry has recently attempted to hold up a process of nationwide strike action in defence of public health intended to push for the implementation of the Protocol of Agreement signed with that department, by intimidating the President of the Centro Occidente Federation of CONFUSAM and member of the CUT National Council, Dr Esteban Maturana. The Ministry has taken numerous measures against the union officer: telephone threats to hold him publicly responsible for the results of the strike; statements denigrating him in the media to the point of insulting him; and threats made inside the National Congress building in Valparaiso.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states, in regard to the allegations of dismissal of Dr Enzo Alejandro Zamorano Jorquera, staff primary health-care physician in La Granja and union officer of the Public Servants' Association of that commune, that it requested the mayor of La Granja municipality to send his observations on the subject, and that the latter reported that he had ordered a summary investigation to determine possible administrative responsibility of officials in connection with the death of a patient. The investigation was subsequently converted into administrative proceedings, which established the responsibility of Dr Enzo Zamorano Jorquera (the Government provides information on the medical treatment ordered by the union officer for the patient). The Government states that the mayor of La Granja reported further that the investigation had found that Dr Zamorano bore administrative responsibility and had concluded that he had provided inadequate medical care, failing to carry out the appropriate technical steps in treating the patient, despite the existence of clear and previously established rules which he should have applied in such situations. It also stated that the investigation had been carried out by an investigating official; that Dr Zamorano had replied to the charges and had been able to give evidence; that all of the applicable remedies had been sought (appeal to the mayor requesting reconsideration and filing of a complaint of illegality with the CGR); and that the dismissal took effect once the CGR had confirmed the measure (indicating that the penalty applied was duly proportionate to the acts under investigation).
.Despite the above, Dr Zamorano, with the support of CONFUSAM, filed an appeal for protection against the mayor of La Granja with the San Miguel Court of Appeal (Case No. -). Although the court rejected the suit, the plaintiffs subsequently appealed that decision in the Supreme Court ' Case No. / ' which unanimously upheld the decision handed down by the Court of Appeal.
.Lastly, the Government reports that the disciplinary measure of dismissal was prompted by, and based on, his capacity as physician treating a patient in the La Granja clinic, and was in no way related to his capacity as officer of a municipal association. Moreover, the acts were sufficiently serious as to convince not only the investigating official and the CGR, but also the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.
.As regards the new allegations of CONFUSAM referring to alleged harassment and provocation by the Minister of Health and objecting to pay deductions as a result of a work stoppage, the Government states that the Ministry of Health of Chile submitted the following arguments of fact and law concerning the right to strike and collective bargaining:' Act No.  on the general principles of state administration provides in section  that  public services are administrative bodies tasked with meeting collective needs, in a regular and continuous manner ...' ' officials of the primary health-care system have the legal status of public servants, and are therefore covered by Act No.  on the Administrative Statute, which provides in paragraph  (prohibitions) of section (i) that  to organize and belong to trade unions in the state administration; to lead, call or participate in strikes, or suspension or stoppages of work, whether total or partial, in unduly detaining persons or property, and in other acts disrupting the normal functioning of the bodies engaged in the administration of the State' ' Act No.  on the health authority provides in section  that  the Ministry of Health shall design, decide and supervise health-care policies. Accordingly, its tasks shall include ... : () managing the health sector; ... () ensuring effective coordination of the health-care networks at all levels' ' by virtue of the principle of continuity of public service and in view of the conflict between the right to freedom of expression (given that strikes are illegal in the public system) and the provision of health-care services, the role of the responsible Ministry is to guarantee the right to universal, timely and quality access of the public to health services, in order to avoid unnecessary risks causing irreparable damage or death, availing itself to that end of the powers vested in it by law;' without prejudice to the foregoing, CONFUSAM engaged in several working parties with the Ministry of Health, to the extent that, on  October , an agreement was signed between the parties referred to above and the Chilean Association of Municipalities.
.The Government states that, in accordance with the principle enshrined in the last indent of paragraph  of article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic, which provides that  state and municipal officials shall not have the right to strike. The same applies to persons who work in corporations or enterprises, irrespective of their nature, purpose or function, which provide public utility services or services the stoppage of which would cause serious damage to public health, the national economy, public supplies or national security'  it is clear that the Chilean Constitution does not allow public servants ' including those working in public hospitals ' to go on strike. What is more, the officials of the primary health-care system have the legal status of public servants, and are therefore covered by Act No.  on the Administrative Statute, article (i) of which, in paragraph , on prohibitions, provides as follows:  To organize and belong to trade unions in the state administration; to lead, call or participate in strikes, or suspension or stoppages of work, whether total or partial, in unduly detaining persons or property, and in other acts disrupting the normal functioning of the bodies engaged in the administration of the State.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In line with the above, the principle of legality enshrined in articles  and  of the Political Constitution of the Republic, and the provisions of section () of Act No. , the Constitutional Organic Act establishing the general principles of the state administration, and section (a) of the Administrative Statute lead to the conclusion that failing to perform one s duties in a constant and regular manner during working hours ' without having obtained the necessary leave or having been excused by management ' could constitute breach of the duties of efficiency, effectiveness and legality, and even affect the principle of",-1,2011,Chile
62,"administrative integrity laid down in the legislation.
.As regards the regulatory framework and the deductions applied in respect of the work stoppages, it should be recalled that the right to remuneration is laid down in section  of the Administrative Statute, and is based on the effective performance by the official of the services for which he or she was appointed. In addition, section  of the Statute provides as follows:  No remuneration shall be received for periods of time not actually worked, with the exception of holidays or leave with pay provided for in this Statute, preventive suspension referred to in section , unforeseen events or force majeure. Periods not actually worked by employees shall be deducted monthly by the pay staff, at the written request of the immediate supervisor, provided that the amount of remuneration deducted per day, per half day or per hour shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the monthly remuneration by ,  and , respectively ...'  This makes it clear that the legislation authorizes deductions from remuneration, provided that the prescribed requirements are met.
.The Government concludes that there has been no anti-union act or violation of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and , since the authorities of the Ministry of Health acted in accordance with the law, referring the matter to the jurisdictional bodies provided for by national legislation, which handed down their decisions, which are in conformity with the principles stated by the Committee on Freedom of Association in that regard.
.The Committee observes in the present case that the complainant: () objects to the dismissal of an officer of the Public Servants' Association of the commune of La Granja, Dr Enzo Alejandro Zamorano Jorquera, a primary health-care physician of the commune of La Granja; and () alleges acts of harassment by the Minister of Health against officials of the municipal primary health-care system of Chile in the context of the national strike called by the CUT for  and  August , and through intimidation of the President of the Centro Occidente Federation of CONFUSAM in an attempt to delay another strike; and that that authority ordered deductions from the remuneration of the officials who participated in the national strike (according to the complainant, the deductions were applied differently to the various municipalities and the matter was referred to the courts, which, in the sector covered by CONFUSAM, cancelled the deductions in most of the municipalities, while in other sectors the matter was resolved through two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice).
.With regard to the allegation concerning the dismissal of an officer of the Public Servants' Association of the commune of La Granja, Dr Enzo Alejandro Zamorano Jorquera, a primary health-care physician of the commune of La Granja, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the mayor of La Granja municipality ordered a summary investigation in order to determine the possible administrative responsibility of officials in connection with the death of a patient; the investigation was subsequently converted into administrative proceedings, which established the administrative responsibility of Dr Zamorano and found that inadequate care was provided by the doctor; () the investigation was carried out by an investigating official, Dr Zamorano replied to the charges and was able to give evidence, and all of the applicable remedies were subsequently sought (appeal to the mayor requesting reconsideration and filing of a complaint of illegality with the CGR; () the dismissal took effect once the CGR had confirmed the measure (indicating that the penalty applied was duly proportionate to the acts under investigation); and () Dr Zamorano, with the support of CONFUSAM, filed an appeal for protection against the mayor of La Granja with the San Miguel Court of Appeal, which rejected the suit; an appeal was lodged against the decision with the Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld the decision handed down by the Court of Appeal. In the light of all of this information, and observing that the union officer s dismissal was related to inappropriate professional conduct, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegations concerning harassment by the Minister of Health against officials of the municipal primary health-care system of Chile in the context of a national strike called by the CUT for  and  August  and through intimidation against the President of the Centro Occidente Federation of CONFUSAM in an attempt to delay another strike, and that that authority ordered deductions from the remuneration of the officials who participated in the national strike (according to the complainant, the deductions were applied differently to the various municipalities and the matter was referred to the courts, which cancelled the deductions in most of the municipalities), the Committee notes that the Government states that the Ministry of Health reported the following: () by virtue of the principle of continuity of public service, and in view of the conflict between the right to freedom of expression (given that strikes are illegal in the public system) and the provision of health-care services, the role of the responsible Ministry is to guarantee the right to universal, timely and quality access of the public to health services, in order to avoid unnecessary risks causing irreparable damage or death, availing itself to that end of the powers vested in it by law; and () without prejudice to the foregoing, CONFUSAM engaged in several working parties with the Ministry of Health, to the extent that, on  October , an agreement was signed between the parties referred to above with the Chilean Association of Municipalities.
.The Committee notes further that the Government states that: () in accordance with the principle enshrined in the last indent of paragraph  of article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic, public servants ' including those working in public hospitals ' are not allowed to strike; () the officials of the primary health-care system have the legal status of public servants, and are therefore covered by Act No.  on the Administrative Statute, section (i) of which, in paragraph , on prohibitions, provides as follows:  to organize and belong to trade unions in the state administration; to lead, call or participate in strikes, or suspension or stoppages of work, whether total or partial, in unduly detaining persons or property, or in other acts disrupting the normal functioning of the bodies engaged in the administration of the State'  () the principle of legality enshrined in articles  and  of the Political Constitution of the Republic, and the provisions of section () of Act No. , the Constitutional Organic Act establishing the general principles of the state administration, and section (a) of the Administrative Statute, lead to the conclusion that failing to perform one s duties in a constant and regular manner during working hours ' without having obtained the necessary leave or having been excused by management ' could constitute breach of the duties of efficiency, effectiveness and legality, and even affect the principle of administrative integrity laid down in the legislation; () as regards the deductions applied in respect of the work stoppages, it should be recalled that the right to remuneration is laid down in section  of the Administrative Statute, and is based on the effective performance by the official of the services for which he was appointed, and the legislation authorizes deductions from remuneration, provided that the prescribed requirements are met; and () there has been no anti-union act or violation of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and .
.In this regard, the Committee would like to point out, firstly, concerning the Government s statement that officials of the primary health-care system are prohibited from organizing and belonging to trade unions in the state administration, that, under the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , health sector officials should have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing for the promotion and defence of workers' interests, without previous authorization, as this is a fundamental right which should be enjoyed by all workers, without distinction whatsoever, including hospital personnel [see Digest of the decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. While it observes that in practice there are trade union organizations (such as the complainant) of health sector officials, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the legislation in order to guarantee full respect of the provisions of Article  of Convention No. .
.As regards the exercise of the right to strike of public servants (including those in the health sector), the Committee recalls that it has emphasized on many occasions that this right may be restricted or prohibited in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State, or in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) [see Digest,",-1,2011,Chile
63,"op. cit., para. ]. However, the Committee also emphasized that  in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, restrictions on the right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. While it observes that the Government states that health sector workers do not enjoy the right to strike ' although in practice it would appear that they engage in collective bargaining (the Government refers, for example, to a collective agreement concluded with the complainant) and carry out protest actions ' the Committee requests the Government to ensure respect of this principle concerning compensatory mechanisms where the right to strike is prohibited and to take steps to ensure that its legislation is in conformity with the principles referred to above.
.Lastly, as regards the alleged deductions from the remuneration of officials who participated in a national strike, the Committee ' while noting that, according to the complainant, they were cancelled in some municipalities, while in others the matter was resolved through Supreme Court rulings ' recalls the principle that  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the legislation in order to guarantee that health sector officials expressly enjoy the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing for the promotion and defence of the workers' interests, without previous authorization and to ensure that its legislation is in conformity with the principles mentioned in its conclusions.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect of the principle referred to above concerning compensatory mechanisms where the right to strike is prohibited.",2,2011,Chile
64,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its November  meeting, after having examined the allegations concerning the non renewal of the contracts of workers affiliated with ANFUSEGG and FENAMINSA, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee urges the Government to reply, without delay, to the allegations made by ANFUSEGG concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract from the Ministry for being members of ANFUSEGG and for participating in normal trade union activities, and to those made by FENAMINSA concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract, some of whom had served for over  years, for being members of the trade union organization.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that, as regards the allegations made by FENAMINSA, the Ministry of the Interior and Public Safety sent its observations informing the Committee that it is necessary to bear in mind that, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Administrative Statute (Act No. ), fixed-term posts are temporary in nature and that article  of the same text provides that the duration of fixed-term contracts shall not exceed  December each year. According to the ruling of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, public servants employed on a fixed-term contract cannot claim ownership of the post they occupy, unlike officially appointed public servants. Persons occupying fixed-term posts may be dismissed in two ways: firstly, by not renewing their contracts before  December each year; and, secondly, by terminating their contract early by means of an administrative act, which will only be effective if the respective act of appointment included the formula  as long as their services are necessary'  The posts of the persons whose contracts were not renewed were removed in keeping with the law, which was known to those persons because of the presumption of knowledge of the law mentioned in article  of the Civil Code and because of the nature of their appointment, of which, as public servants, they could not have been unaware. Furthermore, the Government supports the actions of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Safety and the ruling handed down on  July  by the Court of Appeal of Santiago, which rejects the appeal for protection filed by FENAMINSA against the Ministry. It also supports the ruling handed down by the Supreme Court of Chile on  December  in favour of the legality of the  early termination' of the fixed-term contracts in the public sector.
.The Ministry of the Interior and Public Safety states that it aligned itself with the laws in force and with the legal and administrative jurisprudence in that area, which has led both the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic and the courts to rule in favour of its actions. The Ministry adds that there are no grounds to support the statement of the complainant organization to the effect that the dismissal of the workers employed on a fixed-term contract was motivated by their affiliation with that organization or by their political ideology, particularly since it has not even been proven that all or at least the majority of the dismissed public servants were associated with the trade union organization. The Ministry also points out that the complainant organization is entitled to make use of all the powers conferred upon it by the legal system to benefit its members and that the complainant organization has taken representative action on behalf of those persons on its own initiative, despite the fact that the Ministry has done nothing to impede their activities.
.As regards the allegations made by ANFUSEGG, the Government attaches the observations of the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government, which indicate that public servants on both regular and fixed-term contracts are affiliated with the organization and that  of the  public servants thought to be currently employed by the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government are members thereof. The Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government adds that it has fully respected the provisions of article  of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to join a union in the manner provided for in the law regulating associations of public servants employed by the State administration, and that ANFUSEGG has been functioning normally from  March  to the present day and that it has enjoyed the full support of the authorities in that endeavour. The Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government indicates that, to date, no complaint has been filed with the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic or with the courts regarding a violation of the right to join a union by the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government. Lastly, the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government points out that the dismissals of public servants carried out from March  to the present day, referred to by ANFUSEGG, can be attributed to the end of their period of employment having been reached, to the needs of the service and to voluntary resignations, but cannot in any way be attributed to their membership of the trade union organization or to their participation in normal trade union activities.
.Lastly, the Government states that reading the complaint and the information provided by both State departments is not sufficient to determine whether or not Convention No.  has been violated. The dismissals in question, in both cases, were carried out in strict accordance with constitutional and legal norms, the international conventions in force, and with the jurisprudence of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic and that of the courts of appeal and the Supreme Court.
.The Committee recalls that when it examined this case at its November  meeting, it requested the Government to send without delay its observations on the allegations made by ANFUSEGG concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on fixed-term or fee contracts from the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government for being members of ANFUSEGG and for participating in normal trade union activities, and by FENAMINSA concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract, some of whom had served for over  years, for being members of the trade union organization [see th Report, para. )].
.As regards the allegations concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on fixed-term or fee contracts from the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government for being members of ANFUSEGG and for participating in normal trade union activities, the Committee takes note of the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government s statement to the effect that: () it has fully respected the provisions of article  of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to join a union in the manner provided for in the law regulating associations of public servants employed by the State administration; () ANFUSEGG has been functioning normally from  March  to the present day and that it has enjoyed the full support of the authorities in that endeavour; () the dismissal of public servants carried out from March  to the present day, referred to by ANFUSEGG, can be attributed to the end of their period of employment having been reached, to the needs of the service and to voluntary resignations, but cannot in any way be attributed to their membership of the trade union organization or to their participation in normal trade union activities; and () to date, no complaint has been filed with the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic or with the courts regarding a violation of the right to join a union by the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government.

In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The Committee recalls that it does not have the mandate and will not pronounce itself with respect to the advisability of recourse to fixed-term or indefinite contracts. Nevertheless, the Committee wishes to draw to attention that, in certain circumstances, the renewal of fixed-term contracts for several years may affect the exercise of trade union rights. However, this case does not raise this problem.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that the present case does not call for further examination.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the National Association of University Professionals of the Labour Directorate (APU), the National Association of Public Servants (ANEF), as well as in communications from the National Federation of Public Servant Associations of the Ministry of the Interior and related services (FENAMINSA) and the National Association of Public Servants of the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government (ANFUSEGG) dated  June and  August  respectively. FENAMINSA sent additional information in a communication dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , APU states that it is an association of public servants who are university professionals. The APU adds that it is affiliated with ANEF and the Amalgamated Workers' Union of Chile (CUT) and that it is lodging a formal complaint against the Government of Chile for its violation of the standards and principles set out in Convention No.  of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which protect and promote the right of public servants to organize and to freedom of association, on the grounds detailed below.
.The complainant explains that the incumbent President of the Republic took office on  March . During his campaign and at a meeting with ANEF, he promised that, once he had been sworn in as the highest-ranking magistrate of the State, he would not dismiss any public servant and that he would respect labour stability and the rights conferred on public servants by the laws currently in force.
.The APU alleges that, despite the promises made by the President of the Republic and with or without his approval, the authority of the Labour Directorate proceeded to implement policies that resulted in the dismissal of a number of public servants and in pay cuts for others, as well as policies that violated the rights of the leaders of public servant associations and, in particular, those of the leaders of APU. This occurred as the result of acts that can only be described as decisions taken by the authority in question without so much as an unsatisfactory performance evaluation to justify them and with no regard for the norms enshrining freedom of association.
.As regards the acts committed against the leaders of APU, the complainant states that Mr Fernando Hidalgo Rojas, the national treasurer of APU, was the successful candidate in an internal recruitment process, which was announced in Circular No.  of  December , and took up his post as Chief of the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares, Seventh Region of Maule, on  April . Subsequently, in Circular No.  of  August , the Labour Directorate called for a new process for recruiting labour inspectors, including inspectors for the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares. The APU considers that this act expressly violated Act No. , which provides that  leaders shall not be transferred from the place or post they occupy without their written consent'  which was not respected in this case. The complainant states that the acts committed against the national leader constituted a flagrant violation of an express norm. According to APU, this act was committed for the sole and specific purpose of removing the leader from his post without any grounds to justify such an act. In the light of this fact, APU proceeded to inform the authority in question that such an act violated trade union immunity and constituted an act of anti-union discrimination. The APU highlights that it publicly denounced this act, which forced the authority to overturn its decision.
.However, the complainant adds that a new act was committed against another national leader of APU on  March . Indeed, the authority in question, without grounds related to her qualifications and/or of a disciplinary nature, proceeded to remove Ms Elena Creus Castro, the incumbent national president of APU, from her post while she was on legal leave. Therefore, this act was carried out without prior consultation and on the basis of a fait accompli.
.The complainants state that both acts have infringed and continue to infringe the rights of the national leaders of APU and that they have been carried out against the rule of law. The complainants argue that such acts have a basis in the instructions of the President of the Republic, who, through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, has ordered the internal restructuring of the Labour Directorate and, in particular, of the Labour Inspection Department, where Ms Creus Castro had served as Chief of the Legal Unit since , during which time she maintained an exemplary record and never received any complaints regarding her performance. According to APU, the argument put forward by the authority to justify this decision has no basis in the Administrative Statute regulating public servants (Act No. ) and, in addition, violates Act No. , which was promulgated on  February  and which regulates associations of public servants employed by the Government. The relevant section of the Act provides as follows:Section . Directors of public servant associations shall enjoy trade union immunity, in other words, they shall be protected from dismissal from the date of their election until six months after their resignation, provided that their resignation does not occur as a result of censure by the assembly of the association in question or of formal removal from office as a disciplinary measure authorized by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic. Similarly, immunity shall not apply in the case of the dissolution of an association, when that dissolution is the result of the application of section , paragraphs (c) and (e), or of factors provided for in the internal regulations, provided that, in the latter case, the factors in question attribute culpable or malicious conduct to the directors of that association. Moreover, during the period referred to in the previous paragraph, leaders shall not be transferred from the place or post they occupy without their written consent. Similarly, they shall not be subject to annual assessments during that period unless such an assessment is expressly requested by the leader. If no such request is made, the most recent assessment shall apply for all legal purposes.
.The complainant states that the public body responsible for ensuring compliance with labour legislation, which includes these norms, and for remedying violations of trade union immunity by imposing fines on offenders and/or bringing perpetrators of acts undermining freedom of association before the national courts, as",-1,2011,Chile
66,"required by the Labour Code, has no qualms about carrying out the same acts, which, as a public service, it is required by law to remedy, against the leaders of APU, thereby setting a harmful precedent for workers' organizations in the country. The APU decided to bring the Labour Directorate before the labour courts for violating fundamental rights (acts of anti-union discrimination and the dignity of the persons involved). Currently, the trial is at the stage of discussion. The complainant believes that, by carrying out the aforementioned acts, the authority of the Labour Directorate attempted to deny the legitimacy of this public servant organization, and, in particular, that of its national leaders, by failing to provide the protection required by law, which constitutes a violation of the standards set out in ILO Convention No.  and of the law regulating its functioning.
.The APU states that, according to the aforementioned norms, the National Labour Director, together with her executive board, has violated Act No. , which regulates the functioning of public servant associations, and has disregarded and violated the standards set out in ILO Convention No.  by affording trade union activities inadequate protection, by disregarding the trade union immunity of its leaders, and by removing Ms Elena Creus Castro, the incumbent national president, from her post by means of an act that was arbitrary and had no basis in law. Therefore, this constituted a patent and flagrant act of anti-union discrimination against Ms Creus Castro and the organization. The APU believes that the fact that the State of Chile, under Supreme Decree No.  of  September , promulgated ILO Convention No.  as a law of the Republic, which had previously been adopted by the National Congress on  April , makes the facts and acts described in the preceding paragraphs all the more serious. The fact that the Convention was fully incorporated into Chilean domestic legislation on  July  makes these acts difficult to comprehend since they originated from the highest authority of the national public service, responsible for ensuring compliance with the law and for affording the principles of freedom of association special protection. The fact that Chile ratified ILO Convention No.  also implies that, in keeping with article  of the Constitution, the Convention enjoys constitutional standing, which means that the text in question prevails over domestic legislation, which, incidentally, includes the Administrative Statute regulating public servants (Act No. ).
.Thus, the state authorities are obliged to comply with domestic legislation, given that any failure to do so would constitute a violation of the principle of legality set out in articles  and  of the Constitution, in accordance with section  of the Constitutional Act establishing the General Principles of the State Administration (Act No. ). The APU adds that, under Act No. , which was passed in , a labour protection procedure was incorporated into domestic labour legislation. This procedure provides for the drafting of new sections of the Labour Code, namely sections  and , which refer to the violation of fundamental rights, such as anti-union discrimination, which are not mentioned in the Administrative Statute regulating public servants (Act No. ). Section  expressly provides that if the Labour Inspectorate, acting within its area of competence and without prejudice to its regulatory powers, learns of a violation of fundamental rights, it shall refer such an act to the competent court. From this, it may be deduced that the Labour Inspectorate is the body required by law to report any violation of the fundamental rights enshrined in ILO Convention No.  and in other normative instruments, which makes the conduct of the Labour Directorate all the more serious.
.It is surprising that the Labour Directorate and other state bodies, including the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, have attempted to avoid the full force and implementation of ILO Convention No.  by arguing that no law regulating its implementation has been passed. These excuses are a contradiction in terms and are repugnant to the moral and legal conscience of those who believe that the rule of law is maintained by a public order based on labour law, the main objective of which is to promote respect for and to protect the rights that, in turn, protect trade union activities and leaders. The APU believes that the Government should recant, with immediate effect, all the administrative actions it has taken or may take in the future through the Labour Directorate, which infringe the rights of any trade union leader representing public servants employed by the Labour Directorate and, in particular, the acts infringing the rights of Ms Elena Creus Castro, the national president of APU, given that these acts violate the normative provisions of domestic law and the principles and standards set out in Articles  and  of ILO Convention No. .
.In its communication dated  August , ANFUSEGG, which is affiliated with ANEF, and through the latter, with the CUT, states that it is lodging a formal complaint against the Government of Chile for its violation of the standards and principles set out in ILO Convention No. , which protect and promote the right of public servants to organize and to freedom of association, on the grounds detailed below.
.The ANFUSEGG alleges that  public servants employed on fixed-term or fee contracts by various government services were dismissed from the Ministry between March and December , and during the first trimester of , without grounds other than their status as members of the organization, their participation in normal trade union activities and/or decisions taken by the authority in question, despite the total absence of any unsatisfactory performance evaluation to justify their dismissal.
.These dismissals affected public servants employed on a fixed-term contract. Despite their contracts being renewed every year, the public servants in question could be employed for two, four, five, ten,  or more years at a time. In other words, they perform permanent functions on behalf of the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of Government. They do not service specific programmes, nor are they involved in politics, as the authority claims. Moreover, they maintain an exemplary professional record and are highly qualified.
.According to ANFUSEGG, these dismissals were the result of the mere presumption that the public servants in question thought differently to the new Government when it came to power on  March . This attitude is ethically reprehensible and runs counter to the principles and standards of the ILO. These mass dismissals have been carried out against the rule of law, on the pretext that the services of the aforementioned public servants are no longer necessary or that their contract has expired, which is part of a subterfuge contained in the Administrative Statute regulating public servants (Act No. ) but which, in reality, entails acts that may be classed as an  abuse of rights' 
.The complainants state that the grounds for dismissal,  as long as their services are necessary'  which have been invoked in the case of the trade union members, are not referred to anywhere in the relevant legal statutes. They add that attempts to seek remedies to safeguard their constitutional rights before the national courts of appeal, in the face of their dismissal, have proven futile, as inevitably, despite the fact that the courts have ruled in favour of the public servants and against the authority in more than  per cent of cases, the Third Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has consistently overturned those rulings, thereby validating and legitimizing dismissals with an overt political bias.
.In its communication dated  August , FENAMINSA, which is affiliated with ANEF and, through the latter, with CUT, alleges that the Ministry of the Interior, which is a branch of the Government, despite the promises made by the President of the Republic and with or without his approval, proceeded to dismiss  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract by the Ministry and related services between March and December  and during the first trimester of , without grounds other than their status as members of the organization, their participation in normal trade union activities and/or decisions taken by the authority in question, despite the total absence of any unsatisfactory performance evaluation to justify their dismissal.
.The complainant also adds that these dismissals affected public servants employed on a fixed-term contract. Despite their contracts being renewed every year, the public servants in question could be employed for two, four, five, ten,  or more years at a time. In other words, they perform permanent functions on behalf of the Ministry. They do not service specific programmes, nor are they involved in politics, as the authority claims. Moreover, they maintain an exemplary professional record and are highly qualified. These dismissals were the result of suspicions that the public servants in question thought differently to the new Government when it came to power on  March . This attitude is ethically reprehensible and runs counter to",-1,2011,Chile
67,"the principles and standards of the ILO. These mass dismissals have been carried out against the rule of law, on the pretext that the services of the aforementioned public servants are no longer necessary or that their contract has expired, which is part of a subterfuge contained in the Administrative Statute regulating public servants (Act No. ) but which, in reality, entails acts that may be classed as an  abuse of rights' 
.The grounds for dismissal,  as long as their services are necessary'  which have been invoked in the case of the trade union members, are not referred to anywhere in the relevant legal statutes, which only recognize  administrative malpractice'  which runs counter to the principle of legality governing administrative actions, and are endorsed by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, a regulatory body that is always sympathetic to the authority when it comes to denying the rights and dignity of public servants. In other cases, fixed-term contracts have not been renewed. For the most part, this affected public servants who were recruited or reinstated after the fall of the military dictatorship and during the early days of the first democratic Government. The complainants also add that attempts to seek remedies to safeguard their constitutional rights before the national courts of appeal, in the face of their dismissal, have proven futile, as inevitably, despite the fact that the courts have ruled in favour of the public servants and against the authority in more than  per cent of cases, the Supreme Court of Justice has consistently overturned those rulings, thereby validating and legitimizing dismissals with an overt political bias. Furthermore, the complainants add that, at the time of the filing of the complaint, the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic had not handed down a ruling on this formal complaint that invokes ILO Convention No.  and that, in accordance with the law, repudiates the acts of the authority, which are denounced. As indicated in the preceding paragraphs, the Convention is a law of the Republic and enjoys constitutional standing in accordance with article , paragraph  of the Constitution.
.The complainant adds that it should be noted that the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic issued, without comment or objection, the decree promulgating ILO Convention No.  as a law of the Republic, despite maintaining a complicit silence as regards its implementation until the date on which this formal complaint, which details the publicly known facts behind it, was lodged. For the complainant, the fact that the acts in question may be attributed to the President of the Republic (who promised to respect labour stability and the work of public servants) and to an individual belonging to the Ministry of the Interior who, regardless of the individual temporarily occupying the post, are required by the Constitution to respect and to promote compliance with the law, does nothing to attenuate the seriousness of the acts mentioned in the formal complaint. In fact, it makes them all the more serious. This is especially the case for laws referring to international treaties ratified by Chile that are in force, in accordance with article , paragraph  of the Constitution, and, consequently, to the need to respect the principle of legality set out in articles  and  of that text, in accordance with section  of the Constitutional Act establishing the General Principles of the State Administration (Act No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the Government provided the following information:
.The organization that has referred the present case to the Committee on Freedom of Association is one of the two public servant associations established under Act No. . The oldest and the most representative of the two is the National Association of Public Servants of Chile (ANFUNTCH), which was established in , while APU was established in . Both organizations function in total freedom and carry out all their trade union activities without restriction. In its communication, APU made the following allegations against the Chilean State: () that it violated the trade union immunity of the leader Mr Fernando Hidalgo Rojas when, in August , under the auspices of the authority in question, it called for a recruitment process to appoint labour inspectors to various offices throughout the country, including the office overseen by Mr Rojas, which the complainants consider to constitute a violation of section  of Act No. , which provides that leaders shall not be transferred from the place or post they occupy without their written consent; () that it violated the trade union immunity of Ms Elena Creus Castro when, under the auspices of the authority in question, it ordered the restructuring of the Labour Inspection Department of the Labour Directorate in March , which altered the structure of the Legal Unit to which Ms Creus Castro belonged, a decision that, according to the complainant, has no basis in the Administrative Statute in force and violates section  of Act No. ; and () that, through these alleged acts, it attempted to deny the legitimacy of APU and, in particular, that of its leaders, thereby violating domestic law and Articles  and  of ILO Convention No. .
.The Government adds that it should be noted that the context in which these allegations were made was defined by the rational introduction of a series of changes, new approaches and regulations by the new authority. It is common knowledge that the arrival of the new Government in  led to a natural change of administration in public institutions, including the Labour Directorate, which is a decentralized public service that comes under the authority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The activities of the Labour Directorate fall within an area that is particularly complex and subject to change, which is the area governed by labour standards, where the demands of users are increasingly diverse and pressing, not to mention growing and exacting. In this context, the need to adopt diverse and progressive measures aimed at equipping the institution to successfully meet internal and external demands, and to complete the tasks entrusted to it for the common good, has proven unavoidable. This has been the situation across various areas of the Labour Directorate over the last decade, since it first perceived the need to adapt to a variety of challenging situations, namely, labour reform, the introduction of new technology, changes in administrative procedure, procedural reform and the growth of the working population, etc.
.In this connection, the Government believes it should be noted that certain areas and levels of the institution have recently undergone change and reform in order to deal with new policies and challenges, which range from the appointment of new regional directors and of provincial and communal labour inspectors; the opening of new offices and an increase in field inspectors (fiscalizadores de terreno); to the closure, restructuring and creation of units within departments at the central level so that they can perform their functions in a more efficient, effective and coordinated manner, as required by the Constitutional Act establishing the General Principles of the State Administration (Act No. ). As regards the last point, the Labour Directorate, following the completion of the relevant studies and assessments, indeed called for changes, adjustments and streamlining measures not only within its regional and local bodies but also within the departmental structures at the central level. This was the context in which the authority made changes within the Administration and Finance Department, by appointing new chiefs, namely the Deputy Chief of the Department itself, the Chief of the Procurement Unit and the Chief of the Supply and Logistics Unit. Furthermore, a new chief was appointed to the Statistics Unit within the Department of Studies, and a new deputy chief to the Human Resources Department. In addition, the authority ordered the assimilation of the Data Processing Centre into the Personnel Unit and the closure of the Occupational Health Unit and the Training and Development Unit. However, as regards its operational lines, the Labour Directorate passed Exempt Resolution No.  of  March , which established and streamlined the new organizational and functional structure of the Legal Department; Exempt Resolution No.  of  January , which altered the structure of the Labour Relations Department and established the relevant units; and Exempt Resolution No.  of  March  concerning the Labour Inspection Department, which will be mentioned in detail in the following paragraphs. By way of an example, these resolutions provided for the establishment of the Legal Oversight Unit within the Legal Department, for the closure of the Pre-judicial Individual Conciliation Unit and for the transfer of the latter s functions, which are linked to the institution s outcome of conciliation, to the Labour Relations Department. In addition, these resolutions provided for the establishment of the Alternative Conflict Resolution and Social Dialogue Unit within the Labour Relations Department.
.As regards its lines of inspection, it should be noted that, during the first",-1,2011,Chile
68,"semester of , the Ministry of Labour and Social Security launched a process aimed at assessing and diagnosing the problems of the Labour Directorate, which notably involved the intervention of an external consultant. The process yielded  proposals containing short-, medium- and long-term measures aimed at optimizing and modernizing inspection procedures within the Directorate. These new policies governing labour services have truly re-engineered the current system to favour all users, be they workers, trade unions or employers. This re-engineering has been carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and with support and constant feedback from all the bodies involved.
.Therefore, it is clear that the series of adjustments carried out within the Labour Directorate, which is behind the complaint lodged by the organizations in question, may be attributed to global restructuring or to restructuring that addresses operating lines in the widest sense at the central, regional and provincial levels. These adjustments are therefore the result of organizational and functional decisions that are not aimed at any person in particular, much less at curtailing the trade union activities of the associations that exist within the institution.
.The Government states that Mr Fernando Hidalgo Rojas is a public servant employed on a regular contract. He is classed as a grade  inspector (fiscalizador) and was appointed as a grade  inspector (fiscalizador) on a fixed-term contract to the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares, Seventh Region of Maule, where he currently works as the Provincial Labour Inspector. He is a leader of APU and currently serves as the treasurer of the organization. Mr Hidalgo has worked for the institution for  years. He was initially employed as a grade  inspector (fiscalizador) on  June  under Resolution No.  of  May of the same year. After several appointments, including a promotion to a grade  inspector (fiscalizador) employed by the institution on a regular contract under Resolution No.  of  July , Mr Hidalgo was appointed as the Provincial Labour Inspector of Linares under Exempt Resolution No.  of  March , having successfully completed the recruitment process announced in Circular No.  of  December , which set out the criteria governing the recruitment of chiefs to the offices based in Calama, Choapa Illapel, San Antonio, Linares, Molina and Puerto Montt. Paragraph III of the aforementioned Circular, entitled Conditions governing posts, provides that:Having completed three years in the post, the Labour Director can decide to grant a three-year extension or to call for a new recruitment process. In order to take this decision, the Labour Director must be in possession of  reports: one report from the appropriate Regional Director, one from the Chief of the Labour Inspection Department, one from the Chief of the Labour Relations Department and one from the Chief of the Legal Department.
.By exercising her power to call for a new competition once the period of three years referred to in the aforementioned paragraph had elapsed, she proceeded to include the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares in the call for the competition, which was held by the national authority and announced in Circular No.  of  August , with a view to recruiting chiefs to the following Labour Inspectorates: the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Iquique, the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Pozo Almonte, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Antofagasta, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of San Felipe, the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Quilpue, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Concepcin, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of uble, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Arauco, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Punta Arenas, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Tierra del Fuego, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Valdivia, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of La Unin, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Arica, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Centro, the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Melipilla, the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Buin, the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Norte and the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Norte Chacabuco. However, it was noted that the decision to include the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares necessitated special criteria (namely, the four reports), which differed from the criteria for recruiting chiefs to the remaining Labour Inspectorates, mentioned in Circular No. . Subsequently, in an effort to streamline the criteria for recruiting chiefs through the competition and to avoid the candidates for the post at the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares having to satisfy criteria that candidates for the other Labour Inspectorates did not, a decision was taken to expressly exclude the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares from the recruitment process in Circular No.  of  September . Therefore, the post of Provincial Labour Inspector of Linares occupied by Mr Hidalgo Rojas was not affected in any way.
.The Government wishes to underline that in no way has the current administration violated or attempted to violate the trade union immunity of Mr Hidalgo Rojas who, to date, is performing his functions as the Provincial Labour Inspector of Linares without restriction, the very functions he falsely claims the authority to have infringed.
.As regards Ms Elena Creus Castro, she is the incumbent national president of APU and has been a leader of the organization since . She is a public servant employed on a regular contract and is classed as a grade  professional. She joined the Labour Directorate on  August  (between  January  and  October  she worked for the Social Security Service) and, since  October , she has been working for the Labour Inspection Department, where she currently works as a legal advisor. In that Department, Ms Creus was Chief of the Fine Control and Review Unit until , before being appointed as Chief of the Legal Unit, a post which she occupied until March  before beginning work as a legal advisor following the restructuring of the Labour Directorate and of her department in particular, which led to the closure of the Legal Unit. The reasons for this closure will be explained below. It should be noted that, under Resolution No.  of  October , the Fine Control and Review Unit to which Ms Creus belonged was closed following the transfer of its functions to a new unit (the User Services Unit), created under the same Resolution, causing the public servant to be appointed to the Legal Unit, also established under that Resolution, in spite of her status as a trade union leader at that time.
.As regards the closure of the Legal Unit, the Government highlights that Resolution No.  of  October  established the structure of the Labour Inspection Department (previously known in Spanish as the Departamento de Fiscalizacin), which included four operative units, namely the Legal Unit, the Management Unit, the Inspection Support and Assessment Unit and the User Services Unit. Over time, its functional structure was subject to a number of alterations, which included the Management Unit overseeing the activities of the Inspection Support and Assessment Unit until March . This also included specific tasks such as those overseen by what was then known as the Autonomous Inspection Unit, which had its own legal service. At the same time, the Legal Department gradually came to provide the technical support of a legal nature required for inspection activities, especially during the last four years, in keeping with the authority s desire to devise a strategy that was more cross-cutting in terms of the service s operational lines (legal and inspection lines as well as labour relations).
.As regards the assimilation of the Legal Unit, it should be noted that, under Resolution No. , it was composed of two public servants (lawyers) and their respective functions, which were to advise the Chief of the Legal Department on legal matters falling within their area of competence, especially on proposing criteria and approaches for issuing authorizations and resolutions; to assist the office of the Chief of the Legal Department; to study and disseminate administrative jurisprudence on operational lines in response to queries and to submit requests based on emerging needs to the Legal Department; to assist with external queries, complaints and requests submitted to the service, either directly or through government channels, by drafting appropriate replies.
.The arrival of the new Government led to the adoption of measures aimed at modernizing and optimizing the functioning of labour services which, in turn, necessitated a further restructuring of the Labour Inspection Department, which entailed the creation of new units and the closure of others from  March , including the Legal Unit. Following the closure of the Legal Unit, Ms Creus was appointed as a legal advisor within the Labour Inspection Department and was required to perform the following functions: to advise the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Labour Inspection Department, as well as the units it comprises, on legal matters falling within her area of competence and especially on proposing criteria and approaches for issuing authorizations and resolutions; to study and disseminate administrative jurisprudence in response to queries and to submit requests based on emerging needs to the Legal Department;",-1,2011,Chile
69,"to complete all tasks assigned to her by the Chief or Deputy Chief of the Labour Inspection Department that fall within her area of legal competence; whenever it is necessary, to advise the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Labour Inspection Department, as well as the chiefs of its units, on drafting legal documents to deal with external queries, complaints and requests submitted to the service, either directly or through government channels.
.As regards the new structure of the Labour Inspection Department, the Government has already explained that new approaches, needs and institutional challenges compelled the authority to restructure the Labour Directorate. Thus, following the creation of the User Services Unit referred to in the preceding paragraphs, the authority proceeded to establish and streamline a new organizational and functional structure for the Labour Inspection Department at the beginning of March , as provided for under Exempt Resolution No. . The Exempt Resolution established the structure of the Labour Inspection Department, which is composed of an executive board overseen by a chief and a deputy chief, and of the following five units: () the Plans and Programmes Unit; () the Electronic Fine Administration Unit; () the Instructions and Procedures Control Unit; () the Normative Oversight and Request Management Unit; and () the Labour Security and Health Unit. As stated in the text of the Exempt Resolution, its entry into force repealed any internal norms governing the composition of the Labour Inspection Department that ran counter to its new structure. It is in the context of the aforementioned changes that the appointment of Ms Creus as a legal advisor within the department should be considered.
.Lastly, as regards the aforementioned restructuring, it should be noted that Ms Creus took  days of annual leave from  January , returning to work on  March , when she was informed of the plans for the department by the Deputy Chief of the Labour Inspection Department, Mr Gabriel Ramrez. Following the announcement of Exempt Resolution No.  and, at the request of Ms Creus, the Chief of the Labour Inspection Department explained to her in detail the functions she was to perform within the new departmental structure, which, naturally, are similar to those she performed prior to the aforementioned changes.
.The Government states that, in Chile, the Labour Directorate has been the greatest defender of freedom of association in the different areas where it is exercised and has devised long-term and cross-cutting policies, as well as practical outcomes, with the aim of safeguarding the right of workers to establish organizations and enabling these organizations to function in keeping with the autonomy accorded to them by law. Moreover, over the last  years, the service has played an undeniable role in protecting the individual and collective rights of workers, especially following the labour reform provided for under Act No.  and the more recent procedural reform provided for under Act No. , which have paved the way for the effective recognition of fundamental rights in the labour sphere which, incidentally, include the right to freedom of association.
.In this context, the establishment and functioning of public servant organizations within the Labour Directorate is a totally natural process that ensures full respect for the autonomy of the two existing organizations, namely APU and ANFUNTCH. However, the present complaint would make more sense if the actions of the authority involved either restricting the normal trade union activities of Mr Hidalgo and Ms Creus or the functioning of the association within the Labour Directorate, be it at the central, regional or communal level. However, this is in no way the case. It is sufficient to note that, last May, APU reshuffled its executive board without impediments or restrictions, in total freedom and with the relevant facilities of the service at its disposal. Both public servants were free to participate in this process to the extent that Ms Creus was able to obtain the number of votes required to become the national president of the organization for the period ' , while Mr Hidalgo secured the post of national director for the same period.
.The Government states that, as is the case with all the leaders of the two associations operating within the Labour Directorate, Ms Creus, in her capacity as a leader and as a public servant at the central level, retains all her freedoms, rights, benefits and opportunities to fulfil her role as a representative, which can be verified both before and after the restructuring of the service. Thus, it is clear that her superiors are flexible in granting her trade union leave. She also enjoys unlimited personal, written, telephone and email access to public servants of different grades working at the central, regional, provincial and communal levels. The same applies to her relations with other associations and she enjoys constant access to the different authorities of the institution. Similarly, the authority does not restrict the trade union activities of Mr Hidalgo, a public servant appointed to the region of Maule, even when he has been appointed as the chief of a provincial office.
.It should also be noted that both associations, as well as their leaders, enjoy access to the email facilities of the Labour Directorate. Leaders are free to send any kind of communication to the service s generic inboxes, which ensures that any communication reaches every public servant in the country. This has been demonstrated over the last few weeks by the circulation of statements, meant for public disclosure, that openly criticize the Government through this institutional medium, as well as by exchanges of opinion concerning the restructuring of the Labour Directorate. Moreover, the associations and their leaders are still free to make use of other resources for their trade union activities, such as meeting rooms, telephones, wall calendars, links on the intranet site of the Labour Directorate, etc. without restriction.
.The allegation concerning the violation of freedom of association also lacks doctrinal evidence. No aspect of the freedom of association enjoyed by the association and the leaders in question has been affected in the slightest by the organizational and functional restructuring ordered by the Labour Directorate, which has already been described in detail in the preceding paragraphs. There is no debate as to the status of Mr Hidalgo and Ms Creus as trade union leaders, nor is any attempt being made to deny the applicability of section  of Act No.  in this case. However, at the same time, it should be noted that their right to freedom of association has not been curtailed in any way. Similarly, it should be noted that in no way does this case constitute a violation of ILO Convention No. .
.As regards Act No. , which regulates the functioning of public servant associations, and the binding jurisprudence of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, the Government states that since the legal framework in question is determined by provisions with a basis in administrative law, it is necessary to consider the jurisprudence of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic applicable to this case, in addition to the information contained in the preceding paragraphs. It should be noted that, by law and in accordance with the Constitution, the Labour Directorate, as a public service, is subject to the oversight of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, given that its rulings are legally binding upon the Government currently in power, as may be deduced from Act No.  and the relevant administrative jurisprudence.
.Section  of Act No. , which is invoked in the complaint, provides that:Directors of public servant associations shall enjoy trade union immunity, in other words, they shall be protected from dismissal from the date of their election until six months after their resignation, provided that their resignation does not occur as a result of censure by the assembly of the association in question or of formal removal from office as a disciplinary measure authorized by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic. Similarly, immunity shall not apply in the case of the dissolution of an association, when that dissolution is the result of the application of section , paragraphs (c) and (e), or of factors provided for in the internal regulations, provided that, in the latter case, the factors in question attribute culpable or malicious conduct to the directors of that association. Moreover, during the period referred to in the previous paragraph, leaders shall not be transferred from the place or post they occupy without their written consent. Similarly, they shall not be subject to annual assessments during that period unless such an assessment is expressly requested by the leader. If no such request is made, the most recent assessment shall apply for all legal purposes. Directors of public servant associations shall have the right to request information from the authorities of the relevant institution on issues and norms related to the objectives of the associations and to the rights and obligations of their members. The authorities of the institution shall receive",-1,2011,Chile
70,"leaders appropriately and provide them with the relevant information. Moreover, they shall have the right to request participation in the examination of policies concerning the rights and obligations of the personnel of the institution in question.
.The Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, harmonizing the remit of section , paragraph  with the provisions of section , paragraph  of the Constitutional Act establishing the General Principles of the State Administration (Act No. ) (which empowers chiefs to direct, organize and administer their service; to monitor it, to ensure compliance with its objectives and to oversee its management), stipulated in Decision Nos  of ,  of ,  of ,  of ,  of  and  of ,  of  and  of  that, while trade union leaders are protected by the immunity referred to in section  of Act No. , which guarantees their right not to be transferred from the place or post they occupy, this cannot, however, prevent the authority of the service in question from exercising its power to reform or restructure its offices when circumstances call for such an action, especially when this internal restructuring has a basis in section  of Act No. , which provides that authorities shall ensure the effective functioning of public services. In addition, Decision Nos  of ,  of  and  of  of the same regulatory body maintain that a post whose nomenclature has not been provided for in the law regulating the distribution of permanent staff, as in the case of Ms Creus, may be assigned or entrusted functions. These Decisions add that the cessation of the functions entrusted to a leader does not constitute a violation of the trade union immunity referred to in section  of Act No.  since it merely signals the end of a circumstantial situation defined by the needs of the institution.
.The Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic adds that the cessation of the functions entrusted to a leader does not constitute a violation of the trade union immunity referred to in section  when, according to this principle, the functions that leaders are entitled to retain are those attached to the post to which they have been appointed. The Government adds that the regulatory body has, in turn, pointed out that assigned or entrusted functions do not constitute a right that features in the patrimony of public servants who are assigned specific tasks but, in fact, constitute a necessary administrative measure that the authority must adopt in order for the relevant service to meet public or collective needs in a regular, uninterrupted and permanent manner. Lastly, as regards the case of Mr Hidalgo, it is difficult to see how the right he invokes (the right not to be transferred from the place or post he occupies without his consent) has been violated when, as has been explained, the functions assigned to him corresponded to those of the chief of office (the Provincial Labour Inspector of Linares) which, in this case, were already subject to review every three years; the same functions that, incidentally, he performs to date.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, APU and ANEF allege that since the current Government came to power on  March , the authority of the Labour Directorate proceeded to implement policies that violated the rights of the leaders of public servant associations, particularly those of the leaders of APU. They allege that: () in order to remove Mr Fernando Hidalgo Rojas, the national treasurer of APU, from his post, the authority of the Labour Directorate called for a new recruitment process to fill the post occupied by the leader, who was the successful candidate in an internal recruitment process (the complainants state that the authority only overturned its decision after they publicly denounced this act); and () Ms Elena Creus Castro, the national president of APU, was removed from her post while she was on legal leave. The Committee notes that (i) ANFUSEGG alleges that, between March  and the first trimester of ,  public servants employed on fixed-term or fee contracts were dismissed from the Ministry for being members of ANFUSEGG and for participating in normal trade union activities (according to the complainant, the Third Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice validated the dismissals); and (ii) FENAMINSA also alleges that, between March  and the first trimester of ,  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract were dismissed (some of whom had served for over  years) for being members of this trade union organization (according to the complainant, the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic and the Supreme Court of Justice validated these dismissals).
.As regards the allegations of APU and ANEF, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that: () the arrival of the new Government in  led to a natural change of administration in public institutions, including the Labour Directorate, which comes under the authority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and whose activities fall within an area that is particularly complex and subject to change; () in this context, the need to adopt diverse and progressive measures aimed at equipping the institution to successfully meet internal and external demands, and to complete the tasks entrusted to it for the common good, has proven unavoidable; () the Labour Directorate, following the completion of the relevant studies and assessments, called for changes, adjustments and streamlining measures, not only within its regional and local bodies but also within the departmental structures at the central level (whereby new chiefs were appointed); and () it is clear that the series of adjustments carried out within the Labour Directorate, which is behind the complaint lodged by the organizations in question, may be attributed to global restructuring or to restructuring that addresses operating lines in the widest sense at the central, regional and provincial levels. These adjustments are therefore the result of organizational and functional decisions that are not aimed at any person in particular, much less at curtailing the trade union activities of the associations that exist within the institution.
.As regards the allegation that a competition was called with the aim of removing the leader Mr Fernando Hidalgo Rojas from his post (a decision which was eventually overturned), the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that: () Mr Hidalgo has worked for the institution for  years and, under Exempt Resolution No.  of  March , was appointed as the Provincial Labour Inspector of Linares, having successfully completed the recruitment process announced in Circular No.  of  December , which set out the criteria governing the recruitment of chiefs for the offices based in Calama, Choapa Illapel, San Antonio, Linares, Molina and Puerto Montt; () paragraph III of the aforementioned Circular provides that  having completed three years in the post, the Labour Director can decide to grant a three-year extension or to call for a new recruitment process. In order to take this decision, the Labour Director must be in possession of four reports: one report from the appropriate Regional Director, one from the Chief of the Labour Inspection Department, one from the Chief of the Labour Relations Department and one from the Chief of the Legal Department; () by exercising her power to call for a new competition once the period of three years referred to in the aforementioned paragraph had elapsed, she proceeded to include the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares in the call for the competition, which was held by the national authority. However, it was noted that the decision to include the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares necessitated special criteria (namely, the four reports), which differed from the criteria for recruiting chiefs to the remaining Labour Inspectorates; () in an effort to streamline the criteria for recruiting chiefs, a decision was taken to expressly exclude the Chief of the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Linares. Therefore, the post occupied by Mr Hidalgo Rojas was not affected in any way; and () in no way has the current administration violated or attempted to violate the trade union immunity of the leader in question. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged removal of Ms Elena Creus Castro, the president of APU, from her post while she was on legal leave, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement to the effect that: () Ms Castro is a public servant employed on a regular contract who has been working for the Labour Inspection Department since  October , where she currently works as a legal advisor; () she was Chief of the Fine Control and Review Unit until , before being appointed as Chief of the Legal Unit, a post which she occupied until March  before beginning work as a legal advisor following the restructuring",2,2011,Chile
71,"of the Labour Directorate, which led to the closure of the Legal Unit; () under Resolution No.  of  October , the Fine Control and Review Unit to which Ms Creus belonged was closed following the transfer of its functions to a new unit created under the same Resolution, causing the public servant to be appointed to the Legal Unit in spite of her status as a trade union leader; and () following the closure of the Legal Unit, Ms Creus was appointed as a legal advisor within the Labour Inspection Department with functions similar to those she carried out prior to these changes. In the light of the information provided by the Government and given the fact that the public servant is still performing the functions she carried out prior to the aforementioned restructuring, which do not prevent her from carrying out her trade union activities, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.Lastly, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations made by ANFUSEGG concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on fixed-term or fee contracts from the Ministry for being members of ANFUSEGG and for participating in normal trade union activities, or to those made by FENAMINSA concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract, some of whom had served for over  years, for being members of the trade union organization. In these conditions, the Committee urges the Government to reply to those allegations without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to reply, without delay, to the allegations made by ANFUSEGG concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract from the Ministry for being members of ANFUSEGG and for participating in normal trade union activities, and to those made by FENAMINSA concerning the dismissal of  public servants employed on a fixed-term or fee contract, some of whom had served for over  years, for being members of the trade union organization.",-1,2011,Chile

.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , ANFDGAC indicates that it is a national organization of officials of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC), a unit of the Public Administration of Chile. It states that, in accordance with Act No. , the structure of ANFDGAC includes a national directorate and regional and provincial directorates, recognized under a labour inspectorate certificate of validity establishing and managing trade union activity in the DGAC. Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira and Mr Javier Norambuena Morales are, respectively, third national director and regional secretary of Concepcin, and national and regional secretary of the Punta Arenas branch, and Mr Dalivor Eterovic Daz and Mr Rodrigo Leficura Snchez are the regional directors of the Punta Arenas branch.
.The complainant alleges that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, through special resolution No.  of  March , adopted the first edition of the internal procedure known as PRO.DRH No.  on the recording of leave of the directors of the associations of officials of the DGAC, in accordance with Act No. . The complainant notes that the ANFDGAC repeatedly challenged the aviation authority s decision to restrict trade union immunities through the use of the abovementioned internal procedure, including through the following petitions: () a complaint appeal was submitted to the Director-General of Civil Aviation in ANFDGAC letter No. // dated  April ; () a complaint appeal was submitted to the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic in ANFDGAC letter No. // dated  May ; () opinion No.  dated  December  was issued by the Comptroller General of the Republic, which, in general terms, validated PRO.DRH No. ; and () an appeal for reconsideration was submitted to the Comptroller General of the Republic in ANFDGAC letter No. // dated  April . There has been no response to date.
.According to the complainant, Act No.  does not provide for setting down rules on the use of leave entitlement, yet senior management adopted measures to record respective leaves of absence. Indeed, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation published an internal procedure regulating union leave set out under Act No.  known as PRO.DRH No. , under sections .. and .. which state: ' ... Leave time is  hours per week for each director representing the association of officials of the DGAC at the respective regional level, and  hours per week for each association director at the national level.' ' ... Directors may exceed the allotted time in the event of duly verified summons by public officials.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.According to the complainant, the wording of the above points enabled the Director General of Civil Aviation to initiate two administrative procedures against the four above-cited ANFDGAC officials, as it enabled the aviation authority to convert the minimum leave limit under Act No.  into a maximum leave limit. In that regard, the complainant notes that, between  August and  September , Carriel Sur Airport in Concepcin was the subject of a special audit No. /, which stated that,  after examining the time sheets and staff shift schedules for the period from January to August , attached hereto, pertaining to AVSEC official Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira, member of the DGAC trade union, and third national director and regional secretary of Concepcin, it was determined that he had not met the legal monthly working hours and consequently, no deduction was made for the hours not worked during that period'  Furthermore:  The foregoing is in violation of article  of Act No.  (Administrative Statute) on the normal working hours for officials, which should be  hours a week; officials must thus perform their duties continuously during normal working hours, which Mr Fuentealba Pincheira failed to do. In light of the above, and in accordance with the legal standard, the hours mentioned above, which amount to  hours, should have been deducted from the money due to Mr Fuentealba.' In this regard, attention is drawn to ANFDGAC letter No. // dated  December , which sets out the relevant observations relating to the special audit report in question.
.ANFDGAC adds that on  October , the Director-General of Civil Aviation, through DGAC resolution No. , ordered administrative proceedings with a view to determining possible administrative responsibilities in connection with the report prepared by the internal auditor of the DGAC through official communication (O) No. // dated  September , in the light of the findings from the internal audit and that of the Director-General. In addition, on  November , the Subdepartment of the Southern Airport Zone was subjected to a full audit No. /. This audit presented various findings relating to the compliance by the three regional directors ' the regional president, Dalivor Eterovic Daz, the regional treasurer, Rodrigo Leficura Snchez and the regional and national secretary, Javier Norambuena Morales ' with the legal monthly working hours. In that context, ANFDGAC letter No. //, dated  January , set out the relevant observations on this full audit report. On  November , the Director-General of Civil Aviation, through DGAC resolution No. , ordered administrative proceedings to investigate non-compliance with the legal monthly working hours of the directors of the Association of Officials of the Southern Airport Zone mentioned in audit report No. /, with a view to determining the possible administrative responsibilities that may arise from such facts.
.On  November , the investigating prosecutor, having established a series of facts on the case, decided to close the investigation step in the administrative proceedings instituted against the national and regional director, Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira, bringing his conclusions before the Director-General of Civil Aviation without charges. On  March , the Director-General of Civil Aviation decided to reopen the administrative proceedings, instituted under DGAC resolution No.  of  October , on the grounds that proceedings remain pending, with a view to confirming the complaint lodged by the internal audit office of the DGAC, appointing the official Mr Eduardo Demanet Hurtado as the investigating prosecutor.
.The complainant organization notes that on  May , the Investigating Prosecutor, pursuant to the abovementioned DGAC resolution and DGAC resolution of  March , stated that the Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira was charged with the following: Having repeatedly failed to adhere to his working hours, accumulating  hours of service absence in the audited period from January to August . Consequently, by virtue of exceeding the maximum leave entitlement of  hours per week for trade union officials, without registering any request for the accumulation or transfer of hours within the relevant calendar month, or having duly verified any summons by a public official, as required under the applicable legislation (Act No.  and PRO.DRH No. ), such behaviour is in violation of article (d) of DFL  and article  of Act No. .
.According to the complainant, the charges arising from the administrative proceedings against the national director Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira amount to a violation of article (d) of DFL No.  which states:  The strict observance of the principle of administrative integrity implies morally unimpeachable conduct on the part of officials and honest and loyal service with a view above all to the public interest rather than private interest.' Furthermore, article  states:  The decision of dismissal falls to the appointing authority competent to terminate the services of an official. The disciplinary measure of dismissal can be applied only when the facts constituting the offence are in serious violation of the principle of administrative integrity.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The complainant indicates that, to date, no charges have been brought against Mr Dalivor Eterovic Daz, Mr Rodrigo Leficura Snchez or Mr Javier Norambuena Morales in the administrative proceedings ordered under DGAC resolution No.  of  November . Nevertheless, as both audits present the same arguments, it is expected that these directors will have the same kinds of charges levied against them as those brought against Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira. The complainant considers that all of the above has enabled the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to flagrantly violate freedom of association by disrupting, threatening and denying the legitimate exercise of leave as set out under Act No. , constituting acts of anti-union discrimination and retaliation against the directors by denying trade union immunities through instituting the relevant administrative proceedings with a view to dismissing the ANFDGAC union officials.
.In a communication dated  August , the complainant alleges that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation adopted instructions interfering with trade union activity, which",-1,2011,Chile
73,"ban the posting of canvas signs, notices and banners in the premises under the administration of the Directorate, such as airports, aerodromes or other premises which have not been authorized.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government reports that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation states the following about the allegations.
.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation states that it totally rejects the allegations contained in the ANFDGAC complaint, since they are untrue and, conversely, the actions taken by the DGAC on the matter were strictly in accordance with current legislation and the international conventions signed and ratified by Chile.
.It states that the directors of the association of officials enjoy trade union immunity, protection against dismissal and the right to trade union leave as provided in Act No. , as well as the prerogative to be exempt from undergoing an annual appraisal. Thus, the special status accorded to them would ensure their independence in the proper exercise of their trade union duties.
.It adds that the rules governing the leave of union officials of the association of officials are set forth in articles  and  of Act No. ; that whenever an ANFDGAC national or regional election has been held, the corresponding trade union immunities and legal benefits have been implemented; that in the DGAC there is a national association of officials that elects seven national directors and  regional directors; and that every week each of these officials has a right to  and  hours of leave respectively, which can be amalgamated should the same person simultaneously hold the post of national and regional director. Thus, it notes that the abovementioned officials benefit from  hours of leave as regional directors and  hours as national directors in a statutory -hour working week, i.e. should they play both roles, they devote  per cent of their working week to trade union duties and must perform the duties required under their appointments or contracts for the remaining  per cent of the working week. This would be the case for the directors Mr Guillermo Martnez San Juan, Mr Cristin Fuentealba Pincheira, Mr Manuel Soto Vega, Mr Vctor Hernndez Maulen and Mr Javier Norambuena Morales.
.The DGAC authorities also state that its unit has fully complied with the rules on officials' leave, adhering strictly to the law, granting the  elected directors the leave they are legally entitled to and refraining from assigning duties to those officials. The officials of the association would also have benefited from other leave in addition to that explicitly provided for in legislation, under article  of Act No. , as long as it has been requested in accordance with the instructions of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic. This supervisory body has stated that, should the fulfilment of trade union tasks require extra time, the competent authority, in exercising its general managerial powers, may authorize or refuse any new leave. They state that, notwithstanding the foregoing, ANFDGAC officials may fully participate in training, membership of working groups and activities connected with contests, appraisals, etc., none of which are deemed to fall under the item of trade union leave entitlement.
.They also mention that the Internal Audit Unit undertook as part of its duties internal monitoring, which led to the discovery that there were officials in Concepcin and Punta Arenas aerodromes who were failing to work the statutory monthly working hours, and in particular that there was inadequate monitoring of the attendance and leave of at least three officials. Moreover, of the two administrative procedures referred to in the complaint, one was still under consideration and the other acquitted the officials involved, as it was verified that, despite the fact that they had been repeatedly absent from duty, exceeding leave hour entitlement, the investigation revealed that there were reasons exempting the staff concerned from administrative responsibility, thus concluding the disciplinary process.
.Lastly, the DGAC authorities state that there has been no anti-union practice, nor any acts of retaliation. They also reiterate that the unit has granted all officials of the association of officials, be they national or regional, the right to the leave to which they are legally entitled, thus guaranteeing the exercise of their trade union duties and adhering to the trade union immunity granted under the law, but requiring compliance with current regulations applicable to all public employees.
.For its part, the Government states the following with respect to the allegations. Act No. , which  Sets forth Rules on Associations of Officials of the State Administration'  stipulates in article  that:Senior management of the respective division shall grant the necessary leave to allow the directors of associations to be absent from their work to carry out their duties outside of the workplace, which shall be no less than  hours per week for each director of a national association, or  hours for each director of a regional, provincial or communal association, or which has at least one or more health facilities, and for each regional or provincial director to be elected in accordance with article , subparagraph .Weekly leave entitlement shall be accumulated by each director over the relevant calendar month and each director may transfer to one or more of the other officials all or part of the leave entitlement due to him/her, provided that written notice is given to the senior management of the respective division.However, the limit specified in the aforementioned subparagraphs may be exceeded in the event of a duly certified summons being served on directors of associations, in their capacity as such, by the public authorities, and such summons must be duly verified if required by the senior management of the respective division. The extra hours will not be counted as the hours referred to in the above subparagraphs. The period included in the leave granted to the directors of associations will be deemed to be hours worked for all intents and purposes, thus maintaining the right to remuneration.
.The Government adds that, at the same time, article  of the Act states:Entitlement to the following leave, in addition to that specified in the abovementioned article, shall be granted to:(a)	The directors of associations, with the consent of the respective assembly, adopted in accordance with its statutes, may, while keeping their position, be excused from their obligation to provide their full or part-time services in the division in which they are employed, provided that it takes place for a period of no more than six months over the whole period of their term in office.(b)	The officials may also, in accordance with the association s statutes, take up to five working days of leave in the calendar year to undertake activities that were necessary or deemed to be essential in order to carry out their duties as officials, or to strengthen their capacity as officials.In the cases described in the foregoing, the directors of the association shall inform, in writing and at least ten days in advance, the senior management of the respective division of the circumstances requiring the use of this extra time.
.The Government states that the salaries, benefits and pension contributions borne by the division during the leave periods referred to in this article and subparagraph  of the subsequent article shall be paid by the respective association, but only when the period of paid leave to which the directors are entitled is exceeded, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph  of the aforementioned article.
.For its part, the DGAC established an internal procedure  to record the leave of the directors of the DGAC associations of officials, as provided in Act No.  on Workers Associations in the State Administration'  also known as PRO.DRH No. .The regulation provides in section ..:  Leave time is  hours per week for each director representing the association of officials of the DGAC at the respective regional level, and  hours per week for each association director at the national level. hile section .. of the instrument provides that:  Directors may exceed the allotted time in the event of duly verified summons by public officials.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In the light of the foregoing, the Government notes that the above regulation ensures strict adherence to the principle of freedom of association in the context of trade union officials' leave since, rather than restricting trade union rights in any way, the DGAC authorities, in issuing an internal instruction, did no more than specify the minimum period of  or  hours stipulated in Act No. . Periods exceeding this minimum of hours may be authorized or granted by the authority, in strict compliance with the managerial obligation that falls upon the authorities.
.With regard to establishing the internal procedure, the DGAC authorities developed the so called PRO.DRH No.  to ensure an effective department and adequate monitoring, in accordance with article  of Act No. , which requires the authorities and officials to provide an efficient public administration, ensuring the best use of the instruments available to them. Thus, they merely",-1,2011,Chile
74,"established a monitoring mechanism for officials' leave, as permitted under domestic legislation, and the transfer and accumulation of leave hours, as it was necessary to have a tool to allow the recording of the leave actually taken by each of them.
.The foregoing is in line with the administrative case law of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, which maintained in opinion No.  of  that the authority may adopt any measures it deems appropriate to verify that the leave in question does not exceed the time specified in Act No.  and to require officials not only to give timely notice of their absences, but also to record each period of absence.
.Administrative procedures therefore constitute Chile s administrative mechanism for investigating incidents within public departments in order to clarify administrative responsibilities; thus, the Government considers that it cannot be argued that by merely instituting them the rights to which the directors of association are entitled are being infringed. Similarly, the Office of the Comptroller has noted in its consistent case law that the officials retain their functionary linkage and continue to be subject to the rules of their respective statutes, meaning that should those be violated they would incur administrative responsibility, as specified in opinion No.  of  and other legislation.
.Furthermore, article  of Act No.  recognizes that the directors may incur administrative responsibility in the performance of their duties, i.e. in fulfilling trade union objectives. Thus, the ANFDGAC directors are required to fulfil their usual working day, incurring administrative responsibility if no valid grounds are found for their absence. Otherwise, there would be constant abuse, which would contravene the constitutional principle of equality before the law, exploiting the provision contained in article  of Act No.  in order to avoid compliance with the working hours of all public officials.
.Lastly, the Government adds that the administrative statute regulates and adequately guarantees the rights of interested parties, establishing the right to appear, give evidence, draw up defences and be legally notified and, in the event of being penalized, they had the right to make complaints to the relevant review bodies. In particular, any decision that is handed down in administrative procedures must be sent to the Office of the Comptroller so that an analysis can be made of the legality and constitutionality.
.In the light of the foregoing, the DGAC instituted two administrative procedures against the trade union officials (one of which ended in the acquittal of the officials, as previously mentioned), in respect of which an appeal was lodged with the higher hierarchical authority and subsequently a claim was filed with the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, to obtain an opinion on the legality of the procedure adopted by the Directorate General to record the directors' leave, claiming that the regulation amounted to an anti-union practice and violated national and international rules governing the issue.
.In turn, the monitoring body issued opinion No.  of  December , through which a legal analysis of the internal procedure (PRO.DRH No. ) was made, concluding that it is in accordance with current domestic and international legislation. This conclusion was based on the fact that, while Act No.  does not provide for the possibility of issuing rules on the exercise of the right to leave, it does not preclude senior management from adopting measures, since it is responsible for ensuring the unit s progress and, as such, may take all necessary steps to enable the normal development of the institution. Thus, the national directorate can ask trade union officials to record any absences due to performing the tasks required of them in that capacity, i.e. there may be monitoring in place to prevent directors from using the allowance for purposes other than for those legally granted.
.However, the Board of Directors of the ANFDGAC, unsatisfied with this ruling, asked for the decision to be reconsidered, arguing that the procedure known as PRO.DRH No.  was unlawful. As a result, the Office of the Comptroller supplemented its prior ruling with opinion No.  of  July , reiterating its previous conclusions, i.e. that the procedure contested is lawful and that the manner in which points .. and .. have been drafted cannot be interpreted to mean that a maximum number of hours is being specified for trade union officials' leave entitlement, reiterating that it was up to senior management whether or not to grant hours exceeding the minimum provided for under the rule in question.
.In respect of that conclusion, the Office of the Comptroller maintained that, if carrying out trade union activities required more time, the competent authority, in the exercise of its managerial powers, may authorize or refuse new leave, citing prior rulings.
.The Government states that the DGAC has adopted the measures in the exercise of the powers granted to department heads under domestic law and which are based on the case law of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic. They were not intended to restrict or violate the exercise of the rights granted to directors of the associations of officials under Act No.  and, despite the adoption of those measures, the directors of the association have exercised their rights under Act No. , enjoying the leave entitlement set forth in current regulations.
.Lastly, the Government states that it is important to note that no anti-union act, or violation of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and , has taken place because the DGAC authorities acted within the law. There have been appeals to the administrative authorities, as provided under the law, with supervisory bodies handing down their respective rulings, which maintain that they acted lawfully in implementing procedure PRO.DRH No. . In addition to the foregoing, on a weekly basis each national and regional director took his relevant legal leave entitlement, namely eleven (), twenty two () or thirty three () hours, without the internal monitoring procedure in place causing any obstacle whatsoever to the exercise of the legal right.
.The Committee observes that in this complaint the complainant organization objects to internal procedure PRO.DRH No.  for recording the leave of the directors of the associations of officials of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation as set out under Act No.  on the associations of state administration. The complainant organization alleges that: () Act No.  does not provide for setting down rules on the use of leave entitlement, whereas this was nevertheless set out under PRO.DRH No. ; () PRO.DRH provides for  hours per week of leave for each director representing ANFDGAC and  hours per week for each national association director, and indicates that the directors may exceed the allotted time in the case of duly verified summons by public authorities; () the drafting of this procedure has enabled officials of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to institute administrative procedures against four ANFDGAC officials (Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira, Mr Javier Norambuena Morales, Mr Dalivor Eterovic Daz and Mr Rodrigo Leficura Snchez) since the aviation authority converted the minimum leave limit under Law No.  into a maximum leave limit (to date, charges have been brought against Mr Cristian Fuentealba Pincheira and it is expected that charges will soon be brought against the other officials); and () the adoption of instructions which reiterate the prohibition to authorize installations including canvas signs, notices and banners in the premises under the administration of the Directorate, such as airports, aerodromes or other premises which have not been authorized.
.The Committee notes that the Government reports with regard to the allegations relating to the procedure on trade union leave that the DGAC states the following:(i) the directors of the ANFDGAC enjoy trade union immunity, protection against dismissal and the right to trade union leave as provided in Act No. , as well as the prerogative to be exempt from undergoing an annual appraisal; (ii) the rules governing the leave of union officials of the association of officials are set forth in articles  and  of Act No. ; and (iii) the DGAC has fully complied with the rules on officials' leave, adhering strictly to the law, granting the  elected directors the leave they are legally entitled to and refraining from assigning duties to those officials and there has not been on the part of the DGAC any anti-union practice or acts of retaliation. For its part, the Government states that: () the DGAC established an internal procedure to record the leave of the directors of DGAC associations of officials, as provided in Act No.  on Workers Associations in the State Administration, also known as PRO.DRH No. ; () the above regulation ensures strict adherence to the principle of freedom of association in the context of trade union officials' leave since, rather than restricting trade union rights in any way, the DGAC authority, in issuing an internal instruction, did no more than specify the minimum of hours stipulated in Act No. , from  to  hours (periods exceeding this minimum",-1,2011,Chile
75,"of hours may be authorized or granted by the authority, in strict compliance with the managerial obligation that falls upon the authorities); () the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic issued opinion No.  of  December , through which a legal analysis of the internal procedure (PRO.DRH No. ) was made, concluding that it is in accordance with current domestic and international legislation; and () the ANFDGAC, unsatisfied with this ruling, asked for the decision to be reconsidered, arguing that the procedure known as PRO.DRH No.  was unlawful. As a result, the Office of the Comptroller supplemented its prior ruling with opinion No.  of  July , reiterating its previous conclusions, i.e. that the procedure contested is lawful.
.The Committee recalls that Paragraph () of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), states that:  Reasonable limits may be set on the amount of time off which is granted to workers' representatives.' The Committee observes that PRO.DRH No.  (a copy of which has been sent by the complainant) provides for trade union leave to regional directors ( hours per week) and national directors ( hours per week), that leave may be accumulated over the month, that leave may be transferred to other officials and that during the leave period the officials remain entitled to remuneration and other allowances provided under the law. The Committee also notes that the Comptroller General of the Republic, on request by the complainant organization, ruled that  the proceeding instituted by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, relating to the recording of leave of the directors of the associations of officials of this organization are in line with the standards and case law in force on the matter'  Consequently, in the light of this information, the Committee concludes that the procedure contesting PRO.DRH No.  does not in itself present problems of compliance with the principles of freedom of association.
.Moreover, as to the alleged institution of administrative proceedings against ANFDGAC officials, which, according to the complainant, is in violation of the freedom of association since it disrupts and denies the legitimate exercise of trade union leave, the Committee notes that the Government reports the following: () the Internal Audit Unit undertook as part of its duties internal monitoring, which led to the discovery that there were officials in Concepcin and Punta Arenas aerodromes who were failing to work the statutory monthly working hours, and in particular that there was inadequate monitoring of the attendance and leave of at least three officials. Moreover, of the two administrative procedures referred to by the complainant, one was still under consideration and the other acquitted the officials involved, as it was verified that, despite the fact that they had been repeatedly absent from duty, exceeding leave hour entitlement, the investigation revealed that there were reasons exempting the staff concerned from administrative responsibility, thus concluding the disciplinary process; () an appeal was lodged with the higher hierarchical authority and subsequently a claim was filed with the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, to obtain an opinion on the legality of the procedure adopted by the Directorate General to record the directors' leave, claiming that the regulation amounted to an anti-union practice and violated national and international rules governing the issue; and () the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic concluded that the internal procedure PRO.DRH No.  is in accordance with current domestic and international legislation, and that the national directorate can ask trade union officials to record any absences due to performing the tasks required of them in that capacity, i.e. there may be monitoring in place to prevent directors from using the allowance for purposes other than for those legally granted. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision regarding the pending appeal and expects that the competent authorities will take into account the provisions of Article  of Convention No. .
.Lastly, as regards the allegation that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation adopted instructions interfering with trade union activity which ban the posting of canvas signs, notices, banners or other similar signs in units under DGAC management such as airports, aerodromes and other facilities, without prior authorization, the Committee observes that the Government has not sent its observations in this regard. The Committee recalls that Paragraph () and () of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation No.  states that workers' representatives acting on behalf of a trade union should be authorized to post trade union notices on the premises of the undertaking in a place or places agreed on with the management and to which the workers have easy access, and that management should permit workers' representatives acting on behalf of a trade union to distribute news sheets, pamphlets, publications and other documents of the union among the workers of the undertaking. Also, Paragraph () states that the notices and documents referred to in this paragraph should relate to normal trade union activities and their posting and distribution should not prejudice the orderly operation and tidiness of the undertaking. The Committee expects that the Government will take the necessary steps to bring closer together the authorities of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and ANFDGAC officials, so that, drawing on the provisions of Recommendation No.  with regard to the distribution of trade union notices on the premises, an agreement can be reached on the matter.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision relating to the administrative proceeding instituted against the officials of the ANFDGAC and expects that the competent authorities will take into account the provisions of Article  of Convention No. .(b)	The Committee expects that the Government will take the necessary steps to bring closer together the authorities of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and ANFDGAC officials, so that, drawing on the provisions of Recommendation No.  with regard to the distribution of trade union notices on the premises, an agreement can be reached on the matter.",-1,2011,Chile
76,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in November , and on that occasion submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see nd Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the allegations still pending were that, following a three-day strike in March  over the non-payment of wages and the lack of security experienced by transport workers travelling through an area of ethnic unrest involving the Mapuche indigenous community (a  red zone' , the company Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA dismissed  trade union members. With regard to those allegations, at its November  meeting the Committee made the following recommendation [see nd Report, para. ]:In order to pronounce itself on this case in full knowledge of all the facts relating to the unlawful nature of the strike or work stoppage by the complainant, as well as the dismissal of trade union members, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the rulings of the Concepcin Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, with regard to the cases brought by the complainant organizations, as well as Decree No.  of the National Labour Directorate, dated  February .
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that, with regard to the mass dismissals that occurred in March , the acting inspector reports that, according to information obtained, the workers were dismissed following an unlawful strike, namely a strike which took place outside of the context of a collective bargaining process and held between  and  March  by employees of that company, including members of the Trade Union Number Two  El Bosque' (SNDB). The strike had allegedly been called by Fenasitranfor with the aim of achieving better pay and working conditions. The grounds for dismissal were given as those provided for under article () of the Labour Code, specifically the failure of workers to turn up for work for two consecutive days with no valid reason, two Mondays in any given month, or a total of three days during the same period of time.
.The Government adds that background documents compiled by the Labour Directorate indicate that the work stoppage in question ended following the intervention of the respective Regional Labour Authority. The Government also states that the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Los ngeles reported that  of the workers dismissed in March  filed a joint claim for unfair dismissal to the relevant court against Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA, which was rejected in a ruling issued on  August  on grounds of failure to establish that the dismissals were unfair. Those workers filed an appeal for annulment to the Concepcin Court of Appeal, which rejected that appeal. On  November , the workers in question filed an appeal for unification of jurisprudence to the aforementioned court, which was rejected by the Supreme Court in case No. /. Lastly, the Government states that the workers who were not involved in those court proceedings signed their respective settlements. The Government sent a copy of the Concepcin Court of Appeal ruling rejecting the appeal for annulment filed against the ruling of the presiding judge of the Los ngeles Labour Court which rejected the claim for unfair dismissal. According to the court, the constitutional guarantee that enshrines the right to protest was not violated; there is no reversal of the burden of proof, an argument put forward by the appellant, since the actors themselves recognized that they failed to provide services, as is clear in the claim, thus the burden of proving that there was a valid reason for their absence fell to them; and there is no evident breach of the rules on the appraisal of evidence. The Government also sent a copy of the Supreme Court ruling of  March  in connection with the appeal filed against the ruling of the Concepcin Court of Appeal seeking the unification of jurisprudence in order to annul the ruling issued and declare that the claimants had a valid reason for being absent from work on ,  and  March  and that their dismissals were unfair. The Supreme Court of Justice concluded that there were no different interpretations of the area of law or legal provisions in question and dismissed the appeal for unification of jurisprudence.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the allegations still pending when it examined this case at its November  meeting were that, following a three-day strike in March  over the non-payment of wages and the lack of security experienced by transport workers travelling through an area of ethnic unrest involving the Mapuche indigenous community (a  red zone' , Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA dismissed  trade union members. The Committee recalls that on that occasion it concluded that, according to the Government, the dismissal of the  trade union members was the result of a work stoppage, lasting two days and implemented without prior notice, and was linked to the fact that existing legislation does not permit workers to exercise their right to strike outside of the context of a collective bargaining process. The Committee also notes that: (a) the judicial authority rejected the claims of the dismissed workers in a ruling issued on  August ; (b) the Concepcin Court of Appeal rejected an appeal for annulment filed against the aforementioned ruling; and (c) the Supreme Court, in case No. /, rejected an appeal for unification of jurisprudence. The Committee requested the Government to provide copies of the Concepcin Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court rulings.
.The Committee notes that the Government reiterates the information provided in its previous reply to the effect that the dismissals in question were the result of an unlawful strike, namely which took place outside of a collective bargaining process, and that it sent copies of the rulings as requested. The Committee observes that, according to the Concepcin Court of Appeal, the constitutional guarantee that enshrines the right to free protest was not violated; there is no reversal of the burden of proof, an argument put forward by the appellant, since the actors themselves recognized that they failed to provide services, as is clear in the claim, thus the burden of proving that there was a valid reason for their absence fell to them; and there is no evident breach of the rules on the appraisal of evidence. The Committee also notes that the Supreme Court of Justice concluded that there were no different interpretations of the area of law or legal provisions in question and dismissed the appeal for unification of jurisprudence.
.In this regard, while noting the contents of the rulings that had been requested, the Committee considers that, as it stated during its November  meeting, the calling of a strike by a trade union, if deemed necessary, to protest against the non-payment of part or all of the workers' wages and to demand better security conditions for transport and forestry services constitutes a legitimate trade union activity, including in cases where there is no negotiation process under way to draw up a collective agreement. Furthermore, regarding the Government s argument that strike action in Chile is only possible within the context of a collective bargaining process, the Committee also stressed in its previous examination of the case that the right to strike should not be limited solely to industrial disputes that are likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In this regard, recalling that in the previous examination of the case it found that, according to the Government s earlier reply in this case, existing legislation does not permit strike action (with or without prior notice) outside of the context of the collective bargaining process, the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the workers' and employers' organizations, to take all necessary steps to amend legislation in line with the principles referred to in the conclusions.
.Lastly, taking into account that the dismissals of the  trade unionists were related to the application of legislation which is not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association, the Committee invites the Government to take, given the particular circumstances of this case, in the framework of social dialogue, the necessary measures to bring the parties together with a view to the reinstatement of the dismissed workers or other alternative remedial measures.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	Given that existing legislation does not permit strike action outside of the context of the collective bargaining process, the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with",-1,2010,Chile
77,"the workers' and employers' organizations, to take all necessary steps to amend the legislation in line with the principles referred to in the conclusions.(b)	Taking into account the particular circumstances of this case, the Committee invites the Government to take all necessary steps, in the framework of social dialogue, to bring the parties together with a view to the reinstatement of the workers dismissed or other alternative remedial measures.
.The complaint is set out in a communication submitted by Trade Union Number Two  El Bosque' (Sindicato Nmero Dos El Bosque ' SNDB) and the Federation of National Forestry Sector Transport Trade Unions (Federacin Nacional de Sindicatos del Transporte Forestal ' FNSTF), dated  August . The SNDB presented new allegations in a communication dated  August .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication dated  August , the SNDB and the Federation of National Forestry Sector Transport Trade Unions and Allied Workers of Chile alleged that the abovementioned trade union called a general work stoppage, starting on  March , on the grounds of the company s failure to pay wages for a seven-day week, in spite of the fact that article  of the Chilean Labour Code provides for remuneration for the seventh day of a calendar week (and public holidays), and the serious lack of security at the workplace, with lorries travelling through the territory of the indigenous Mapuche community (considered a  red zone' or zone of ethnic unrest), both by day and by night. The strike aimed to attract the attention of the forestry sector company, Forestal Mininco SA, namely the parent company which awards contracts for forestry and forestry sector transport services to subcontractors. The strike lasted for three days and ended on  March , following the signing of an agreement with the Chilean National Labour Director, who agreed that a statement would be issued, within a period of  days, calling on the employers to pay wages for a seven-day week.
.Nevertheless, the complainant organizations claim that the company Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA subsequently dismissed only the workers who were trade union members, on the grounds that they had been absent from work for two consecutive days, when in fact they had been exercising their right to strike.
.The complainant organizations have submitted the case which was presented before the Labour Court in Los Angeles on  August , and call into question the criteria used by the competent judge to rule against the  complainants, who were all trade union members (these workers had been dismissed; a total of  workers lost their jobs). They also brought complaints relating to other issues presented before the authorities, regarding anti-trade union practices and the company s failure to comply with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
.In their communication dated  August , the complainant organizations enclosed a copy of the ruling of the Labour Court in Los Angeles, dated  July , which fined Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA  tax units for unfair or anti-trade union practices (the failure to deduct trade union dues for the benefit of the complainant trade union, obstacles to collective bargaining and favouritism towards another trade union).
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicated that the complainant organizations referred to a strike (general work stoppage) held from  to  March , held in protest against the company s failure to pay wages for a seven-day week, under the provisions of article  of the National Labour Code, which aims to guarantee remuneration for Sundays and public holidays for workers paid exclusively on a daily basis. The work stoppage also intended to demonstrate the workers were unhappy with the prevailing lack of security at work, namely the fact that they were required to travel, by both day and night, through areas viewed to be zones of ethnic unrest involving the Mapuche indigenous community. According to the allegations, the strike aimed to raise Forestal Mininco SA s awareness of these problems. However, while steps were being taken to end the strike (general work stoppage), Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA allegedly dismissed only the workers who were trade union members, on the grounds that they had been absent from work for two consecutive days, namely the period during which they had been exercising their right to strike.
.With regard to the other issues mentioned in the complaint (the trade union s agreement with the National Labour Directorate, as well as the reference to the  parent company' status of Forestal Mininco SA), the Government indicates that these issues are in no way related to any anti-trade union practices, and it therefore has no comments to make on those matters. However, it wishes to explain that the reference to  parent company' status relates to provisions on subcontracted labour, as laid down in Chilean procedural legislation, namely article  of the Labour Code, which stipulates that, in order for a company to hold  main' enterprise (parent company) status vis--vis a contractor or subcontractor, a number of criteria must be met and, consequently, the existence of a mere civil relationship between the two companies does not imply the existence of any labour obligations (these circumstances are set out in the provisions of article  of the Labour Code and Decree No. , dated , issued by the Labour Directorate).
.The Government states that the right to strike and collective bargaining is enshrined in article (), subparagraphs () and () of the Chilean Constitution, and in article  et seq. of the Labour Code. These provisions stipulate that, in Chile, collective bargaining is an essential prerequisite to the right to strike, without which no strike action can take place. The parties may meet on as many occasions as are deemed necessary during a set period of time ( or  days, depending on the case), in order to negotiate common labour conditions and wages. It is only if the two parties fail to achieve an agreement within the time frame laid down by law that the workers obtain the prerogative to exercise their right to strike, in which case their labour contracts are suspended (article  of the Labour Code) and the workers are under no obligation to be present at work during the strike period, while the employer is under no obligation to remunerate the striking workers.
.In this case, and in line with what has already been established, the situation described does not meet the criteria for strike action, as laid down in the National Labour Code, because the strike was not preceded by a process of collective bargaining. Thus, the labour contracts of these workers were not suspended as a result of the work stoppage, and their obligations towards the company remained unchanged, especially the duty to be present at work. The workers failure to fulfil that duty provided the grounds for their dismissal under article () of the Labour Code, namely the failure of an employee to turn up to work without a valid reason for two consecutive days, two Mondays in any given month or a total of three days in any one month. The behaviour of the workers, namely the work stoppage organized outside of the framework of the collective bargaining process, also constituted a violation of the principle whereby the employer had the right to organize, manage and run their own company, in line with the provisions of article  of the National Labour Code.
.The information above is also supported by Decree No.  of the National Labour Directorate, dated  February  which, in line with its inspection mandate under Chilean law, stipulates that  with regard to the mass dismissals during the month of March , the acting inspector indicates that, according to the information obtained, the reason for the dismissals was an unlawful strike, namely one not preceded by a process of collective bargaining' 
.The Government stresses that article () of the Chilean Constitution guarantees the right to protest, in that it provides for freedom of expression, without any kind of censure. Thus, the workers' individual or collective right to protest is not in any way limited to the collective bargaining process, as workers may legitimately demonstrate their discontent as regards economic and social matters affecting their interests by exercising this constitutional right. However, a complete, uninterrupted work stoppage, lasting two days and called without prior warning, seems an excessive response, as it upsets the fair balance between workers and employers, with regard to the framework of normal labour relations and participation, thereby also affecting other constitutional rights.
.The Government, having established that, under Chilean legislation, the dismissals in question had all been legitimate and justified, needs to determine whether only trade union members were dismissed, or whether the dismissals also affected workers who were not trade union members,",0,2010,Chile
78,"in order to determine whether the workers' employment contracts were terminated on arbitrary grounds, suggesting that these workers had been unfairly dismissed. The Government states that the ruling of the Labour Court in Los Angeles, dated  August  (RIT---), as well as Decree No.  of the Labour Directorate, dated  February , which reported on the action taken by the Labour Directorate in this matter, revealed no signs of arbitrary discrimination with regard to the dismissal only of workers who were trade union members. Moreover, the dismissed workers did not file any complaints or take legal action in the labour courts alleging anti-trade union practices.
.To conclude, a reading of the complaint in question, the attached background documents and the contents of Decree No.  of the National Labour Directorate, does not seem to indicate any violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), both of which Chile has ratified. The Government wishes to reiterate the information stated above, namely the fact that the workers' claims were rejected by the court in its ruling of  August  (RIT -- and --), and the claimants' appeal for annulment was dismissed by the Concepcin Court of Appeal (Case No. -). Furthermore, the appeal launched by the workers on  November  for the  unification of jurisprudence'  was rejected by the Supreme Court (case No. /). Finally, it should be added that the workers not involved in these legal proceedings signed their respective settlements.
.The Government, given the fact that state bodies are required to remain independent and respect the obligation  not to perform judicial functions, assume jurisdiction of cases pending before the courts, review the grounds for or contents of court rulings or reopen terminated proceedings'  undertakes to keep the Committee on Freedom of Association informed of the progress made on the issues still pending in this matter.
.The Committee observes that, in the case presently under examination, the complainant organizations allege, first of all, anti-trade union practices by the company Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA. The Committee notes that these allegations have already been dealt with in a ruling by the Labour Court of Los Angeles on  July , which issued the company with a fine for anti-trade union practices. In the substantive part of the ruling, the court indicated the following:In light of these considerations, and in line with the provisions of articles  et seq. and  et seq. of the Labour Code, the court rules that:I. The respondent, namely Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA, as indentified above, engaged in unfair or anti-trade union practices, which had an impact on freedom of association, by asking the workers who had not participated in collective bargaining process to choose the trade union organization to which the company would pay their legal contribution; the company also failed to withdraw the percentage of trade union members' dues owed to Trade Union Number Two, in line with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code, from the wages of those workers ' who performed similar tasks ' and to whom the company had granted a Christmas/holiday bonus before  December , namely when the only collective agreement in force containing these benefits was the one which had been negotiated with Trade Union Number Two.II. As a result, the respondent is required to pay a fine of  monthly tax units to the National Training and Employment Service (Servicio Nacional de Capacitacin y Empleo).III. Moreover, as there is, to date, no proof that these unfair practices have ceased, once the sentence has been carried out and thereafter, the percentage stipulated in article  of the Labour Code must be withdrawn for the workers mentioned in part I of this ruling, and paid to Trade Union Number Two.IV. Once the sentence has been carried out, the Labour Directorate shall be officially informed and sent a copy of this judgement, in compliance with the provisions of article bis of the Labour Code.V. The accused party is required to pay the legal costs, amounting to , pesos.
.In light of the information above, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant organizations allege that a three-day strike held in March , relating to the non-payment of wages and the lack of security experienced by transport workers travelling through a zone of ethnic unrest involving the Mapuche indigenous community, led to the dismissal of  trade union members. The complainant organizations state that the strike aimed to attract the attention of the company Forestal Mininco SA, namely the parent company contracting transport and forestry sector services from subcontractor employers, and that Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA was responsible for dismissing  workers, who were all trade union members. The complainant organizations stress that the strike ended on  March , after an agreement was reached with the National Labour Director, who agreed to issue a statement calling on the employers to pay wages for a seven-day week (that is to say, including public holidays and Sundays, in line with the provisions of the Labour Code). Finally, the complainant organizations enclose the ruling of the Court of First Instance, relating to the dismissal of  workers, which indicates that  as the fact that the reason for the complainants' failure to perform the duties stipulated in their contracts with Servicios Forestales El Bosque SA was their participation in a strike called by the trade union to which they belonged, which meant that they were unable to autonomously decide whether to work or not, was not recorded in the complaints as the grounds for their absence from work on  and  March , it cannot be taken into account by the court without leading to a ruling on matters which had not been presented before the court, and which would make the court s verdict subject to annulment.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements, according to which: () under the legislation in force in Chile, collective bargaining constitutes an essential prerequisite to the right to strike, without which no strike action can take place; the collective bargaining process allows the relevant parties to meet on as many occasions as are necessary within a set time frame ( or  days, depending on the case), in order to negotiate common working and wage conditions; () only if the parties cannot reach an agreement within the time frame established by law do the workers have the prerogative to exercise their right to strike, in which case the labour contract is considered suspended (article  of the Labour Code), so that the workers are under no obligation to be present at the workplace during the strike, while the employer is under no obligation to pay their wages; () in the specific case brought by the complainant organizations, the situation described did not meet the criteria for strike action under the provisions of the National Labour Code, as it had not been preceded by a process of collective bargaining; as a result, the labour contracts of those workers were not suspended as a consequence of the strike, and their obligations towards the company remained unchanged, especially their duty to be present at work. The workers' failure to fulfil that duty resulted in their dismissal, in line with the provisions of article (), of the Labour Code relating to the failure of a worker to perform their duties without a valid reason on two consecutive days, two Mondays in any given month or a total of three days during that period of time; () the description of the behaviour of the workers, namely a complete work stoppage outside of the context of collective bargaining does, on the other hand, constitute a breach of the principle whereby the employer has the right to organize, manage and run their own company, as laid down in article  of the National Labour Code; () Decree No.  of the National Labour Directorate, dated  February , in accordance with its inspection mandate under Chilean law, stipulates that:  with regard to the mass dismissals which took place in March , the acting inspector indicates that, according to the information gathered, the workers were dismissed following an unlawful strike, namely a strike which took place outside the context of a collective bargaining process'  () the workers' right to protest permits them to legitimately demonstrate their dissatisfaction with their economic and social circumstances and is not limited to the context of the collective bargaining process; however, a complete, uninterrupted work stoppage lasting two days and called without prior notice appears excessive, as it upsets the fair balance between workers and employers with regard to normal labour relations and participation, and also has an impact on other constitutional rights; () the reading of ruling RIT --, issued by the Los Angeles Labour Court, namely the Court",2,2010,Chile
79,"of First Instance, on  August , and Decree No. , issued on  February , which provides information regarding action taken by the Labour Directorate in this matter, reveal no indication of arbitrary treatment, namely the dismissal of only the workers who were trade union members. Moreover, the dismissed workers did not file any claims with a labour court or appeal for the protection of the courts with regard to anti-trade union practices; () the judicial authorities rejected the claims of the dismissed workers in a ruling issued on  August  (RIT -- and --) and the workers' subsequent appeal for annulment before the Court of Appeal in Concepcin (Case No. -) was also dismissed, as was the workers' appeal for  unification of jurisprudence' before the Supreme Court, on  November  (Case No. /); () the workers not involved in these court proceedings ( of the workers, according to the information available) signed their respective settlements.
.The Committee concludes that, according to the Government, the dismissal of the  trade union members was the result of a work stoppage, lasting two days and implemented without prior notice, and was linked to the fact that the legislation in force does not allow workers to exercise their right to strike outside of the framework of a collective bargaining process. The Government stresses the fact that the abovementioned trade union members submitted no allegations of anti-union practices relating to the strike to the judicial authorities, but instead filed complaints relating to other matters.
.The Committee is of the opinion that calling a strike if necessary, to protest against the non-payment of part or all of the workers' wages and demand better security for transport and forestry services constitutes a legitimate trade union activity, including in cases where there is no negotiation process under way to draw up a collective bargaining agreement. In particular, the Committee notes that the right to strike should not be limited solely to industrial disputes that are likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement; workers and their organizations should be able to express in a broader context, if necessary, their dissatisfaction as regards economic and social matters affecting their members' interests [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ].
.In the present case, in light of the principles mentioned above, although the Government has stressed that the strike was called without prior notice, the Committee observes that, according to the Government s reply, Chilean legislation does not, in any case, permit strike action (with or without prior notice) outside of the context of the collective bargaining process. The Committee also observes that, in the case presented before the Court of First Instance, the dismissed workers did not indicate any connection between their dismissal and the strike or work stoppage. However, as the Government has not sent the rulings of the Concepcin Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court ( appeal for unification of jurisprudence'  relating to the claims presented by the members of the complainant trade union, the Committee requests the Government to send these rulings, as well as Decree No.  of the National Labour Directorate, dated  February , so that it may pronounce itself on these allegations in full knowledge of all the facts of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:In order to pronounce itself on this case in full knowledge of all the facts relating to the unlawful nature of the strike or work stoppage by the complainant, as well as the dismissal of trade union members, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the rulings of the Concepcin Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, with regard to the cases brought by the complainant organizations, as well as Decree No.  of the National Labour Directorate, dated  February .",2,2010,Chile
80,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association of Civil Servants of Chiledeportes (ANFUCHID) dated  May . The complainant provided additional information in a communication dated  July .
.The Government submitted its observations through a communication dated  November .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , ANFUCHID, the trade union organization representing public servants in the National Sport Institute of Chile, stated that it signed an agreement protocol with the National Sports Institute on  May . This instrument was signed by the National Director of the Institute and the Legal Director of the General Secretariat of the Government on behalf of the State of Chile; and by the president of ANFUCHID and the chairperson of the National Association of Public Servants (ANEF), on behalf of the employees.
.The complainant organization indicates that the main thrust of the signed protocol was related to the civil service career (and the attendant obligation to adhere to the selection process for admission to the administration through an open competition); the establishment of a series of joint panels on the improvement of the institution (annual strategic plan, programme for management improvement, etc.); the completion of certain tasks pending (basically with respect to procedural processes whose deadlines have expired); the improvement of workers' rights (limits on dismissal, increase in remunerations, etc.); the respect for trade union rights, and, in general, the rights established under the law respecting associations of public sector employees (Act No. ). Furthermore, paragraph  of the abovementioned protocol expressly stated that the Institute s failure to comply with this provision would empower ANFUCHID to adopt any necessary measures, taking the provisions established under Convention No.  of the International Labour Organization into special consideration.
.The complainant organization states that on  March  the current President of the Republic appointed a new National Director of the Institute, who was assigned to his duties on the very same day. On  April , the National Director met with the national board of ANFUCHID and informed its members that he would not observe the protocol since it had been signed by the previous Director and not by him personally. He, therefore, regarded the instrument as not being legally binding upon himself. The Association alleges that since that statement was made, the Institute has failed to fulfil its obligations under the protocol, particularly with respect to the civil service career, and has recruited at least nine persons outside the open competitive process.
.The complainant organization adds that when summoned before the Sports Commission in the Chamber of Deputies, the Director reiterated that the protocol was an agreement signed between his predecessor and the Association, and was therefore not his obligation. In fact, on  May  he said  this is an agreement signed by the previous Director, Mr Jaime Pizarro, and ANFUCHID. It was an undertaking to which I have not subscribed, it therefore does not bind me to the provisions contained therein'  The Association also alleges that on  May  the Director announced the dismissal of  public employees, all of whom had been hired on contract. This action expressly violates the th clause of the protocol, which states that no List  official may be dismissed without undergoing an administrative inquiry to prove fault on the part of the employee.
.In its communication dated  July , ANFUCHID sent a copy of the application for the remedy of protection that it had submitted to the Santiago Court of Appeal.
.In a communication dated  November , the Government recalls that in accordance with section  of Convention No. , the framework for negotiations between public authorities and public employees' organizations are confined to  conditions of employment ... or of such other methods as will allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of these matters'  Using the  literal and logical element' as a rule of universally accepted legal hermeneutics, it can be inferred that the scope of the expression  conditions of employment' would scarcely include the option that the powers granted under the law to a public body for the proper discharge of its functions should be constrained by an agreement between public employees and public authorities. Indeed, such powers do not grant an agency the authority to unilaterally establish conditions of employment in the service, but they do convey the authority that is inherent in the responsibilities attached to a position of leadership, such as the appointment or dismissal of staff, provided that such action does not violate provisions expressly established by law. Therefore, section (b) of the Sports Act (No. ) of  outlines the powers of the National Director, including  the appointment and hiring of staff, the termination of their services, and the adoption of disciplinary measures that are compatible with statutory norms governing such measures' 
.In keeping with the previous paragraph, the Government also states the hypothesis of limiting the inherent powers of the public agency in question, by virtue of an agreement between that body and the public employees, would violate the principle of lawfulness enshrined in the legal order, and specifically, section  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile, which states that  Government agencies shall ensure that their action is governed by the Constitution and the norms enacted in conformity therewith, and safeguard the institutional order of the Republic'  In so doing, the legally conferred powers and prerogatives held by those agencies to properly perform their duties would be waived, and their legal validity under existing domestic legislation would be nullified.
.Similarly, Act No. , the Organic Constitutional Law on the General Principles for State Administration, whose consolidated, coordinated and catalogued text was enacted by decree through the promulgation of Act No.  of , by the General Secretariat of the Presidency, provides, in section , that  action taken by bodies of state administration shall be governed by the Constitution and domestic law. Such bodies shall act within their competence, and shall have no further powers than those expressly granted by law. Any abuse or excess in the exercise of their authority shall give rise to the corresponding rights of action and appeal' 
.From the perspective of domestic legislation, the law respecting associations of public sector employees (Act No. ) states that the main aims of the abovementioned bodies are to  promote economic advancement and improve the living and working conditions of its members; provide support for the development of members; compile information on the work of the public body concerned regarding the plans, programmes and decisions that relate to its employees; notify the competent authorities of any breaches of the rules on the Administrative Statute and others that establish the rights and obligations of public sector employees; represent employees in the forums in which they are legally entitled to participate, and, at the request of the interested party, facilitate representation of the members when dispute assessments under the relevant Administrative Statute are submitted to the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic' 
.As is evident in that provision, the activities of the associations of public sector employees promote the interests of their members, and monitor compliance with the rules governing staff, inter alia, Convention No. . There is nothing to infer the existence of powers to restrict the inherent authority of a public body by virtue of a sublegal instrument.
.As regards the Government s compliance with the provisions of Convention No.  and Act No.  respecting associations of public sector employees, it should be underscored that the public service in question has fully respected the right of its employees to organize, particularly with respect to the provisions of the abovementioned international instrument. It has also ensured adequate protection against all forms of anti-union discrimination related to their employment, and has respected the total independence of the association of public service employees in its rapport with the government authorities. Representatives of recognized public employees' organizations have been afforded the appropriate facilities to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work. In fact, the association of public employees in question has been able to make all the presentations it deemed relevant, and has enjoyed full autonomy with respect to the public authorities, based on the rules set out in its own by-laws and applicable domestic standards. It is therefore difficult to grasp in what manner, according to the complaint presented by ANFUCHID, freedom of association has been affected.
.Regarding the specific legal authority of the National Director to hire staff, the Government referred to section  of the Administrative Statute, approved by Act No. , which describes entry to the civil service career. This does not mean that the law rules out other",-1,2010,Chile
81,"modalities for persons to enter the public service. In order to ensure the proper functioning of duties within the public service, there is need for specific powers and prerogatives, which, by their very nature cannot be applied to all workers falling within the ambit of the regulation governing the  civil service career'  Under administrative law, staff may be recruited through modalities that differ from those applicable to the civil service career, such as the option to hire personnel  on contract'  or in positions of  exclusive trust'  Section (b) of the Sports Act supports this distinction, inasmuch as it includes  the appointment and hiring of staff, the termination of their services, and the adoption of disciplinary measures that are compatible with statutory norms governing such measures' among the powers of the National Director.
.Commenting on the specific powers legally conferred on the National Director with respect to dismissals, and on the decision adopted by the National Board to serve dismissal notifications on  employees on  May  to the effect that their employment would be terminated as their services to the Institute were no longer required, the Government stated that this situation had emerged within the context of the operational restructuring under way in the National Sports Institute of Chile, and was supported by section  of the Organic Constitutional Law on the General Principles for State Administration. The employees who were notified of dismissal had been hired  on contract'  and fell within the scope of Exempt resolution No.  of  November , which extends the hiring of employees by incorporating the wording  as long as such services are required' 
.The Government adds that the Comptroller General of the Republic acknowledged resolution No.  issued by the National Sports Institute in , and which contained provisions on the early termination of services performed by public employees on contract that are identified therein, since the resolution was compatible with existing law and jurisprudence in this area. Furthermore, in numerous rulings, case law has consistently indicated that an appointment on contract that uses the wording  until such services are required' creates a juridical link subject to the discretionary power of the public entity in two respects, a treatment that creates two modalities in civil law: a date of expiry ( December, the date on which all employment  on contract' is terminated), and a resolutory condition (that the services become redundant). These modalities reflect the fundamentally transient nature of duties carried out on contract, a feature that is expressly enshrined in section (c), and section  of the Administrative Statute, approved by Act No. . This is confirmed by the ruling of the Supreme Court Case No. - on remedy for protection (dismissed) of  January , which states  that the transient nature of employment on contract has led the Comptroller General of the Republic to rule in similar cases that  the functions of staff who are hired on contract must expire automatically on  December, unless the contract has been extended, or unless the letter of appointment expressly states an earlier date of expiry' (Case No.  of ); that  it is incumbent on the public authority that appoints the public sector employee to independently determine the appropriateness of extending a contract and, if this is not the case, the employee shall cease to perform his or her function by legal mandate' (/); that   thirty-day period is required only for the purpose of extending the contract, and not for notifying the employee that the contract will not be renewed'  The public authority is entitled to terminate the employment of staff on contract at any time when said contract has been drafted according to the formula  s long as such services are required'  the same criterion applies to its extension (/)'  Judicial decision on Case No. , handed down by the highest jurisdictional body in the Republic, states that  Based on the wording of section  of the Administrative Statute, approved by Act No.  (current section ), employment  on contract' shall only run, as a maximum, up to  December of each year, and nothing shall prevent this duration from being shorter. Moreover, the Comptroller General of the Republic has issued a rule, contained in the Interpreted Administrative Statute (folios  to ), which interprets section  above as follows: during the period in which a public employee is carrying out his or her duties on contract, he or she shall enjoy the rights enshrined in section  of the Administrative Statute (/). Consequently, only the reasons established by decree through Act No.  of  (/) shall give cause for the expiration of such functions, unless the contract is worded  as long as such services are required'  in which case, employment shall be terminated with effect from the time the person concerned has been notified of the completion of the procedure prescribed by the relevant decree or resolution (/, /). Since the challenged Exempt Decree No.  is in line with current legal standards, and was issued by the corresponding authority that was acting within the scope of its powers and responsibilities, it cannot be considered that the abovementioned administrative statute is illegal or arbitrary. It is therefore unnecessary to enter into an analysis, if its passage resulted in an infringement of the fundamental rights of the appellant' 
.The Government highlights the distinction that is made in the case of  career civil servants' who, according to section  of Act No.  on the Administrative Statute, and due to the nature of their duties, enjoy employment stability, under section  of the abovementioned rule, which also provides precise grounds for dismissal. In the performance of functions established by law, and with the authority conferred upon it under the existing juridical framework, the public body has acted legitimately, and has fully complied with the relevant international treaties.
.The Government states that the complaint does not explain in what manner Convention No.  has been violated, and wishes to underscore that it has fully complied with the provisions and principles enshrined in that instrument. It has recognized and promoted freedom of association as a fundamental safeguard that is enshrined in section  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile. As regards remedy for protection submitted by ANFUCHID to the Santiago Court of Appeal alleging that dismissal of the public service employees was arbitrary and illegal, the Government adds that the application for protection was declared admissible by a resolution dated  July . It adds, however, that this does not in any way imply a pronouncement by the Court on the purpose of the proceedings; the request for remedy was examined simply because it fulfils the formal requirements to be considered by the Court. The Government reports that pursuant to a decision dated  October , the Appellate Court later ruled on the merits of the case presented, dismissing the application for protection, with the award of costs to the appellant. Finally, through a judgment dated  October , the Supreme Court confirmed the decision under appeal of  October  issued by the Santiago Court of Appeal, thereby resolving the matter currently before the Committee, rendering it inappropriate to initiate new appeals.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that in violation of the provision of the agreement protocol that had been concluded with the National Sports Institute on  May , the authorities that assumed duty on  March  proceeded to dismiss  public sector employees  on contract' (according to the complainant, the th clause of the agreement protocol states that no employee in List  may be dismissed without an administrative inquiry to prove fault on the part of the employee), and to hire nine persons without a competitive process (in this case, the complainant does not mention which clause of the agreement protocol has been violated).
.In this regard, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () the Sports Act (No. ) of  establishes that the powers of the National Director shall include the appointment and hiring of personnel, the termination of their services and adoption of disciplinary measures in line with the relevant statutory norms; () the hypothesis that the limitation of the inherent power of the public body in question through an agreement between this body and the employees would violate the principle of lawfulness enshrined in the legal order, and would therefore waive the powers and prerogatives granted by law for the proper performance of its functions; () the Organic Constitutional Law of the General Principles of the State Administration No.  provides that the work of the administrative bodies of the State shall be governed by the Constitution and laws, that such bodies shall act within their competence and shall not be endowed with more powers than those expressly",-1,2010,Chile
82,"granted by law. Any abuse or excess in the exercise of such powers shall give rise to the relevant rights of action and recourse; () section  of the Administrative Statute, approved by Act No. , explains the process of entry to the civil service career, but this does not mean that the law does not contemplate other modalities for joining the public service. Indeed, the administrative system allows for the engagement of personnel under terms that differ from those governing the civil service career, such as staff engaged  on contract' and those enjoying positions  of exclusive trust'  () the decision to dismiss  employees because their services were no longer required was presented within the context of ongoing operational restructuring within the Institute, pursuant to section  of Act No.  mentioned earlier; () the employees in question were hired under the  on contract' regime and Exempt resolution No.  of  November of  used the wording  as long as such services are required' for this type of contract; () the Comptroller General of the Republic endorsed resolution No.  of , adopted by the Institute, that allowed  on contract' services provided by public employees to be terminated early, in line with existing legislation and relevant case-law, which had, in numerous rulings, consistently underscored that an  on contract' appointment that uses the wording  until such services are required' creates a juridical link subject to the discretionary power of the public entity; and () ANFUCHID filed an appeal before the Santiago Court of Appeal that was dismissed on  October , and upheld by the Supreme Court on  October .
.The Committee takes note of the arguments of the Government to the effect that the clauses of a collective agreement should not restrict the inherent powers of a public body by virtue of legislation, and observes that the response of the Government infers that, otherwise, legal responsibilities would be enforceable with respect to the authorities. Under these conditions, taking into account the Supreme Court decision, which does not give grounds for inferring the existence of anti-union practices, and mindful of the fact that neither the  dismissals nor the engagement of nine new employees constituted a violation of the agreement protocol, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In addition, with reference to the allegation by the complainant organization to the effect that the new leadership of the National Sports Institute had informed ANFUCHID that it would not honour the agreement protocol, since it was an undertaking signed by the previous Director and therefore not deemed to be legally binding upon on the new regime, the Committee, noting that the Government s reply refers only to the allegations relating to the violations of the agreement protocol previously examined, underlines the importance of honouring collective bargaining agreements and requests the Government to provide information on the validity of the agreement protocol concluded with ANFUCHID in , and on the willingness of the National Sports Institute to comply with the said instrument.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee underlines the importance of honouring collective bargaining agreements and requests the Government to provide information on the validity of the agreement protocol concluded with the National Sports Institute and ANFUCHID in , and on the Institute s willingness to comply with the said instrument.",-1,2010,Chile
83,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , the WFTU states that Chilean legislation contains a series of regulations that are contrary to the conventions and principles of freedom of association. In this case, the WFTU objects specifically to section  of the Labour Code, which stipulates that the replacement of strikers is prohibited, except in certain circumstances.
.According to the WFTU, the employer may always hire strike-breakers to replace workers who are legitimately exercising their right to strike. Sometimes it is authorized from the first day, at other times from the th day of the strike, but in practice strike-breakers begin working from the first day. The WFTU alleges that the outcome of negotiations in Cermica Espejo Ltda, a company founded in  and an offshoot of Cermica Espejo S.A., which has been in operation since , is an example of this. The workers submitted their petition to the company in January  and the company indicated its refusal to negotiate, claiming that it did not recognize the trade union. The Labour Inspection, intervening as provided under the law in the case of a dispute, instructed it to negotiate.
.The WFTU states that the company replied, refusing any form of pay increase, or past or future cost of living rise, and proposing to maintain the current terms for four more years, leaving workers with no practical option but to resort to strike action. The workers exhausted all existing mediation possibilities in an attempt to negotiate with the company, but the company categorically refused any form of negotiation and this led to the strike. The company failed to comply with the provisions of section  and, while it offered to pay the bonus stipulated to enable it to hire strike-breaking workers, it did not comply with the other requirements of the Labour Code, namely to offer a Consumer Price Index (CPI) readjustment. The company hired strike-breakers and also redeployed workers performing other duties to replace the strikers. The situation was reported to the Labour Inspection so that it could be verified, but when the inspector arrived at the company, the grinder, a kiln and the storeroom were in operation and the Inspection, having found one vehicle with a hired driver, plus other workers in the week when the strike began, only reported the presence of one strike-breaker, who was the company caretaker. According to the inspectors, they had to consult with their superiors as to whether or not the others were strike-breakers.
.The WFTU reiterates that the company could not hire strike-breakers and pressure from the workers prompted the Inspection to call for mediation to make the company remove a worker reported by the Inspection as the only strike-breaker, and to seek a negotiated end to the dispute. This mediation took place on the afternoon of the fourth day of the strike. According to the WFTU, the company had achieved its aims during these four days. The company said that it would remove the strike-breaker, which it indeed did that very day, but on the sixth working day it reinstated this strike-breaker, plus hired others.
.Trade union officials subsequently met on the ninth day of the strike to request that the presence of strike-breakers be verified. The Inspection refused to agree to this revision because it stated that mediation would be sought for the following day. This mediation was called for and the company stated that it was obliged to attend, but that no one could force it to negotiate and reiterated that it did not recognize the trade union because it did not exist. In the meantime, ten days had been completed with strike-breakers.
.The WFTU stated that the company was unable to operate the departments on strike, including transport and dispatch, as the workers in those departments were on strike, but, despite that, the employers removed goods from the company s plant with the protection of the Chilean police (Carabineros de Chile). The police, whose responsibility was to maintain public order, actually acted as protectors, thereby enabling an offence to be committed, i.e. the illegal replacement of the company driver and dispatcher who were on strike. The WFTU adds that, as these events occurred on four occasions, officials of the United Federation of Workers (FUT) drew the attention of the police to their illegal act. As a consequence, a second lieutenant tried to intimidate and arrest the trade union officials, which he eventually failed to do. The police were carrying out protection duties to enable the company to remove company products illegally. To put an end to the unlawful police action, the coordinator of the WFTU in Chile went in person to the th police station in Lo Espejo to file his claim that police were protecting an employer. In the police station, a lieutenant told him that he was unaware of the regulation governing them and that they made their own decisions on the deployment of forces outside of the community, and that their task was to maintain public order. According to the WFTU, it was a case of the police making believe that there is disorder in the strike area and thus were so taking appropriate action, something which was absolutely untrue. In the light of the lieutenant of the Lo Espejo police station s endorsement of the unlawful action of his subordinates, the trade union official went to the offices of the southern prefecture of the Santiago police. He was subsequently referred to another unit where the Police Prosecutor s Office was located and where he filed the written claim that the police were protecting the employer. Although the claim was received, he was informed that it would be considered later and that he would receive a reply within  days.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that, with regard to the comments relating to section  of the Labour Code, in its paragraph  it is stipulated that: ' .. the replacement of striking workers shall be prohibited, except when the last offer, formulated in the manner and with the time limit indicated in paragraph  of section  (two days), provides for at least  ? According to the Government, this makes it very clear that the general rule in this matter is that the replacement of striking workers is prohibited, which is perfectly in line with the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos ,  and .
.Notwithstanding the above, the following paragraphs of section  state that replacement workers may be hired provided that at least the following specific and explicit legal requirements are met:(a) Provisions identical to those contained in the contract, agreement or arbitral award in force, subject to a readjustment equivalent to the percentage change in the CPI determined by the National Institute of Statistics, or another body carrying out this task on its behalf, in the period inclusive from the date of the last readjustment to the date of expiry of the respective instrument.(b) A minimum annual readjustment corresponding to the change in the CPI for the duration of the contract, excluding the last  months.(c) A replacement bonus, which shall amount to the equivalent of four  incentive units' (Unidades de Fomento, UF) for each worker hired as a replacement. The total sum of this bonus shall be paid in equal parts to the workers involved in the strike within five days from the date of the end of the strike.In this case, the employer may hire workers as it deems necessary to perform the duties of those involved in the strike from the first day of the beginning of the strike.Furthermore, in this case, the workers may choose individually to return to work from the th day of the beginning of the strike.In the event the employer fails to make an offer as set out in paragraph , and within the time limit stated therein, it may hire workers as it deems necessary for the aforementioned purpose, from the th day of the beginning of the strike, provided it offers the bonus referred to in paragraph , subparagraph c) of section . In this case, the workers may choose individually to return to work from the th day of the beginning of the strike.In the event the offer referred to in paragraph  of section  is delivered after the deadline, the workers may choose individually to return to work from the th day of the delivery of the offer, or from the th day of the beginning of the strike, whichever of these falls first. However, the employer may hire workers as it deems necessary to perform the duties of those involved in the strike from the th day of the",0,2010,Chile
84,"beginning of the strike.For the purposes of section , the employer may make more than one offer, provided that at least one of the proposals meets the requirements set out therein, as applicable, and the bonus referred to in paragraph , subparagraph c).In the event the workers decide individually to return to work, in accordance with the provisions of this section, they must comply with the conditions set forth in the employer s last offer.Once the employer has exercised the rights stipulated in this section, it may not withdraw the offers referred to therein..In this respect, the Government of Chile notes the comments contained in the complaint on the legal existence of the aforementioned exceptions to the prohibition on hiring replacement workers for strikers. It should be explained, however, that the legislator has envisaged these exceptions exclusively for situations explicitly and specifically provided for in law, and whose application entails a considerable financial burden for the employer, which discourages it from exercising this prerogative, particularly when it is exercised from the first day of the strike.
.In this respect, the Government of Chile notes the comments contained in the complaint on the legal existence of the aforementioned exceptions to the prohibition on hiring replacement workers for strikers. It should be explained, however, that the legislator has envisaged these exceptions exclusively for situations explicitly and specifically provided for in law, and whose application entails a considerable financial burden for the employer, which discourages it from exercising this prerogative, particularly when it is exercised from the first day of the strike.
.The foregoing is confirmed in Labour Directorate decision No. / of  August , which states:  ...has been envisaged by the legislator to discourage the replacement of workers from the first day of the strike, since it would render it more expensive to do so ' the bonus must be contained in the employer s last offer so that it may exercise its right to replace workers and so that the employees involved may exercise their prerogative to resume their usual work' 
.With regard to the offences attributed to Cermica Espejo Ltda, the Government states that the company indicated in its letter of observations that, while it is true that it did not offer the minimum annual CPI readjustment, it had offered to pay the replacement bonus of four UF for each worker hired as a replacement. Such an offer legally entitled it to hire replacement workers from the th day of the beginning of the strike and to accept strikers from the th day, in accordance with section  of the Chilean Labour Code. As mentioned by the company in question, this can be verified in memorandum ORD No.  of  March  of the Communal Labour Inspection of Santiago Sur. The company also stated that it had not redeployed its workers to replace the strikers, since work teams included more workers than just those who were on strike. They also stated that they had only hired one night watchman on the th day from the beginning of the strike, when it was already legally permitted to hire replacement workers.
.The Government states that it is of prime importance to note that it is not in a position to give an opinion on the offences contained in this complaint, since any references made are not supported by documents to enable the establishment of a presumption of truth. It adds that Chile has an efficient institutional structure through the National Labour Directorate, an institution which has fully complied with the law in performing its duties of inspection and mediation; hence, should it transpire that a punishable act has been committed, it can establish the relevant offence and ensure the proper exercise of work-related rights. Based on the foregoing, the Labour Directorate instructed the company to negotiate and verified and reported the existence of a replacement worker, thereby exercising the powers bestowed by Chilean labour law.
.The Government adds that Chile has also undertaken a fundamental reform of labour justice administration to safeguard all labour rights provided for both in international treaties signed by Chile and in its Constitution. This reform is guided by basic principles, which include the bilateral nature of hearings, orality, publicity, State authority-initiated proceedings, speciality and immediacy. The claimants did not make use of the mechanisms available to them under the law to ensure respect of their labour rights.
.Notwithstanding the foregoing, it should be noted that the complaint fails to state how the rights defined in ILO Conventions Nos ,  and  have been violated. In this regard, the Government states that it has fully complied with the provisions and principles enshrined in those instruments, recognizing and promoting freedom of association, a fundamental guarantee provided for in paragraph , article , of the Chilean Constitution. In particular, with regard to Convention No. , the right of the workers to form and join the trade union organization in question was respected at all times and the public authorities refrained from any intervention that might restrict this right. With regard to the provisions of Convention No. , and in particular Article , actions taken by the Labour Directorate were in accordance with the international instrument, as the necessary steps were taken to encourage the full development and utilization of machinery for collective bargaining between employers and workers. Lastly, the Government states that it acted in accordance with ILO Convention No. , since the company s worker representatives enjoyed effective protection at all times against any prejudicial act. Their trade union affiliation, participation in the trade union and related activities were especially protected and they were never cut off from the company.
.The Government states that the guiding principles of collective bargaining have been fully respected which, according to the doctrine, stipulate: () it is a fair and peaceful dispute settlement mechanism; () its proceedings must allow the parties to exercise the rights to which they are entitled; () its provisions must promote a flexible working relationship and prevent the outcome of negotiations from interfering with the legitimate rights of third parties; () it must be a technical process, which means that the parties should negotiate with a knowledge of the background to the case and the necessary advice; and () this process must also be responsible and inclusive, enabling the parties to agree on mediation and arbitration mechanisms so that a strike would only take place should it be impossible to reach a solution.
.With regard to the actions of the Chilean police, the Government notes that the company stated that it resorted to police protection for the truck as it left the company, which on one occasion was damaged by Mr Luis Caldern, President of the striking trade union. The company also stated that this person had allegedly cut the electricity supply on four occasions and on three occasions is said to have done the same to the water supply; thus, according to the company, clearly restricting the right to work of those workers who were not on strike.
.The Government states that the police reported that on the occasion in question the chief of police and his staff were present at the scene,  ...interviewing both parties to the dispute, providing an opportunity for them to defend their positions as provided for in law and offering to keep lines of communication with the police open to ensure that public order rules were not transgressed, which is a constitutional and legal obligation of the Chilean police force' 
.In this regard, preventive monitoring mechanisms and patrols are understood to have been put in place to safeguard security and the personal safety of all participants in the dispute, as stated by the police institution in the aforementioned document. During the course of events, police personnel are understood to have gone to the company to verify the claim of non-striking workers, who also expressed concern for their own safety due to their being threatened by striking workers because they were not taking part in the strike, a situation that would lead to the right to work of those workers being affected and restrict their entry into and exit from the company s plant. It should also be noted that the police stated that:  It is not the responsibility of the Chilean police to involve itself in the legal classification of workers, hence it is not possible to discriminate between usual, permanent workers and legal replacement workers.' To avoid major disputes, the respective chief of police remained in constant communication with both parties to the dispute.
.Moreover, the Chilean police stated that, on  March , Mr Jos Luis Ortiz Arcos came and introduced himself to its units as an important official of the WFTU in Chile and is alleged to have demanded to have a meeting with high command. He is said to have been in a blind rage and displaying a defiant attitude. Lastly, they stated in their defence that any action taken by the Chilean police was in accordance with the Constitution and Police",-1,2010,Chile
85,"Constitutional Act No. , since the institution has responsibility for maintaining public order, the personal safety of those involved in disputes and respect for public and private property at all times.
.The Government states that it is paramount to make further reference to the institutional structure of Chile, as the Chilean police force belongs to this group of bodies. Its primary role is to maintain and guarantee public order, which it adeptly fulfilled by undertaking preventive patrol and monitoring duties to safeguard security and the personal safety of all the participants in the dispute; interviewing both parties and acting as a facilitator for smooth communications. It verified the claims of workers who did not join the stoppage and, in particular, it maintained its independence and impartiality, neither discriminating nor making a legal distinction between workers. The conduct of the Chilean police was perfectly in line with Article  of ILO Convention No. , as the workers enjoyed adequate protection at all times against any discriminatory act aimed at impairing freedom of association in their workplace.
.Moreover, according to the Government, it is important to state that the actions of the Chilean police in the case in question are perfectly in line with the criteria set by the ILO to gauge police intervention during the strike, since they were at all times directed at maintaining public order. The Government concludes that at no time has it strayed from the principles enshrined in ILO Conventions Nos ,  and  ratified by Chile and neither has it neglected the principles and rules that inspire and govern labour legislation. The actions of the bodies in question, the Chilean police and the Labour Directorate, were at all times in line with their sphere of competence under the rule of Chilean law, with full respect for ratified international treaties.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization in the present case objects to section  of the Labour Code (which, while prohibiting the recruitment of workers to replace strikers, provides for some exceptions; these are cited in the Government s reply), and alleges that the company Cermica Espejo Ltda hired workers to replace workers striking in January  over a pay claim and that the Chilean police force provided protection to the company so that it could illegally remove goods from its plant given that the workers in the transport department were on strike.
.With regard to section  of the Labour Code on the replacement of striking workers, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the general rule on this matter provided for in paragraph  of the section in question is that the replacement of striking workers is prohibited, but that notwithstanding this, the subsequent paragraphs of section  state that replacement workers may be hired provided that the specific and explicit legal requirements are met; and () the legislator has envisaged these exceptions exclusively for situations explicitly and specifically provided for in law, and their application entails a considerable financial burden for the employer, which discourages it from exercising the prerogative, particularly when it is exercised from the first day of the strike (according to the Government, Labour Directorate decision No. / of  August  stipulates the aim of discouraging the replacement of strikers).
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that on numerous occasions it has emphasized that, if a strike is legal, recourse to the use of labour drawn from outside the undertaking to replace the strikers for an indeterminate period entails a risk of derogation from the right to strike, which may affect the free exercise of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee also notes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has stated on several occasions that section  of the Labour Code is not in compliance with Convention No.  ratified by Chile.
.The Committee also wishes to recall that the hiring of workers to break a strike in a sector which cannot be regarded as an essential sector in the strict sense of the term, and hence one in which strikes might be forbidden, constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association, and that the employment of persons to perform duties which have been suspended as a result of a labour dispute can, if the strike is lawful, be justified only by the need to ensure the operation of services or industries whose suspension would lead to an acute crisis [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend section  of the Labour Code, so that the hiring of workers to replace strikers will only be possible in the event of strikes in essential sectors or services in the strict sense of the term, in the event of minimum services not being maintained, or in the event of an acute crisis, and to ensure that these amendments are effectively implemented.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the hiring of workers to replace strikers by Cermica Espejo Ltda (according to the WFTU, the Labour Inspection reported the employment of one worker during the strike), the Committee notes that the Government states that the company reported that: () although it is true that it did not offer the minimum annual CPI readjustment, it offered to pay the replacement bonus for each worker hired as a replacement; () such an offer legally entitled it to hire replacement workers from the th day of the beginning of the strike and to accept strikers from the th day, in accordance with section  of the Chilean Labour Code (according to the company, this can be verified in memorandum No.  of March  of the Communal Labour Inspection of Santiago Sur); and () it had not redeployed its workers to replace the strikers, since work teams included more workers than just those who were on strike and only one  night watchman' was hired on the th day from the beginning of the strike, when it was already legally permitted to hire replacement workers. The Committee notes that the Government states that: () it is not in a position to give an opinion on the facts, since any references made are not supported by documents that would enable the establishment of a presumption of truth; () the National Labour Directorate has fully complied with the law in performing its duties of inspection and mediation, and in the exercise of its duties it instructed the company to negotiate and verified and reported the existence of a replacement worker (hired under the powers bestowed by law); () a fundamental reform of labour justice administration to safeguard all labour rights provided for both in international treaties signed by Chile and in its Constitution was undertaken, and the claimants did not make use of the mechanisms available to them under the law to ensure respect of their labour rights; and () it has fully complied with the provisions and principles enshrined in Conventions Nos ,  and .
.In these circumstances, noting that, in the context of the dispute, the company in question had hired a worker (which was verified by the Labour Inspection) to replace a striker in the ceramics sector, which is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in the future, workers to replace strikers may only be hired in the event of a strike in essential services in the strict sense of the term, in the event of minimum services not being maintained, or in the event of an acute crisis.
.With regard to the allegation that the Chilean police force provided protection to the company so that it could illegally remove goods from its plant given that the workers in the transport department were on strike, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the company said that it resorted to police protection for the truck as it left the company, as in the past it had been attacked by the president of the striking trade union. The Committee also notes that the Government s indication that the Chilean police reports that: () when the events relating to the complaint took place, they were present at the scene, they interviewed both parties to the dispute and provided an opportunity for them to defend their positions as provided for in law and offered to keep lines of communication with the parties open to ensure that public order rules were not transgressed, which is a constitutional and legal obligation of the Chilean police force; () in this regard, preventive monitoring mechanisms and patrols were put in place to safeguard security and the personal safety of all participants in the dispute; () during the course of the dispute, police personnel went to the company to verify the claim of non-striking workers, who had expressed concern for their own safety due to their",-1,2010,Chile
86,"being threatened by striking workers; () it is not the responsibility of the Chilean police to involve itself in the legal classification of workers, hence it is not possible to discriminate between usual, permanent workers and legal replacement workers; () an official of the WFTU introduced himself to police units on  March  and is alleged to have been in a blind rage and displaying a defiant attitude; and () any action the police took was in accordance with the Constitution and the Police Constitutional Act, since the institution has responsibility for maintaining public order, the personal safety of those involved in disputes and respect for public and private property. Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government states that the actions of the Chilean police were perfectly in line with the criteria set by the ILO to gauge police intervention during the strike. Taking into account all of this information and, in particular, that the police intervention did not lead to disorder or violence and that, according to the police, the non-strikers were being threatened, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take steps to amend section  of the Labour Code, so that the hiring of workers to replace strikers will only be possible in the event of strikes in essential services in the strict sense of the term, in the event of minimum services not being maintained, or in the event of an acute crisis and to ensure that these amendments are effectively implemented.",-1,2010,Chile
87,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it made the following Recommendations within the context of actions taken by the Metropolitan South Regional Public Prosecution Service as a result of the establishment of the Association of Public Employees of the Metropolitan South Regional Public Prosecution Service (AFFRMS) [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee notes the efforts undertaken by the Government to progress with the resolution of the pending issues.(b) The Committee expects that the Government, as it has indicated, will provide information on the action taken to promote dialogue and collective bargaining between the Regional Public Prosecutor and the complainant association. The Committee also requests the Government to take measures to restore mutual respect between the parties.(c) The Committee deplores the anti-union conduct of the Regional Public Prosecutor as ascertained and penalized by the competent authority and requests the Government to ensure the exercise without hindrance of trade union rights in this public prosecution service and the application of sufficiently dissuasive sanctions so as to prevent this type of conduct.(d) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to indicate whether the seven members referred to who were dismissed and the employees Mr Anguita Carrin and Mr Prez Jeldres (dismissed) and Ms Caballero Jimnez (private warning) have taken action in the courts against these measures on the grounds of anti-union practices.(e) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide the text of the administrative decisions and of any criminal rulings concerning the former trade union leader, Mr Csar Torres, so that it can review all of the facts.(f) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to transmit any administrative or judicial decisions adopted in relation to the procedures instituted by the Public Prosecutor, Mr Pedro Orthusteguy Hinrichsen, for anti-union practices, on the grounds of his alleged demotion to the level of deputy prosecutor for giving evidence in the procedure relating to anti-union practices by the Regional Public Prosecutor.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the present complaint against the Office of the Public Prosecutor was made as a result of various situations which arose at the time of the establishment of the AFFRMS, and during the period that immediately followed that event, between March  and August . Furthermore, subsequent to this period the said association of public employees had carried out its functions and exercised its rights without any restrictions whatsoever, maintaining a relationship of mutual respect with the regional authorities. The directors of the association made use of the trade union leave granted them by law and the facilities afforded them to allow them to meet with their members and to renew their executives and were received by the authorities of the Regional Public Prosecution Service. Furthermore, the AFFRMS came together with other regional associations of public employees to form the National Federation of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, fulfilling its purposes and exercising its rights without any restrictions. Both the AFFRMS and the abovementioned National Federation work with the national authorities of the Office of the Public Prosecutor and are regularly received by those authorities, which encourage their participation in official bodies in their capacity as representatives of the public employees. The Committee notes with interest the information relating to the application of Recommendations (a)' c).
.As to an eventual administrative or judicial decision adopted in the light of the procedures instituted by the Public Prosecutor Mr Pedro Orthusteguy Hinrichsen for anti-union practices, the Government states that Mr Orthusteguy has not instituted any administrative or judicial procedures regarding his change in responsibilities. Mr Orthusteguy was appointed Assistant Public Prosecutor grade VI, and while he worked as Head Public Prosecutor of a local Office of the Public Prosecution Service he received grade IV remuneration. In May of  he was transferred to another local Office of the Public Prosecution Service, where he no longer carried out the functions of a Head of Office, and he again received the remuneration corresponding to the grade of his appointment. The Government states that, by legislation, the Regional Public Prosecutor is the sole authority with the power to appoint or maintain prosecutors in the post of Head Prosecutor and, therefore, the Regional Public Prosecutor cannot be accused of anti-union conduct as he was exercising his legal powers. The Committee notes this information, and given that Mr Pedro Orthusteguy has not instituted proceedings for anti-union practices, it will not continue with its examination of this aspect of the case.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the complainant organizations have not sent the information requested in Recommendations (d)' e) since March .
.The present complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  of the National Association of Public Servants (ANEF) and the Association of Public Employees of the Metropolitan South Regional Public Prosecution Service (AFFRMS).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint the complainant organization alleges in the first place acts by the authorities of the Metropolitan South Regional Public Prosecution Service to impede and raise obstacles to the establishment of the AFFRMS (expression of opinions on the illegality of establishing the association, inciting members to resign their membership and warning that the association could not affiliate with higher level organizations, such as the ANEF or the CUT).
.The Committee notes the Government s indications that: () the legislation provides with total clarity for the right to organize of the public employees of the Department of the Public Prosecutor and that of their associations to affiliate with higher level organizations; () the complainant association was validly constituted; () in the hypothesis that the authorities expressed opinions or issued warnings, as indicated in the complaint, they would be reproachable, although in any event the law holds as null and void any act that is not confined to the attributions established by the law for such officials and authorities, and those concerned are entitled, in accordance with the law, to take legal action to safeguard the exercise of their right to organize; and () the complaint does not however provide any document or evidence demonstrating any action by a public official in the discharge of her or his functions which, in view of the context, may be held to constitute an objective obstacle to the establishment of an association of public employees. Furthermore, the Committee notes the Government s indication that the complainant organizations have not provided proof of such acts, but that it recognizes that the Regional Public Prosecutor was subsequently penalized for other types of anti-union practices. Under these conditions, as the complainant association has been established, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.With reference to the alleged demand by the management of the Department of the Public Prosecutor for the lists of members of the complainant organization, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the determination of the representative nature of the association and the deduction of trade union dues from the payroll require the provision of this list, and that the Directorate of Labour does not provide lists of members of associations without previous authorization by the organization concerned.
.In respect of the alleged demand by the management of the Public Prosecution Service for the statutes of the association, the Committee notes the Government s indication that under Chilean legislation only the national labour inspectorate may make comments on the act establishing an association of public employees, which may be referred as appropriate to judicial oversight.
.With regard to the alleged refusal of the authorities of the Regional Public Prosecution Service to engage in dialogue and to receive the leaders of the complainant association to address various problems and the aggressive attitude of the chief of human resources of the Public Prosecution Service, thrusting a copy of the Code of Good Labour Practices in the face of the President of the complainant association (an attitude to which the Government has not responded), the Committee notes the recognition by the Government of possible deficiencies in the Department of the Public Prosecutor concerning collective bargaining of terms and conditions of employment, and the indication that it will inform the ILO of any action envisaged to change this situation. The Committee awaits this information and expects that measures will be taken to promote dialogue and collective bargaining between the parties, as well measures to restore mutual respect between the parties.
.As to the alleged use by the management of public prosecution services of a model letter for members of the complainant association to resign their membership, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () it does not have the evidence referred to in the complaint (electronic mail from the Regional Public Prosecutor to service managers to obtain the resignation of members, the model letters sent to employees for the resignation of their membership, the letters from the officers",1,2008,Chile
88,"of the association requesting meetings); () these would constitute reproachable and punishable situations; () the National Public Prosecutor of the Department of the Public Prosecutor initiated an investigation into the Regional Public Prosecutor; () the investigation found anti-union practices by this Public Prosecutor and applied the penalty of written censure; () it cannot comment on whether or not the complainant employees had access to the same supporting information as the Public Prosecutor who was penalized as the complainant associations which claim that the employees did not have the same supporting information have not provided evidence in this respect; () the legislation allows for judicial appeals against decisions to deny access to supporting information or information that directly or essentially supplements it, except in specific cases; and () the penalty imposed on the Public Prosecutor may appear weak to the complainant organizations, but it represents a criticism of his conduct and was applied in accordance with the merits of the procedure.
.The Committee deplores the anti-union conduct of the Regional Public Prosecutor as ascertained and penalized by the competent authority and requests the Government to ensure the exercise without hindrance of trade union rights in this public prosecution service and the application of sufficiently dissuasive sanctions to prevent this type of conduct.
.With reference to the allegations relating to the leader of the association, Ms Paulina Ruiz Tapia (the opening of an administrative investigation with various procedural flaws, which resulted in a verbal warning in relation to trade union leave that she had taken on  September  without notifying the management ' according to the allegations, due to the material impossibility of doing so, as all the personnel were engaged in a recreational activity), the Committee notes the Government s statements according to which: () the initiation of an administrative investigation into facts that were finally established in relation to the leader of the association, Ms Paulina Ruiz Tapia, does not provide grounds for inferring the existence of an anti-union practice; () the complainant association does not describe the alleged procedural flaws; and () there is no evidence of the proposal, as maintained by the complainants, of a penalty of suspension for six months; in practice, the employee appealed against the decision to impose a fine of  per cent of her remuneration for a month and the Regional Public Prosecutor upheld the appeal in part, applying a disciplinary sanction of a private warning; furthermore, the investigation did not begin in October  into events that occurred on  September , as claimed by the complainants, but commenced on  July , meaning that the reason for the administrative procedure is not the one indicated in the complaint, but the early withdrawal without authorization from the support shift of hearings to supervise detentions and the use of a radio taxi coupon without due authorization by the employee concerned. Under these conditions, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.In respect of the alleged dismissal of seven members of the complainant association (four on the grounds of the necessities of the Public Prosecution Service and three due to an unsatisfactory evaluation), the Government indicates that they were not dismissed for unsatisfactory service, but in the context of the legislation respecting  necessities of the National or Regional Public Prosecution Service which shall be determined by the National Public Prosecutor once a year, having previously notified the General Council'  which gives entitlement to the payment of compensation for years of service. The Committee notes the Government s statement that those concerned may appeal to the judicial authorities if they consider that the termination of their contracts of employment constituted anti-union practices. With reference to the investigation into the employees Mr Luis Prez Jeldres, Mr Matas Anguita Carrin and Ms Chriss Caballero Jimnez, the Government also indicates that they can take action in the courts in the event of the violation of freedom of association, and that the investigation relates to monies missing from those held by the Regional Public Prosecution Service in March , the inconsistencies between the physical count and the control undertaken by the custodian and deficiencies in compliance with the regulations respecting the holding of monies seized by the Department of the Public Prosecutor. In these circumstances, the Government adds that the Regional Public Prosecutor applied the penalty of the dismissal of the employees Matas Anguita Carrin and Luis Prez Jeldres (this penalty was confirmed on appeal to the National Public Prosecutor) and issued a private warning to the employee Ms Chriss Caballero Jimnez. The claim by the complainant organizations that there was a parallel criminal investigation into the matter, which did not lead to any charges being brought, is not contradictory as, in accordance with the legislation  An administrative penalty is independent of civil or criminal liability'  although in the event of a verdict of acquittal, the reopening of the administrative investigation may be requested within three months, and if acquittal is pronounced, reinstatement shall be ordered.
.Taking into account the Government s explanations, the Committee requests the complainant organizations to indicate whether the seven employees referred to above who were dismissed and the employees Anguita Carrin and Prez Jeldres (dismissed) and Ms Caballero Jimnez (private warning) have taken action in the courts on the grounds of anti-union practices.
.With regard to the allegation respecting Mr Csar Torres, former Secretary of the complainant association, the Committee notes that the Government has provided information from the National Department of the Public Prosecutor, according to which, following the administrative investigation, Mr Csar Torres was penalized by the disciplinary measure of dismissal, which was confirmed on appeal (the penalty is related to a link between the latter employee and a lawyer questioned by the Specialized AntiNarcotics Public Prosecution Service). The Committee observes that, according to the complainants, the latter employee was not able to have access during the procedure to the recording of the intercepted telephone conversation attributed to him, and that the charges relating to drug trafficking and the theft of important information were found to be totally false by the Regional Public Prosecution Service and, secondly, by the National Public Prosecution Service. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide the text of the administrative decisions and of any criminal rulings concerning this former leader of the association so that it can review all of the facts.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to transmit any decisions adopted in relation to the procedures instituted by the Public Prosecutor, Mr Pedro Orthusteguy Hinrichsen, on the grounds of his alleged demotion to the level of deputy prosecutor for giving evidence in the procedure relating to anti-union practices by the Regional Public Prosecutor.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes the efforts undertaken by the Government to progress with the resolution of the pending issues.(b) The Committee expects that the Government, as it has indicated, will provide information on the action taken to promote dialogue and collective bargaining between the Regional Public Prosecutor and the complainant association. The Committee also requests the Government to take measures to restore mutual respect between the parties.(c) The Committee deplores the anti-union conduct of the Regional Public Prosecutor as ascertained and penalized by the competent authority and requests the Government to ensure the exercise without hindrance of trade union rights in this public prosecution service and the application of sufficiently dissuasive sanctions so as to prevent this type of conduct.(d) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to indicate whether the seven members referred to who were dismissed and the employees Mr Anguita Carrin and Mr Prez Jeldres (dismissed) and Ms Caballero Jimnez (private warning) have taken action in the courts against these measures on the grounds of anti-union practices.(e) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide the text of the administrative decisions and of any criminal rulings concerning the former trade union leader, Mr Csar Torres, so that it can review all of the facts.(f) Finally, the Committee requests the Government to transmit any administrative or judicial decisions adopted in relation to the procedures instituted by the Public Prosecutor, Mr Pedro Orthusteguy Hinrichsen, for anti-union practices, on the grounds of his alleged demotion to the level of deputy prosecutor for giving evidence in the procedure relating to anti-union practices by the Regional Public Prosecutor.",-1,2008,Chile
89,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Teachers' Association of Chile dated  May . The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  March .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the Teachers' Association of Chile alleges that, on  August , the legal representative of the Carmelite Educational Society of Via del Mar (SODEC Ltda.), was notified of a draft collective labour agreement presented by the Union of Education Professionals of the schools under the administration of that enterprise, namely, Jerusaln and Ciudad de Paz.
.That legal representative, the interim administrator, was appointed by the UnderSecretariat of Education, in accordance with Decision No.  of  April , because the accreditation of the private enterprise that was the administrator (sostenedora) of the abovementioned schools had been withdrawn by virtue of Decision No.  of  June  of the state authority.
.The abovementioned interim administrator, a representative of the Chilean Government, refused to accept this draft collective agreement and refused to bargain collectively, allowing furthermore, in breach of the legal provisions in force, the former administrator (sostenedora) and owner of the schools in question to dismiss, without the right to compensation, the members of the Union of Education Professionals of those schools on  August , in violation of the specific provisions of the Labour Code on immunity during the collective bargaining process.
.Similarly, the abovementioned legal representative appointed by the Chilean Government refused to comply with the  decision of the Second Labour Court of the First Instance of Valparaso, under Case No. -, ordering the reinstatement of dismissed union official Cecilia Arancibia Pastn.
.The complainant organization indicates that the decision of the Head of the Legal Division of the Department of Labour, dated  October , and that of the Municipal Labour Inspector of Via del Mar of  August , which are attached to the complaint, are evidence of these failures.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states that the violations mentioned in the text of the complaint consist of the following: () the refusal by the interim administrator of the Jerusaln and Ciudad de Paz schools to accept the collective bargaining request and to bargain collectively; () the refusal by the same interim administrator to comply with the decision issued by the Second Labour Court of the First Instance of Valparaso, ordering the reinstatement of union official Cecilia Arancibia Pastn; and () on  August , the former administrator (sostenedora) and owner of the schools in question allegedly dismissed, without the right to compensation, the members of the schools' Union of Education Professionals, in violation of the specific provisions of the Labour Code on immunity during the collective bargaining process.
.The Government indicates that the interim administrator of the Jerusaln and Ciudad de Paz schools was appointed by Exceptional Decision No.  of  April  of the Chilean Ministry of Education, with the aim of safeguarding the right to education of the schools' pupils during , as the aforementioned educational authority had found, early on in the academic year, a series of irregularities in the management of these schools by SODEC Ltda., the enterprise that was at that time their administrator (sostenedora). The purpose of the appointment was to enable  the normal development of school activities in both educational establishments' and  pupils of these schools to complete their studies in a normal manner until the end of ' in the schools where they had started the school year.
.The reason for the appointment was to address a situation that had a specific end date and covered the period between April and December  (the date of the end of the school year), as reflected in the wording of Exceptional Decision No.  of the Ministry of Education, dated  April . This administrative act was designed to safeguard the right to education of the pupils in the schools in question, which in the absence of an administrator (sostenedora) could not apply for the educational grant provided by the State pursuant to Decree No. / of the Ministry of Education, or provide any education that was recognized by the State. Its aim was also to prevent the pupils from missing the  school year.
.The Government sends information from the Regional Department of Education of Valparaso, which indicates that, on  April   a meeting was held with the representatives of the Valparaso Teachers' Association and some members of the executive committee of the schools' trade union to discuss the possible courses of action, at which it was agreed that by Monday  April  the Regional Department of Education would hold a meeting with the lawyer representing some of the parties that had previously participated in the proceedings to liquidate the enterprise in question to agree on how to expedite the process of appointing a liquidator for the enterprise, as a result of which agreement was reached on the appointment of the interim administrator by the Ministry, under the necessary conditions' 
.The Government reports that the workers at the schools mentioned in the complaint were fully aware of the situation that would affect them, and particularly of the imminent termination of their functions as of the  school year. In fact, on  March , the Ministerial Secretary of Education informed union members and teachers from both schools that the administrator (sostenedora) of the schools would cease to be in effect and of the immediate consequences of such a development, which included the withdrawal of accreditation to run as schools and the non-payment of the state grant that is given for each pupil. Under these conditions, the schools would not have been able to operate as educational establishments even during ; however, in order to avoid leaving the pupils with insufficient time to move to other schools and/or facing the risk of missing the  school year, the interim administrator was appointed.
.It is in these circumstances that, on  July , and just four months before the end of the period of the interim administration of the abovementioned schools, the interim administrator was informed of a draft collective agreement, which would cover the period ' . The interim administrator had neither the authority nor the budget to meaningfully involve the schools under its administration in a collective bargaining process governed by the Labour Code.
.Given the circumstances outlined above and notwithstanding the fact that the interim administrator had effectively refused to accept the request for a collective bargaining process (as recorded in Regular Report No.  requested to that end from the National Labour Directorate), it should be noted that the working conditions that this draft was intended to govern in the future would not exist beyond December , the expiry date of the authorization granted by the interim administration. In other words, the agreement would apply for only four months.
.However, as established in the first paragraph of section  of Chile s Labour Code,  the duration of collective agreements and arbitration decisions shall be no less than two years and no more than four years.' In these conditions, it was not possible to engage in what was known under national regulations as  regulated collective bargaining' 
.In accordance with the principle of good faith, broadly recognized in the jurisprudence of the Committee on Freedom of Association in various reports, it was appropriate and in line with that principle to warn employees about the imminent loss of their source of employment and to encourage them to move to other schools, rather than to negotiate pay and working conditions that were impossible to meet. Doing this amounted to engaging in a  spurious' and  non-genuine' simulation of a bargaining process. Indeed, according to the jurisprudence of the Committee on Freedom of Association,  it is important that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement; moreover genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Regarding the allegation that the appointed interim administrator had refused to comply with the decision of the Second Labour Court of the First Instance of Valparaso, under Case No. -, ordering the reinstatement of dismissed union official Cecilia Arancibia Pastn, the Government states that, on the basis of a report requested from the National Labour Directorate, it is established that the Regional Labour Directorate of Valparaso actually initiated these proceedings on anti-union practices, but against the enterprise SODEC Ltda., because it was this enterprise, in its capacity as administrator (sostenedora) of the schools and employer of the trade union official, that dismissed the union official. According to information provided by the Labour Directorate, there is no indication that the interim order to reinstate the union official, issued in the proceedings on anti-union practices that had been initiated against",0,2008,Chile
90,"the administrator (sostenedora), had been carried out. At present, the court case is pending and no final decision has been reached.
.As to the third allegation in the complaint, namely that, on  August , the former administrator (sostenedora) had dismissed, without the right to compensation, the members of the Union of Education Professionals of the schools in question, in violation of the specific provisions of the Labour Code on immunity during the collective bargaining process, the Government states that, on the basis of a report of the National Labour Directorate, the Regional Labour Directorate of Valparaso brought Case No. - before the Second Labour Court of the First Instance of Valparaso on the grounds of the illegal dismissal of workers covered with trade union immunity in collective bargaining. This case is pending before the court, and no final decision has been reached.
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainant s allegations relate to: () the refusal of the interim administrator of the Carmelite Educational Society of Via del Mar (SODEC Ltda.), and more specifically of the Jerusaln and Ciudad de Paz schools, to accept the draft collective agreement presented by the trade union and to bargain collectively; () the illegal dismissal on  August  of the members of the union, in violation of the legal provisions relating to trade union immunity; and () the refusal of the abovementioned interim administrator to comply with a court decision ordering the reinstatement of trade union official Cecilia Arancibia Pastn. The complainant organization explains that the interim administrator was appointed by the Under-Secretariat of State on  April  after the accreditation of the enterprise SODEC Ltda. was withdrawn on  June .
.The Committee notes the statements by the Government explaining the context of the allegations, according to which: () the Ministry of Education found, early on in the academic year (), a series of irregularities in the enterprise s administration; () the appointment of the interim administrator by the authorities was aimed at safeguarding, until the end of the school year in December , the right to education of the schools' pupils so that the students would not miss the  school year; according to the Government, in such conditions the limited liability company in question could neither apply for the educational grant provided by the State nor provide State-recognized education (because the accreditation to run as schools had been withdrawn); in fact, the Government refers to proceedings to liquidate the enterprise; () in April , the authorities of the Ministry of Education held a meeting with members of the Valparaso Teachers' Association and some members of the executive committee of the affected schools' trade union to discuss the possible courses of action, reaching agreement on the appointment of an interim administrator; in any case, according to the Government, the employees of the schools and the members of the union were aware of the imminent termination of their functions as of the  school year and they were notified accordingly by the Department of Education in March .
.More specifically, with regard to the alleged refusal by the interim administrator appointed by the authorities to accept and negotiate the draft collective agreement presented by the trade union, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () rather than to negotiate pay and working conditions that were impossible to meet in the circumstances described above, it was in accordance with the principle of good faith to warn the employees of the imminent loss of their jobs and to encourage them to move to other schools; () the draft collective agreement was submitted by the union on  July  (a few months before the end of the period of the interim administration of the schools) and was intended to cover the period '  with the result that the interim administrator had neither the authority nor the budget to participate in a collective bargaining process for the schools that were going to close down at the end of ; and () under Section  of the Labour Code, collective agreements must have a duration of no less than two years which meant that it was not possible to negotiate under the regulations under the Labour Code relating to regulated collective bargaining. The Committee understands that this reference to  regulated' bargaining (which is impossible, according to the Government, from a legal standpoint) implies that other types of agreement were not ruled out (non-regulated collective bargaining also exists in Chile), for example those on the effective implementation of standards on legal entitlements upon termination of an employment relationship.
.The Committee concludes that the refusal of the interim administrator to negotiate as part of a regulated collective bargaining process a draft collective agreement that continued to be applicable even years after the closure of the two schools did not constitute in the circumstances described a violation of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining, although it considers that the interim administrator should have explained the reasons for its refusal to the authorities of the Ministry of Education and the union, instead of refusing (as is indicated in the documents sent by the complainant organization) to give answers and to communicate the draft text to all the employees as is required by law in cases where a trade union presents a draft collective agreement to an enterprise. It also considers that the interim administrator should have been open to dialogue and negotiation in connection with the questions relating to the impact of the school closures on the workers and their rights.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the dismissal of the secretary-general of the Union, Cecilia Arancibia Pastn, and to the refusal of the interim administrator to comply with the court decision ordering her reinstatement, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () it was the regional labour authorities that initiated the proceedings on anti-union practices; () there is no indication that the interim reinstatement order issued by the court has been carried out; and () the court case is pending and no final decision has been made. The Committee regrets that the interim administrator did not carry out the reinstatement order issued by the court although it understands that the issue of reinstatement is no longer relevant insofar as the two schools have been closed down. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings and expects that, should anti-union practices be determined, the final decision will provide for the payment of all the secretary-general s unpaid wages and legal entitlements.
.Lastly, with regard to the alleged dismissal of trade union members without the right to compensation on  August , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, a case on the illegal dismissal during the collective bargaining process of workers with trade union immunity against dismissal is being processed by the courts. According to the Government, these proceedings were initiated on the basis of a report by the National Labour Directorate. The Committee understands that the matter of the reinstatement of these workers is no longer relevant following the closure of the two schools. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these proceedings and expects that, should anti-union practices be determined, unpaid wages and other legal entitlements will be paid to those concerned.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the court proceedings relating to the dismissal of the secretary-general of the complainant union and the members of that union, and expects that, should anti-union practices be determined, unpaid wages and other legal entitlements will be paid to those concerned.",-1,2008,Chile
91,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the National Federation of Sanitation Workers (FENATRAOS).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , FENATRAOS states that it is composed of  primary-level trade unions comprising , members across the country. It adds that in , by means of Decision No.  of the Ministries of Defence, Economic Affairs, and Labour and Social Security and in response to the review called for by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, Case No. , the Government exempted sanitation company workers from the prohibition of the right to strike which had been in force until then. That position was upheld by the Government in , by means of Decision No.  of the same ministries.
.In accordance with this new position based on the guidelines of ILO Conventions Nos  and , the Government agreed with the unions that there was no obstacle to calling a strike in enterprises in the sector. The Government s considerations included the following factors: (a) a large proportion of workers in sanitation companies are not engaged in actual water production or sewage treatment, and hence any stoppage would have no justification and be absolutely arbitrary; (b) with regard to persons directly involved in the provision of essential services, the collective bargaining regulations provide for institutions which are perfectly capable of ensuring continuity of service, as is the case with the formation of emergency teams (Labour Code, section ), which is obligatory in the case of enterprises which provide  special services'  the enterprise can hire replacement staff (Labour Code, section ); the authority can order the resumption of work (Labour Code, section ); and (c) the employment reality of sanitation companies is so distorted, through the direct responsibility of the enterprises themselves, that the prohibition of strikes is totally ineffective owing to the fact that water production and sewage treatment is largely carried out by staff from contracting or subcontracting enterprises.
.FENATRAOS alleges that unfortunately the review undertaken by the Government to ensure strict compliance with Conventions Nos  and  has been frustrated by the action, beyond the scope of its competence, of the office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, which, meeting a request from private sanitation companies mostly funded by multinational capital, declared the Government s decision illegal by means of Ruling No. , deeming sanitation companies to provide essential services, which, in the abovementioned office s view, obliges the Government to impose on them an absolute prohibition of the right to strike. (The office s ruling states that sanitation service providers should be included in the list of entities whose workers may not go on strike.)
.According to the complainant, the ruling breaches the provisions of article () of the Constitution and section  of the Labour Code, inasmuch as the office of the Comptroller-General arrogates to itself a power of classification which those provisions confer exclusively on the Ministries of Labour and Social Security, National Defence and Economic Affairs, and Public Works and Reconstruction.
.Under article () of the Constitution, the law governs the establishment of  procedures for determining the corporations or enterprises whose workers will be covered by the prohibition' on strikes, which applies to  persons employed in corporations or enterprises, whatever their nature, purpose or function, which provide public utility services or services the stoppage of which would cause serious damage to public health, the economy, public supplies or national security'  However, in compliance with the Constitution, section  of the Labour Code provides that the corporations and enterprises whose workers are not entitled to strike shall be determined through a classification undertaken in July each year by the Ministries of Labour and Social Security, National Defence and Economic Affairs, and Public Works and Reconstruction, taking the form of an administrative act issuing a joint decision.
.Contrary to the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, whose meaning and scope can be deduced unambiguously from the standards concerned without there being any area of dispute in national doctrine, the ruling under challenge differentiates incorrectly and injudiciously between enterprises referred to in clause (a) of that section and those covered by clause (b). It is incorrect because article () of the Constitution makes no distinction between both situations, and subjects all enterprises to the legal classification procedure established in section  of the Labour Code. In fact, it commits a serious error because it violates the Constitution by not complying with legal procedures and by making a distinction not provided for therein in blatant violation of the terms of the final paragraph of section , according to which any classification relating to an enterprise in one of the situations described shall be undertaken exclusively by the three ministries referred to above.
.The classification procedure involves  appraising or determining the qualities and circumstances of a person or thing' and leads to the issuing of a judgement or opinion. In the present case, it is a question of determining whether a specific enterprise provides a public utility service such as to authorize it to deny its workers the right to strike. There is no legislation which defines specific enterprises as being engaged in the provision of public utility services, the latter concept having no precise legal definition. Article () establishes a distinction between the situation of state and municipal officials and that of workers covered by the second part of the fifth paragraph of article (), namely workers in the enterprises described in both clauses of section  of the Labour Code.
.The classification procedure only applies to corporations or enterprises which provide public utility services or those the stoppage of which would cause serious damage to public health, the economy, public supplies or national security. It does not apply to state or municipal officials, since in this case there is nothing to classify, their status being assigned objectively by law. However, in the case of public utility companies, classification ' the process whereby the provision of public utility services is deemed to be the core function of the enterprise ' is indispensable. Firstly, because it has to be determined that the service provided is a public utility service; secondly, it must be established that the enterprise is equipped in operational terms for providing this service. Finally and most importantly, it is essential to analyse whether or not the exercise of the right to strike jeopardizes the functioning of the public utility service.
.Section  of the Labour Code fully confirms the above, inasmuch as it explicitly refers to the situation in which an essential service ' synonymous with a public utility service ' is crippled by a strike, this being one of the prerequisites for the formation of emergency teams. The same may be said regarding the provisions of section  concerning the possibility of ordering the resumption of work in an enterprise crippled by a strike or lock-out.
.Hence, it cannot be claimed that merely assigning the status of enterprise, which provides an essential service or public utility service, automatically imposes the obligation to deprive the workers of their right to strike. If this was the case, as with the ruling issued by the office of the Comptroller-General, it would overstep clear provisions of law such as those already mentioned which allow the possibility that workers providing a public utility service can go on strike. Hence, the classification to be undertaken by the ministries becomes essential, not only because it is required by section  but also because it forms part of the regulations governing collective bargaining, which do not call for mechanical classification but for case-by-case consideration which analyses the various aspects concerned.
.The said classification ' which in some form comes within the competence of the office of the Comptroller-General ' therefore presupposes an analysis of each specific case rather than a process of objectification. The actual ruling under challenge bears this out, since in reaching the conclusion which gives rise to the appeal it undertakes precisely a classification process for which it has no competence, since that process belongs exclusively to the competence of the ministries referred to above.
.It is possible that the classification undertaken by the ministries in the exercise of their legal duties and their exclusive competence, whereby sanitation company workers are not included, appears erroneous or inconvenient to the Comptroller-General. But this does not justify the ruling issued, since it is not for the Comptroller-General to enter into issues of substance but only to intervene in the sphere of legality. According to the complainants, it is quite clear that the ministries cannot have breached the law since they merely complied with section  of the Labour Code in deciding which enterprises must be deemed to be engaged in the provision of public utility services",-1,2008,Chile
92,"for the purposes of restricting the right to strike.
.If the opposite was considered to be the case, i.e. that this was an illegal situation, it is unclear why the Comptroller-General limits the effects of the ruling to sanitation companies in view of the existence of many other enterprises that provide public utility services in areas such as hospitals, transport and communications which have not been included in the scope of decisions issued to implement section . The prohibitions imposed by the legislation on the right to strike are clearly directed at the workers. What the legislation seeks is to prevent a work stoppage from affecting the operations of enterprises which provide essential services. Hence, there has to be a necessary and direct causal link between stoppages arising from workers' exercise of their right to strike and the functioning of essential services provided by the company. If there is no such link, there is no reason to limit the right to strike, since to do so would be to defeat the purpose of the legal provisions whose application is restrictive.
.In the opinion of the complainants, in the context of respect of fundamental social rights, the fact that the enterprise provides a public utility service is not sufficient in itself for the right to strike to be prohibited; it is also necessary to establish whether or not the stoppage arising from a strike actually jeopardizes the provision of the essential service. In the present case, in the exercise of its powers of classification deriving from section  of the Labour Code, the authority has considered with good reason that there is no justification for depriving sanitation company workers of their right to strike, since the regulations on collective bargaining offer other means of meeting public welfare requirements in relation to providing sanitation services. In other words, it considered that this case does not involve the criterion of necessity, resulting in the restriction of the fundamental right being essential in order to achieve the legitimate end, with no easier solution available.
.It is strange that the multinationals which operate the sanitation companies are quick to raise the alarm concerning the essential nature of their services for protecting people s lives and health but have no hesitation in cutting off drinking water supplies to people who fall behind in the payment of their bills because of financial problems.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that in , by means of Decision No.  of the Ministries of Defence, Economic Affairs, Labour and Social Security and in response to the proceedings undertaken by the Committee on Freedom of Association in Case No. , sanitation company workers were exempted from the prohibition on going on strike which had been in force until then. The office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, exercising the powers assigned to it by the Chilean Constitution, specifically article , first paragraph thereof, declared the Government s decision to be illegal, inasmuch as it deemed sanitation companies to provide essential services.
.The Government indicates that the fifth and final paragraphs of article () of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile state:  Workers have the right to collective bargaining in the enterprise where they work, except in cases where the law expressly prohibits negotiation. The law shall establish methods of collective bargaining and appropriate procedures for achieving a fair and peaceful outcome. The law shall indicate the cases in which collective bargaining shall be subject to compulsory arbitration, and this shall come within the competence of special tribunals of experts whose structure and powers shall be established by law. State and municipal officials shall not have the right to strike. The same shall apply to persons who work in corporations or enterprises, whatever their nature, purpose or function, which provide public utility services or services the stoppage of which would cause serious damage to public health, the economy, public supplies or national security. The law shall establish the procedures for determining the corporations or enterprises whose workers will be covered by the prohibition laid down by this paragraph.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government adds that, in accordance with the explicit provisions of the Chilean Constitution, section  of the Chilean Labour Code states:  Workers in enterprises which provide (a) public utility services or (b) services the stoppage of which would cause serious damage to public health, public supplies, the economy or national security, shall not have the right to strike.' The fifth paragraph of this section states:  In the cases enumerated in this section, if no direct agreement can be achieved between the parties to collective bargaining, compulsory arbitration shall take place in accordance with the provisions of the law. Whether or not one of the situations referred to in the previous paragraph applies to the enterprise concerned shall be decided by a classification effected in July each year resulting in a joint decision of the Ministries of Labour and Social Security, National Defence and Economic Affairs, and Public Works and Reconstruction.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In line with the abovementioned principles, the office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, by means of the abovementioned ruling, points out that the Chilean Labour Code, after making a distinction between the two scenarios referred to above, establishes a mechanism for determining the criteria for imposing the strike prohibition, but only in relation to the scenario described in section (b) and not in relation to enterprises which provide public utility services. It adds that,  account must therefore be taken of the fact that this unequal treatment with regard to entities which provide public utility services, both in the Constitution and in the Labour Code, is based on the fact that the latter constitute the most fundamental and essential services for meeting minimum public welfare requirements, and so it is consistent with this that the strike prohibition should apply without the need for administrative justification of the possible effects of any stoppage, as established in law with regard to the situation described in section (b)' 
.The Government recognizes that the present dispute relates to the definition of the indeterminate legal concept of  public utility'  which under the terms of the law refers to the classification undertaken by the Ministries of Labour and Social Security, National Defence and Economic Affairs, and Public Works and Reconstruction and issued in a joint decision. Nevertheless, there is nothing established in Chilean law to prevent the office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, from declaring an act of the administration to be illegal. To conclude otherwise would imply that certain acts of the administration are considered exempt from the controls on legality undertaken by the office of the Comptroller-General and this would seriously damage the institutional system in Chile.
.As regards the indefinite legal concept of  public utility'  although neither the Constitution nor the Labour Code states that economic activities include such services, leaving the classification to the abovementioned ministries, it is the ILO Committee of Experts which in  defined essential services as  services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population'  The Committee on Freedom of Association has provided a more detailed definition, stating that the essential services in which the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited include the hospital sector, electricity services, telephone services, air traffic control and water supply services. The strict application of this list is reinforced by the fact that the Committee on Freedom of Association excluded some of the activities considered previously, maintaining only those which meet the definition of essential services in the strict sense. While not establishing a concept, the General Sanitation Services Act also establishes that these provide public utility services, as referred to by article () of the Constitution.
.Thus, the Committee on Freedom of Association establishes that the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited in the public service or in essential services  in so far as a strike there could cause serious hardship to the national community and provided that the limitations are accompanied by certain compensatory guarantees'  In compliance with the above, the Government of Chile has introduced compensatory guarantees through compulsory arbitration in section  of the Labour Code, which provides that, in the cases it refers to, if no direct agreement is reached between the parties to collective bargaining, compulsory arbitration shall apply in accordance with the terms of the law. Hence, the Chilean legislature never had any intention to withhold the right to strike from certain sectors but, on the contrary, it established a guarantee to compensate for the right to strike and offers guarantees of independent, impartial and speedy action in which the parties can intervene at all stages, in order to ensure that the labour rights of workers affected by this restriction are not undermined.
.It is in this context, and in view of the decision referred to above, that the Ministries of",-1,2008,Chile
93,"Economic Affairs, Public Works and Reconstruction, Labour and Social Security and National Defence, the National Federation of Sanitation Workers (FENATRAOS), Esval SA Workers' Union No. , the workers of Aguas Antofagasta II Region, various unions from Aguas Andina SA and Aguas Cordillera SA, the ESSMET SA Workers' Union, the Essal SA Union of Sanitation Professionals and Professional Technicians and the Aguas El Altiplano Union of Professionals and Technicians, in their efforts to defend and extend strike coverage to at least some sanitation company workers, requested the office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic to review Ruling No.  of .
.In this request for review, the ministries point out that under the provisions of article () of the Constitution the right to strike can be limited with respect to workers employed in corporations or enterprises ' whatever the nature, purpose or function of the latter ' which provide public utility services and that therefore it is a prohibition which is laid down with respect to the worker and not to the entities that provide the said services. Hence, it is necessary to provide an annual classification stating which entities will be covered by the decision issued by the three ministries. They reiterate that the Constitution, in laying down such a limitation, considers the worker and not the enterprise as a whole, which is in line with the need to apply the restrictions on strikes to the employees who are strictly necessary for ensuring the provision of the essential service. Moreover, they explain that the sanitation companies do not necessarily provide public services directly but do so through subcontracting.
.With regard to the aforementioned situation, the office of the Comptroller-General argues that it is not in keeping with the provisions of article () of the Constitution to seek on the basis of generic considerations to exclude certain enterprises that provide public utility services from the list contained in the decision issued by the three ministries, or to include some and not others. It claims that this is in line with the content of the presentations, regarding the need to apply the restrictions on strikes to the employees who are strictly necessary for ensuring the provision of the essential service or to limit it only to operational staff, since the provisions of the Constitution establish such limitations for all persons working in enterprises of this kind. It argues that for such reasons the authority has no power to make distinctions with a view to excluding certain public utility enterprises from the scope of the decision of the three ministries on account of the fact that such enterprises use subcontracting to perform part of their work.
.Finally, the Government, through arduous legislative and administrative work, has striven to ensure strict compliance with the ILO Conventions. Accordingly, the Conventions, Recommendations and abundant doctrine originating from the ILO have been fully incorporated into Chilean law, in the sense that its labour legislation, independent of its hierarchy, has to be in conformity with the ILO Conventions, Recommendations, principles and doctrine. The Government, in the context of the independence of the state authorities and respecting the obligation  not to exercise judicial functions, plead pending cases, revise the foundations or content of decisions or reopen lapsed cases'  undertakes to keep the Committee on Freedom of Association informed of the progress made on the issues still pending in this matter.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization challenges Ruling No.  of  of the office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, which considers that sanitation companies provide essential services and that sanitation service providers should be included in the list of entities whose workers cannot go on strike (the complainant recalls that the administrative authority had exempted sanitation company workers from the strike prohibition).
.In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () in , by means of Decision No.  of the Ministries of Defence, Labour and Social Security and in response to the examination of Case No.  by the Committee on Freedom of Association, sanitation company workers were exempted from the prohibition on going on strike which had been in force until then; () the office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, exercising the powers conferred on it by the Chilean Constitution, declared illegal the government decision, on the basis that it considered sanitation companies provided essential services; () the dispute in question is connected with classification relating to the indeterminate legal concept of public utility, and such classification entails a joint decision issued by the Ministries of Labour and Social Security, National Defence, and Economic Affairs, Public Works and Reconstruction, but there is still nothing in the legislation to prevent the office of the Comptroller-General, exercising its constitutional powers, from declaring an act of the administration illegal; () to conclude otherwise would imply that certain acts of the administration are considered exempt from the controls on legality undertaken by the office of the Comptroller-General, and this would thus seriously damage the institutional system; () the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Public Works and Reconstruction, Labour and Social Security, and National Defence, FENATRAOS and other workers' organizations requested the office of the Comptroller-General to review Ruling No.  of  and the office indicated that it was not in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution to seek, on the basis of generic considerations, to exclude specific enterprises that provide public utility services from the list contained in Decision No. , or to include some and not others; () compensatory guarantees have been established through compulsory arbitration, as indicated by the Committee in relation to the public service or in essential services; and () in the context of the independence of the state authorities, the Government undertakes to keep the Committee informed of progress made on the issues still pending in this matter.
.Firstly, the Committee recalls that it has already had occasion to examine allegations concerning the prohibition of the right to strike imposed on sanitation workers in Chile [see th Report, Case No. , paras ' ], and its conclusions included the following:
.The Committee notes that the Government states that water supply services are an essential service.
.The Committee recalls that  the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population)' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.The Committee also recalls that water supply services are an essential service where the right to strike may be prohibited with adequate protection to compensate for this limitation [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. The Committee notes, however, that the Government states that further investigation is needed as regards the claim presented by the complainants, in which the different sections or duties that are carried out within the company be defined so that only those workers who are directly linked to the provision of the essential service be subjected to the prohibition of the right to strike; that investigation shall be carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security as soon as possible. The Committee appreciates and encourages this initiative; it hopes that this investigation will be carried out very shortly and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In this regard, the Committee appreciates the statements from the Government and the complainant to the effect that further to the examination of Case No.  concerning the prohibition of the right to strike not only on sanitation workers who are providing an essential service but also on those who are involved in areas that are clearly separate from the provision of essential services, such as administrative tasks, legal advice, design projects, planning, construction and works inspection, information technology and others, the Government, by means of Decision No. , exempted sanitation company workers from the prohibition on strikes which had been in force until then.
.The Committee notes, however, that the office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic revoked the abovementioned decision of the administrative authority, since there were incompatibilities with the provisions of the Constitution of Chile, and that according to the Government the workers thus excluded from the right to strike have compensatory guarantees. This being the case, observing that the Government states that, in the context of the independence of the state authorities, it undertakes to inform the Committee of progress made on the issues still pending in this matter and, taking into consideration the fact that the case evokes complex legal questions, including constitutional ones, the Committee submits this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee submits this",-1,2008,Chile
94,case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.,-1,2008,Chile
95,".In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee expects to receive without delay information from the Government on the status of legal proceedings against those arrested during the search, sanctioned by judicial order, of the home of a union member, Mr Juan Carlos Miranda Zamora and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera (who, according to the complainants, have not been charged), and as to whether other union leaders or members have been arrested and charged in relation to the strike carried out by the CTC between  June and  August , and, if so, requests that the Government provide information on the charges brought against them and the current status of the legal proceedings. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to supply information as to whether any legal action has been initiated in respect of the violent acts.(b) The Committee expects to receive without delay information from the Government on the specific facts of the cases and the reasons given for beginning proceedings to remove the union leaders Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo, as well as on the outcome of these proceedings.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to promote an agreement between CODELCO and the CTC so that the CTC s representatives can gain access to workplaces or nearby areas to pursue their union activities, without compromising the functioning of the enterprise and with full due consideration for the safety of workers and of the mine and in accordance with national law. Furthermore, noting that the Government has only reported that Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera is employed by a contracting enterprise that provides services to CODELCO, the Committee requests the Government to indicate without delay whether the other union leaders mentioned in the complaint have been refused work.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that there are no records in the registry of the Public Ministry of Juan Carlos Miranda or of Francisco Javier Daz Herrera, and adds that the latter is currently working for a company that provides services for CODELCO and is president of the union at that company. The Committee notes this information.
.The Government also states that during the strike in , a number of workers and trade unionists were convicted of offences but the great majority of them had their sentences suspended. The offences were those of damage to property, theft, threats, public disorder, or obstruction of access to the mine. The Committee notes this information.
.As regards the proceedings to strip certain union officials of trade union immunity (which would permit their dismissal), the Government states that the judicial authority rejected the application to remove immunity from Emilio Zrate and Patricio Rocco, and that neither the company of Luis Garrido Garrido nor that of Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo applied to the judicial authority to remove their immunity. The Committee notes this information.
.With regard to Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara and Viviana Andrea Abud Flores, the Government states that case no.  concerning removal of immunity is currently before the lower-level Labour Court of Rancagua According to the employer (the contracting enterprise Mc Lean), on  June , at around . a.m. at the CODELCO facilities in the Coln Alto sector, the individuals in question interfered with the free passage of vehicles and persons by placing themselves underneath workers' buses at the head of the convoy headed for the mine, thereby preventing  buses carrying around , workers from CODELCO and contracting enterprises from getting to the mine, seriously endangering their own lives and causing major losses to the El Teniente division. As a result of these actions, the company Mc Lean applied to have the individuals in question stripped of their immunity for contravening section , paragraph , of the Labour Code (acts or omissions or reckless actions that affect the safety or functioning of the establishment, the safety and activity of the workers, or their health). The Government adds that on  March , a lower court ruling agreed to the lifting of the workers' immunity and thus authorized the employer to dismiss them. On  April , the workers lodged an appeal against that ruling, which is still pending. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the appeal.
.As regards the right of union officials to visit workplaces, the Government states that according to Chilean labour legislation, trade union officials employed at a contracting enterprise may visit dependent areas of the main contractor provided that members of the union are employed at those sites and the purpose of the visit is trade union activity. Thus, section  of the Labour Code provides that:  Ordinary or extraordinary meetings of trade union organizations shall be held in any union premises outside working hours and shall have the purpose of enabling their members to discuss matters of relevance at the entity in question ... They shall, however, be entitled to hold meetings during working hours if they have been agreed in advance with the employer or employer s representative.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government adds that as a result of the legal framework described above, if one or more of the union officials in question work normally for a contracting company and have duly authorized passes or cards, they can visit production areas in the various subsidiary divisions of the company, as does any worker performing his duties, in strict compliance with safety and health requirements, and can carry on their trade union functions within the terms of section  of the Labour Code. On the other hand, if the union officials in question are not providing actual services in their respective enterprise, or if the civil or commercial contract between the contracting enterprise and the principal contractor enterprise has expired and they consequently no longer have normal authorization to enter the workplace, CODELCO, in order to protect the health and safety of persons and the security of its facilities, as required by section  of the Labour Code, shall authorize admission to workplace provided that authorization is sought in advance. In accordance with section -E of the Labour Code, the principal contractor has the obligation, together with the contracting company, to adopt any measures needed to protect the lives and health of subcontracted workers at the workplaces in question.
.In this context, the Government goes on to state that the mining enterprise CODELCO has implemented a vigorous and efficient system of health, safety and protection at the workplace, including, among others, the provision according to which every person seeking admission to work including the CODELCO union officials and those of the corresponding contracting enterprise, must be in possession of respective cards or passes that are issued following a rigorous administrative procedure, wherever there is restricted access to the industrial areas or other dependent areas of CODELCO. The Government draws attention to the fact that in accordance with its legal prerogatives, the National Labour Directorate has issued an order concerning access to the company for trade union officials.
.On that basis, and in accordance with the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO s Governing Body, the prevailing national and international labour standards in the area of freedom of association and occupational safety and health, given the diversity of labour rights which converge in this area, and with a view to ensuring the full implementation and respect for workers' rights, trade union activities at CODELCO work sites can be carried out under the following conditions: () there must be workers at the site in question who are members of the union and represented by the officials seeking access to the workplace, a fact which must be certified by the competent labour inspector; () where union officials are not employed at the site or in the activities concerned, they must give advance notice to CODELCO of the date, time and reasons for the visit; () the visitors must adhere to the applicable company rules, especially as regards entry to restricted areas; and () the trade union activity within the company s dependent areas must not entail any disruption to the normal processes of work, meals, rest and recreation of workers employed there, above all of those who are not union members.
.The Committee notes this information.
.As regards the Committee s question as to whether the union officials have been refused work, the Government, in the context of requests made for such information, has received no new information regarding the circumstances of alleged refusals involving any official named in the complaint. Since the complainant organizations have not provided any information on this question, the Committee will not pursue its examination.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in May June  and submitted an interim",1,2007,Chile
96,"report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.Subsequently, the Government sent new observations in a communication dated  November .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.During its last examination of the case, in May June , the Committee made the following recommendations on the outstanding issues [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on any proceedings against the two workers arrested during the search, sanctioned by judicial order, of the home of a member of the union, Mr Juan Carlos Miranda Zamora and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera (who, according to the complainants, were not charged) and whether other union leaders or members have been arrested and charged in relation to the strike carried out by the CTC between  June and  August , and, if so, that it provide information on the charges brought and the current status of any legal proceedings. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on whether any legal action has been brought in respect of these violent events.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure compliance with the agreement concluded on  August  between CODELCO, the subcontracting enterprises and the CTC. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the specific facts of the cases and the reasons given for beginning proceedings to remove the union leaders Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo, and on the outcome of these proceedings.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to promote an agreement between CODELCO and the CTC so that the CTC s representatives can gain access to workplaces to pursue their union activities, without compromising the functioning of the enterprise. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to investigate the allegation that the union leaders mentioned in the complaint have been refused work and to keep it informed in this regard.
.It its communication of  November , the Government states that it transmitted the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association in this case to the enterprise CODELCO. CODELCO has provided information in response.
.With regard to the status of legal proceedings against Mr Juan Carlos Miranda and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera, who are alleged to have been detained during a house search sanctioned by judicial order, the Government states that it has no information on the matter, but undertakes to provide any information relating to the case as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the above, Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera is currently working for a contracting enterprise that provides services to CODELCO s Andean division.
.Concerning the Framework Agreement signed on  August , the Government states that it has been fully implemented and that there are no administrative or legal complaints relating to it. The Government points out that CODELCO is not the employer of those who work for the contracting enterprises that provide it with labour or services, using their own staff, on their own account, at their own risk, and under their authority (in accordance with the provisions of section -A of the Labour Code). Nevertheless, with the aim of ensuring that the commitments assumed by the contracting enterprises in the aforementioned Framework Agreement are fulfilled in due time, CODELCO has resolved to include the fulfilment of the commitments acquired by contracting enterprises as employers, as a requirement in its tendering procedures and documents, as reflected in the Agreement. The Government adds that the contracting enterprises that provide services to CODELCO have fulfilled and are fulfilling the terms agreed with their respective workers.
.With respect to the removal proceedings referred to in the Committee s report, the Government states that it has no information on the current status of the proceedings. The Government undertakes to report on this matter as soon as possible once it has any relevant information.
.With regard to access by union leaders to the premises of CODELCO, and a possible agreement between it and the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) to enable trade union representatives from contracting enterprises to enter workplaces in order to pursue their trade union activities, without compromising the functioning of the enterprise, the Government reiterates that union leaders from the CTC are not employed by CODELCO but by contracting enterprises that have provided or could provide services to the main enterprise under tendering procedures that may arise. This being the case, if one or more leaders usually work for their contracting employer at sites or workplaces belonging to CODELCO, and if they possess the duly authorized passes or cards, they may enter the industrial areas in which they perform contractual services.
.The Government adds that, notwithstanding the above, under Chilean labour legislation, trade union leaders from a contracting enterprise may enter sites or workplaces operating within dependencies of a main enterprise, only if members of their unions work there and if the purpose of visiting a particular site or workplace is to carry out trade union activities, always in strict compliance with the safety standards and subject to the prior coordination required for the workplaces in question. On this last point, the Government underlines that there is no free access to industrial areas and other dependencies of CODELCO s divisions, inasmuch as the access is regulated by the legal imperative to safeguard the health and physical integrity of persons and the safety of installations, as prescribed by section () of the Labour Code:  The employer shall be obliged to take the measures necessary to effectively protect the life and health of workers, maintaining appropriate health and safety conditions in workplaces, as well as the equipment necessary to prevent occupational accidents and diseases.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government in relation to the recommendations that it made in its previous examination of the case at its meeting in May June . The Committee notes the Government s statement that according to the enterprise the Framework Agreement signed on  August , has been fully implemented and that there are no administrative or legal complaints relating to it; the Government also points out that CODELCO is not the employer of those who work for the contracting enterprises that provide it with labour or services, using their own staff, on their own account, at their own risk, and under their own authority (in accordance with the provisions of section -A of the Labour Code); nevertheless, with the aim of ensuring that the commitments assumed by the contracting enterprises in the aforementioned Framework Agreement are fulfilled in due time, CODELCO has resolved to include the fulfilment of the commitments acquired by contracting enterprises as employers, as a requirement in its tendering procedures and documents, as reflected in the Agreement. According to the Government, the contracting enterprises that provide services to CODELCO have fulfilled and are fulfilling the terms agreed with their respective workers.
.With respect to the status of legal proceedings against Mr Juan Carlos Miranda and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera, who are alleged to have been detained during a search, sanctioned by judicial order, of the home of a union member, and with respect to developments in and the results of the removal proceedings against union the leaders Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that it has no information on the issues and undertakes to provide any information as soon as possible. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations and expects to receive the information requested without delay. The Committee reiterates its request to the Government to report on whether legal proceedings have been initiated in respect of the violent acts during a lawful strike between  June and  August , mentioned in the complaint.
.As regards the recommendation concerning access by union leaders to workplaces at the enterprise and a possible agreement between the latter and the CTC to enable trade union representatives from contracting enterprises to enter workplaces in order to pursue their trade union activities, without compromising the functioning of the enterprise, the Committee notes that the Government underlines the fact that union leaders from the CTC are not employed by the enterprise but by contracting enterprises that have provided or could provide services to the main enterprise under tendering procedures that may arise. Therefore, if one or more leaders usually work for their contracting employer at sites or workplaces belonging to the enterprise, and if they possess the duly authorized passes or cards, they",1,2007,Chile
97,"may enter the industrial areas in which they perform contractual services. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, under Chilean labour legislation, trade union leaders from a contracting enterprise may enter sites or workplaces operating within dependencies of a main enterprise, only if members of their unions work there and if the purpose of visiting a particular site or workplace is to carry out trade union activities, always in strict compliance with the safety standards and subject to the prior coordination required for the workplaces in question. In particular, in the case of a mining enterprise, there is no free access, as it must be guaranteed that the health of persons and the safety of installations are safeguarded, as laid down in the Labour Code. Taking full account of these specific circumstances relating to the enterprise, the Committee reiterates its previous recommendation concerning the promotion of an agreement between the enterprise and the CTC trade union on access by CTC representatives to workplaces or nearby areas, taking full due account of the safety of workers and the mine and in accordance with national law.
.Lastly, the Committee had requested the Government to investigate the allegation that the union leaders mentioned in the complaint had been refused work, and to keep it informed in this regard. On this matter, the Committee notes that the Government has only reported that trade union member Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera is currently employed by a contracting enterprise that provides services to the Andean division of CODELCO. The Committee requests the Government to indicate without delay whether the other union leaders mentioned in the complaint have been refused work.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expects to receive without delay information from the Government on the status of legal proceedings against those arrested during the search, sanctioned by judicial order, of the home of a union member, Mr Juan Carlos Miranda Zamora and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera (who, according to the complainants, have not been charged), and as to whether other union leaders or members have been arrested and charged in relation to the strike carried out by the CTC between  June and  August , and, if so, requests that the Government provide information on the charges brought against them and the current status of the legal proceedings. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to supply information as to whether any legal action has been initiated in respect of the violent acts.(b) The Committee expects to receive without delay information from the Government on the specific facts of the cases and the reasons given for beginning proceedings to remove the union leaders Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo, as well as on the outcome of these proceedings.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to promote an agreement between CODELCO and the CTC so that the CTC s representatives can gain access to workplaces or nearby areas to pursue their union activities, without compromising the functioning of the enterprise and with full due consideration for the safety of workers and of the mine and in accordance with national law. Furthermore, noting that the Government has only reported that Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera is employed by a contracting enterprise that provides services to CODELCO, the Committee requests the Government to indicate without delay whether the other union leaders mentioned in the complaint have been refused work.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) and the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) of November . The CTC subsequently sent new allegations in a communication of November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications of January and February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of November , the CTC and the CUT state that workers belonging to the CTC are those workers in a subordinate and dependent relationship with the state enterprise CODELCO, which originated from the promulgation of the constitutional reform nationalizing copper in July . The National Copper Corporation of Chile, as it is now known, was established by a decree of  April  and is the largest state enterprise in Chile. Approximately  contracting enterprises subcontract some , workers who fulfil permanent and temporary roles for the main enterprise, CODELCO Chile.
.The CTC is a properly constituted trade union organization that has enjoyed legal personality since its by-laws were deposited with the Labour Inspectorate. It is composed of trade union organizations such as federations and primary organizations, all of which freely adopt their own by-laws and proceed to elect trade union leaders. The CTC maintained that it was necessary for CODELCO to listen and respond to workers' labour complaints, but its efforts proved useless. The workers it represents therefore voted on and approved legal strike action on  June , which was extended until  August . During the strike, the State took severe action against freedom of association.
.The complainants state that during collective bargaining, actions were identified on the part of the state enterprise CODELCO and the State of Chile itself, through its agents, that constituted anti-union or unfair practices. Illegal arrests, detention, excessive use of public force, trespass, breach of private communications and, in general, infringement of fundamental rights, both labour-related and general, all occurred. The state apparatus behaved excessively throughout towards workers who were struggling to improve their working conditions.
.The CTC denounced the Chilean national police for the excessive force used in suppressing demonstrations by workers outside the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Los Andes. To date, however, no reply has been received, no investigation is under way, no legal proceedings have been brought, and no one has been charged, despite the following serious complaints having been made: () house searches on the verbal orders of a supervisory judge. A group of police officers entered the home of a worker belonging to the CTC and proceeded to use unnecessary force to break furniture and other items in the worker s home, remaining there for more than an hour; and () complaints that workers belonging to the CTC who were legitimately exercising their rights, as guaranteed in the Constitution and in law, were suppressed by the national police, who used force in an unnecessary manner in suppressing the workers, despite the fact that they were withdrawing peacefully from the area.
.During this suppression of workers, some  workers were detained. The local Office of the Public Prosecutor later released all the workers because it considered that there were no grounds for bringing them before the Supervisory Court. In addition, three workers were injured. They were taken to the local hospital, where the injuries suffered were identified as direct consequences of the illegal action of the national police on the day of the events.
.The state enterprise made use of the measures granted to it by the State itself to break up the movement, for example by falsely making it seem as if the dispute had been concluded, when in fact it had simply invented pseudo-negotiations with another group of subcontracted workers, with whom it was alleged to have reached an agreement. The complainants state that that group of workers never negotiated with the state enterprise, nor did they ever declare or take strike action or join the CTC s strike. This amounted to an act of bad faith that substantially influenced the course of negotiations taking place at the time and made it seem, including to workers, that the dispute was over. The media immediately broadcast that fact, generating confusion within and outside the CTC. It has been established in national judicial jurisprudence that the spreading of untruthful information during the collective bargaining process that influences the outcome of collective bargaining constitutes an act of bad faith that obstructs collective bargaining.
.The complainants allege that workers, especially trade union directors from the confederation, federations and primary unions affiliated to the CTC, have been directly and indirectly prevented from entering their workplaces. Direct prevention has occurred through the dismissal of workers who exercised their right to strike. Threats of dismissal were also made against all workers who had participated in collective bargaining.
.Indirect prevention was undertaken through the agents of the State, i.e. the police, criminal prosecutors and the criminal courts, which acted together, even violating fundamental rights such as honour, privacy and the inviolability of private communications, with the intention of criminalizing the strike and its leaders. Repressive state apparatus, such as the national police, actually entered members' homes and, furthermore, with authorization from the criminal courts, proceeded to search homes, persecute workers and union leaders",-1,2007,Chile
98,"and intercept calls on mobile and fixed telephone lines in criminal cases which the Public Ministry itself later decided not to pursue. This is of vital importance as it illustrates that the actions of these bodies were not motivated by legal proceedings but, quite the contrary, were intended solely to intimidate workers and leaders and to break up the trade union organization. The complainants state that a specific example of this occurred in the Los Andes Division, where the Criminal Supervisory Court, at the request of the Public Ministry, gave a verbal authorization to the police to search the home of one member, where picketers were supposed to be in hiding. On that occasion, the national police entered and remained in the dwelling for more than two hours, destroying everything in their path, arresting two workers on the evidence of three stones which were meant to have been found in the house they searched and which the Public Ministry subsequently used to charge the workers with offences dreamt up by the prosecutor. The Supervisory Court, presided over by the same judge who had issued the verbal instruction, and based solely on the evidence of the  three stones'  requested immediate proceedings for public disorder against one of the workers arrested at the house, but, when the time came for the hearing, the proceedings were dropped, which demonstrates that the sole purpose was to intimidate workers so that they would stop pursuing their legitimate demands.
.The State of Chile has behaved in a manner which threatens freedom of association. The Government stated, after scant consideration and decision-making, that the dispute should be resolved by the subcontracting enterprises with those workers who belong to the CTC and that the state enterprise CODELCO is autonomous in its decision-making.
.The complainants report that the state enterprise and the contracting and subcontracting enterprises are organized through a conglomerate, holding or economic unit which, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, constitutes an enterprise for employment purposes. This is the case for several reasons: (a) the state enterprise CODELCO occupies a dominant position over the contracting and subcontracting enterprises, to the point that it constitutes a monopoly position that cannot be reversed by the contracting and subcontracting enterprises; and (b) formally subcontracted workers fulfil the same roles as workers contracted directly by CODELCO.
.The subcontracted workers fulfil permanent roles in the main enterprise and it is the main enterprise that issues orders, meaning that the subordinate and dependent relationship is definitely with the state enterprise and not with the contracting or subcontracting enterprises. These enterprises would hardly be able to impose their decisions on the management of workers and their enterprises if they were in fact puppet enterprises controlled by the state enterprise. By simulating contracting, the existence of an economic unit can be observed. It is the state enterprise itself that appoints contracting and subcontracting enterprises to contract workers and make them available to the state enterprise to fulfil their respective functions.
.On  August , the state enterprise CODELCO and the subcontracting enterprises signed the Framework Agreement between CODELCO Chile, contracting enterprises and the CTC. This instrument sets out a series of obligations on the state enterprise, among which are: payment of a bonus equivalent to US$, to the benefit of all contracting workers working for CODELCO Chile; payment of eight days' wages for the days of the strike, an amount of US$, for the remaining days and the provision of wage advances to cover the remaining strike days; the reinstatement of workers dismissed for having participated in the legal strike; and a commitment to refrain from dismissals in reprisal for the strike. The complainants state that the state enterprise has not fully complied with these obligations. Even after the strike, the state enterprise has continued to behave in a manner that constitutes anti-union practice, specifically:' contracting workers are excluded from the benefits obtained, which contradicts the letter and spirit of the Agreement, which was negotiated at all times on behalf of all contracting workers;' economic benefits have been paid first to workers not participating in the strike and payments to workers currently on strike have been delayed without cause. This was intended to encourage workers to leave the CTC;' at present there are a significant number of workers who have not received any economic benefit. These workers mostly belong to highly mobilized groups, which clearly constitutes an act of reprisal against them;' the wage benefits intended to cover the unpaid strike days have not been paid. This again applies to the most active workers, given that the rest have been paid all their wages, without such discrimination having any just cause;' the reinstatement of a significant number of workers, those who were most active in the strike, has not taken place;' with the aim of avoiding intervention by the Labour Directorate under the Subcontracting Act, once the strike had finished and the workers returned to work, their duties were changed on the pretext of complying with the law.
.Lastly, the complainants allege that the State has also failed to take charge of the labour dispute, which it could and should do through the National Labour Directorate in the following manner: () the labour inspectorate has the legal obligation to report any actions that constitute anti-union practices to the labour courts. Actions constituting anti-union practices have been described but, nevertheless, the labour inspectorate has not reported them; () the Labour Directorate offers a mediation system that aims to promote the resolution of collective labour disputes. In the dispute described, there was never the definite possibility of an offer of mediation by the Labour Directorate; and () violations of the Subcontracting Act No.  have been reported but to date no information has been received of any investigation reports.
.According to the complainants, there has been a violation of the  Constitution, which stipulates that all workers may declare a strike with the exception of civil servants employed by the state or municipalities, together with any persons employed in corporations or enterprises, whatever their nature, purpose or function, that provide public utility services or services whose stoppage would cause serious damage to health, the country s economy, public supply or national security. In addition, there have been violations of ILO Conventions Nos  and  and the Labour Code.
.In its communication of November , the CTC states that, once the Framework Agreement reached between CODELCO Chile, its contracting enterprises and the CTC had been signed, another series of anti-union practices began against the confederation, which took the form of persecution and harassment against union leaders and failure to pay the benefits set out in the Framework Agreement. This compliance failure was used by CODELCO Chile as a mechanism to destroy the confederation, based on the fact that it maintained in public that it had fully complied with its obligations, but in practice none of them were undertaken. CODELCO thus attempted to undermine relations with the primary organizations, who could not understand how the state enterprise could be broadcasting the fact that it was fully complying with the Framework Agreement while at the same time they were not receiving the benefits provided for therein.
.The CTC alleges that the contracting enterprises, threatened with losing their contracts with the state enterprise, took coordinated action to discredit and persecute the CTC. So, there was a resurgence in blacklisting, which was intended to impede the recruitment of workers linked to the confederation and, furthermore, to provoke the dismissal of those who still had contracts in force with any of these contracting enterprises. This was basically carried out by bringing legal actions to impede the functioning of the Confederation and to secure the removal of its various leaders.
.The CTC also alleges that requests for removals were made. CODELCO Chile coordinated with its contracting enterprises in order to request the removal of certain union leaders representing various divisions, with the aim of undermining representation at primary level. In this regard, requests were made to remove Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, the national director of the confederation, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo.
.The CTC alleges that blacklisting is being used to impede access to workplaces by some leaders (as in the case of Mr Andrs Leal Alavarado, national director of the CTC, and Mr Alvaro Guajardo in the holding division of CODELCO) and that there is a prohibition on giving work to others (as in the case of Mr Cristian Cuevas Zambrano, national president of the confederation, who has been obstructed and denied access to work since , and Mr Jorge Pea Maturana, national director of the CTC, who has been obstructed and denied access to work since ).
.In addition to the above, the state enterprise has introduced an entire procedure designed to avoid applying the Subcontracting Act.
.In its communication of January , the Government states that it has consulted CODELCO,",1,2007,Chile
99,"the National Labour Directorate, the national police and the Office of the Public Prosecutor. The Government recalls the complainants' statement that, given that CODELCO had not heeded the labour demands of the CTC, a strike was approved and took place. During the strike, according to the complainants, the state authorities are supposed to have carried out repressive actions in the form of illegal arrests, detention, excessive use of force and, in general, deprivation of fundamental rights, both general and labour-related. In this context, when the Secretariat-General of the national police was consulted by letter No.  of May , it stated, in a report dated  May , that, according to information obtained by the National Directorate for Security and Public Order of the National Police, no police procedures were identified which would have involved officers of the national police entering and searching trade union premises. For their part, on  July , with prior verbal authorization from the supervisory judge for Los Andes, institutional personnel entered and searched the property belonging to Mr Cristian Patricio Cabezas Carrasco, with the intention of arresting suspects Mr Juan Carlos Miranda Zamora and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera, both accused by witnesses of committing the offence of attacking a moving vehicle, resulting in damage, as provided for in section (h) of Traffic Act No. , in respect of bus PP-YU-, driven by Mr Rodrigo Antonio Pereira Lazcano, who was transporting workers who were on the way to pursue their usual duties at the mining site, the facts of which were communicated to the local Office of the Public Prosecutor for Los Andes in report No.  of  July .
.The Government states that, during collective bargaining and work stoppages, it is public knowledge that, in certain areas of the country, serious disruption of public order and damage to public and private property have been seen. These unlawful acts have prompted intervention by officers of the national police, with the aim of restoring the rule of law, leading to the arrests of some workers and union leaders. Individual reports of these events were produced describing actions that obstructed the normal ingress of workers and vehicles, stone throwing that resulted in injuries, cuts in the electricity supply, attacks on items belonging to fire-fighters that resulted in damage, threats against contracting workers who wanted to go about their normal duties and countless other actions which, given their severity and magnitude, warranted the intervention of officers of the national police.
.The Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile gives constitutional rank to the Armed Forces of Order and Security. Article  thereof states that  they consist solely of the national police and investigations police. They represent public force and they exist to enforce the law and guarantee public order and domestic public security, in the manner determined by their respective organic laws. The national police shall also form part of the armed forces, with the mission of guaranteeing institutional order in the Republic'  Furthermore, article , paragraph  of the Fundamental Charter guarantees  the assurance that the legal precepts which, mandated by the Constitution, regulate or complement the guarantees it provides, or limits them in those cases which authorized therein, shall not affect the essence of those rights, nor impose conditions, taxes or requirements that impede the free exercise thereof' 
.Furthermore, fundamental labour rights, respect for and exercise of which are guaranteed by the Chilean Constitution, as well as by international treaties ratified by Chile and incorporated into domestic legislation, must exist in harmony with other fundamental rights, which justifies the intervention by the national police. This intervention was not in any way intended to repress or affect the essence of the fundamental rights of the organization but, on the contrary, to guarantee fuller exercise of the rights of workers in all spheres, with full respect for the other guarantees enshrined in Chile s Fundamental Charter.
.As regards the allegation concerning the  obstruction of collective bargaining' by simulating pseudo-negotiations, CODELCO, in a report requested by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, states that  with respect to the accusation of bad faith, it should be noted that, despite there existing no employment relationship at all between the subcontracting workers and CODELCO, for which reason the enterprise is under no obligation whatsoever to negotiate with them, the Government of Chile and CODELCO, having respect for freedom of association, facilitated meetings between the parties, using dialogue, cooperation, good faith and equity as problem-solving tools'  Similarly, the Republic of Chile s domestic labour legislation does not in any way contravene international labour standards, nor the spirit thereof.
.With regard to the allegation that workers were directly prevented from entering their workplaces by means of their dismissal, CODELCO states that it had no opportunity or authority to undertake any of the actions described in the complaint, as it neither had nor has such powers. For its part, the National Labour Directorate has reported that the demonstrations were not carried out within the framework of collective bargaining under the country s Labour Code, and it was therefore not its responsibility to assume any of the roles it plays in such processes.
.Concerning the alleged indirect prevention or omissions by the State and its representatives, it should be noted that domestic legislation, by virtue of section  of the Labour Code, stipulates that overseeing the application of labour legislation is the responsibility of the Labour Directorate and states that  it is a decentralized public service, with legal personality and private property, which is subject to the supervision of the President of the Republic through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security' (Decree with Force of Law No.  of , Organic Law on the Labour Directorate). Bearing in mind the above, and in compliance with current legal standards in the field of labour, legislation calls on the Labour Directorate to intervene in such circumstances. The active intervention of the Directorate in question is outlined in report No.  of .
.Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the State of Chile has legislation on collective bargaining and freedom of association, the fruit of arduous legislative work over many years, which contains a series of reforms designed to strengthen freedom of association and the exercise of the right to strike, an effort which the Government of Chile has pursued since the early s. Act No.  of  definitively abolished those collective agreements that could be imposed by an employer, such that, in Chile, collective agreements can only be reached by a trade union or with a group of workers having a minimum level of organization. Certainly the regulations could be perfected, the more so if there remains a need for improvements stemming from recommendations made by the ILO supervisory bodies regarding certain important areas. In this regard, there is a presidential commitment to table a draft Act on improving the process of collective bargaining, taking into account the recommendations made by the ILO.
.With regard to  mediation systems'  the Labour Directorate, in a report requested on the subject, clarifies that it has formal mediation facilities, staffed by professionals dedicated exclusively to the service, which can be initiated at the request of parties and which are essentially voluntary. In this case, no requests to this effect were received.
.In its communication of February , the Government states that, taking fully into consideration the additions to the complaint made by the CTC and the accompanying observations from CODELCO, requested by the Government of Chile in letter No.  of  January , it has the following observations to make.
.With regard to the alleged contravention of the signed  Framework Agreement'  it must be clarified that, without prejudice to the statements made by the CTC in its written submission adding to its complaint, CODELCO, in a report requested on the issue, declares that  the contractors have complied with this manual of good practice in a full and satisfactory manner' 
.Given that contradictory statements have been made by CODELCO and workers for the contracting enterprises concerning the status of compliance with this Framework Agreement, and in the event that the declarations made by the complainant on this point are true, it does not follow that CODELCO should be accused of anti-union practices, as the employer, because it is not the employer of the complainant workers. In fact, work under a subcontracting arrangement is  that carried out under a contract of employment by a worker for an employer, termed the contractor or subcontractor, when, as a result of a contractual agreement, it undertakes to provide labour or services, on its own account, at its own risk and with workers dependent upon it, for a third natural or legal person directing the work, enterprise or service' 
.As can be seen from the above provision, an employment relationship in the legal arrangement of subcontracting exists only between a worker and the contracting or subcontracting employer. In this case, CODELCO has the status of  main",1,2007,Chile
100,"enterprise' or  third natural or legal person directing the work, enterprise or service'  as stated in the last part of section -A, second paragraph, of the Chilean Labour Code, for which reason CODELCO does not have any legal employment relationship with workers in the respective contracting and subcontracting enterprises, but only a civil relationship arising from a  contractual agreement' 
.This does not prevent CODELCO, as a party to and important component of the production process carried out jointly by CODELCO, its contractors and subcontractors, from promoting and monitoring the status of the manual of good practice (Framework Agreement) mentioned above, bearing in mind the civil relationship that exists with the contracting and subcontracting enterprises. This is precisely what happened in the signing of the so-called  Framework Agreement'  CODELCO, in the hope of contributing to the resolution of the dispute affecting its contracting enterprises and their workers, signed the document, which clearly sets out guidelines of a general nature for these enterprises. CODELCO, despite having an interest in the issue, is subject to obvious limitations as regards interfering in the definitions used in the human resources policies of contracting enterprises.
.With respect to the situation described in the complaint regarding the alleged resurgence of blacklisting at CODELCO, which prevents access to workplaces by some union leaders and also prohibits work from being given to others, the Government shares the view of the Committee on Freedom of Association that  all practices involving the blacklisting of trade union officials constitute a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights, and, in general, governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices'  That notwithstanding, there is no evidence to prove that such practices have been introduced by CODELCO. Furthermore, the accusations in question do not correspond with reality, as CODELCO is noted nationally for having almost universal unionization rates among its workers and supervisors.
.With regard to the alleged refusal by CODELCO to grant persons access to workplaces, it should be stated that, according to a report on the issue by the enterprise,  workers with a contract in force with subcontracting enterprises who are working in industrial areas in the enterprise s various divisions can enter without restriction in order to fulfil their agreed duties, under the responsibility and oversight of their respective employers'  However, although no employment relationship exists, CODELCO,  in order to safeguard the health and integrity of persons and the security of its facilities, authorizes access to workplaces provided that the corresponding permits are requested from the administration at the appropriate time and with proper grounds' 
.As will be appreciated, the complainant workers, as workers for subcontracting enterprises, would not have free access to the corporation s facilities but conditional access to the workplace entrusted to their employer. These measures to restrict access are implemented for the safety and physical integrity of people in mining installations, and in order to comply with regulations on mining safety (Supreme Decree No.  of ) and Supreme Decree No.  of , which approved basic sanitary and environmental conditions for workplaces that apply to the whole of the country s mining industry and whose aim, naturally, is to prevent risks in mining installations.
.With regard to requests for removal of union leaders, the procedure has been defined as such by the contracting enterprises for which the individuals concerned work. This procedure is, in essence, a mechanism to protect the worker against possible acts of discrimination by the employer and, as such, is a means of guaranteeing protection of the right to organize. This guarantee arises from section  of the Labour Code, which states that  in the case of workers subject to immunity from dismissal, the employer may not terminate a contract without prior authorization from a competent judge, who may allow it in the case of the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  of section  and those in section ' 
.It is for this reason, and with a view to safeguarding the employment stability of this group of workers, for example by preventing the use of anti-union practices through the discriminatory dismissal of workers, that a prior decision must be made by the courts of law, whose independence and impartiality are beyond doubt. Taking such action does not constitute an anti-union act; quite the contrary, it demonstrates a decision to proceed in obtaining prior validating authorization from a competent judge before dismissing a union leader, and the decision will therefore be taken after  due process' in which the parties, on an equal footing, can present their arguments, with the final decision resting in the hands of the judicial authorities. Of course, the legitimate party to initiate removal proceedings is the employer, in this case the contracting enterprises.
.Consequently, CODELCO cannot be considered to have engaged in anti-union practices in this sense given that, on the one hand, the removal process had been validated with regard to its legal efficiency and effectiveness by the ILO and, on the other hand, this process must be directed by the direct employer in respect of its own workers with immunity, which means that CODELCO, as the main enterprise, is also not responsible for removal actions against workers belonging to the CTC.
.With regard to CODELCO s invocation of the resources of protection and amparo (protection of constitutional rights) against the CTC, it should be clarified that the intervention of the judicial authorities in this specific case was considered indispensable by the enterprise in order to ensure guarantees of fair legal proceedings, bearing in mind that the proceedings, in accordance with the principle of interdependence of powers, are required to guarantee respect for, and compliance with, domestic law and international treaties incorporated into legislation, which includes Conventions Nos  and . This simply reflects the provisions of the Chilean Fundamental Charter, article  of which establishes that  the authority to hear civil, criminal and labour cases and to enforce judgements in such cases is vested exclusively in the courts established by law. Neither the President of the Republic nor Congress may exercise judicial functions, express an opinion on matters that are still pending, review the grounds or content of court rulings or reopen lawsuits that have been settled' 
.Regarding the facts and the case for amparo and protection brought against the CTC, CODELCO states that  as the main enterprise, it was obliged to ensure the safety and physical and psychological integrity of all those working in its installations, whatever their principal employer, and, in consequence of this duty of care, it was obliged to take the appropriate actions as allowed by law and use various means of protection in order to put an end to the illegal and violent strike pursued by the CTC'  The demonstrations in question, which prompted recourse to the courts and whose nature and effects have already been described in the observations previously made by the Government, caused a disturbance and threatened the legitimate exercise of the rights of workers at CODELCO and other enterprises not involved in the dispute. Of course, the operations put at risk by the actions of the CTC are highly complex and require safeguards for security procedures.
.With regard to the rulings handed down by the higher courts of justice in relation to the simulation of a subcontracting arrangement and the alleged introduction of an entire procedure designed to avoid applying the Subcontracting Act, it should be stated that these rulings were given in the context of the protection proceedings brought by CODELCO against the Labour Directorate which, using its supervisory powers, officially warned the enterprise to directly contract a significant number of workers from contracting enterprises. Section . of the Subcontracting Act, No. , states, with the aim of avoiding possible acts of simulation by employing enterprises, that  if the services provided are undertaken without being subjected to the requirements set out in the previous paragraph or are solely limited to the subcontracting of workers at a workplace, the employer shall be understood to be the entity in charge of the workers, enterprise or workplace, without prejudice to the appropriate sanctions arising from application of section '  This provision, aimed at protecting workers, allocates the burden of proof in the worker s favour, establishing a legal premise that the employer against which a complaint has been made must provide evidence to the contrary.
.In this regard, the Labour Directorate ruled that CODELCO should directly contract a specific number of workers from contracting enterprises. CODELCO, questioning the alleged facts as determined by the supervisory body, decided to begin legal proceedings to restrict the actions of the Labour Director. The case brought by CODELCO eventually came before Chile s Supreme Court, as part of proceedings in which the CTC participated.
.With regard to the court s jurisprudence, it should be clarified that Chilean legislation does not accord binding force to rulings given in other cases, so the situation referred to by the complainant in its written complaint,",-1,2007,Chile
101,"whereby criteria have varied and prior jurisprudence has not been followed, does not constitute any kind of irregularity. It is not true, however, that the Supreme Court has varied its judicial view with regard to the supervisory powers of the labour inspectorate, given that, since , the Supreme Tribunal has stated in some of its rulings that  the power of oversight and the task of determining the sense and scope of legislation only permit ... the observation and rectification of objective and evident violations of labour and provision legislation and must be restricted to making the relevant complaint, because the legal classification of facts is a matter of definite jurisdiction that falls within the sphere of the courts of law'  Labour inspectors are competent to take decisions only where there exists an immediate correspondence between legal provisions and the facts.
.In conclusion, Chilean labour legislation, with a view to protecting trade union rights and, in conjunction, penalizing any practice that goes against the principles of freedom of association, sets out in section  of the Labour Code a specific chapter in this respect, entitled  On unfair and anti-union practices and penalties for such practices'  This stipulates, in section ., that  examining and resolving violations involving unfair or anti-union practices shall be the responsibility of labour law judges'  This is confirmed by the administrative jurisprudence of the National Labour Directorate, which states that  examining and resolving violations involving unfair or anti-union practices shall be the responsibility of labour courts'  In connection with the information presented in this complaint, it should be mentioned that it is the courts of law that are charged with examining such matters and which, in view of their independence and impartiality, can guarantee protection for and restoration of labour rights when those rights have been violated or contravened. In this case, it does not appear that any complaint was registered with the courts of law in this respect.
.The Government states that, considering the necessity of ensuring that controversies such as those which have given rise to a dispute in this case should be subject to institutional proceedings that are most efficient and appropriate to the belligerence or impatience of the parties, it does not discount the possibility of improving its legislation on the issue of determining the status of the employer in cases where there are disagreements between the parties. From an employment perspective, it is necessary to ensure proper compliance with legislation and, in the context of the Subcontracting Act, which recognizes certain forms of outsourcing work and services, particularly through regulating work by subcontracting and recognizing situations in which personnel are supplied, a series of institutional weaknesses have become clear in terms of resolving problems that may arise in the application of new regulations, and in general with respect to legislation that penalizes employers who hide their status as such in relation to one or more employers.
.The Government states, lastly, that determining the status of an employer is the starting point for the labour protection regime maintained by labour legislation, such that determining that status cannot be left to the workers affected but requires coordinated institutional action. As a result, consideration is being given to the need to draft legislation granting the Labour Directorate the authority to bring cases before the courts if it finds that an employer s status has been concealed, given that, if responsibility for bringing a case resides solely with the worker, in practice a large part of labour legislation and, in particular, one of the aspects of the Subcontracting Act will lose their effectiveness.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainants allege that, in the context of the legal strike carried out by the CTC, which comprises workers in a subordinate and dependent relationship with contracting enterprises of the state enterprise CODELCO, between  June and  August , the forces of law and order used force in an unnecessary manner, repressed workers, carried out illegal arrests and searched the house of a member in order to temporarily detain two workers (who in the end were not charged) and that, during collective bargaining, anti-union acts occurred and workers participating in the strike were dismissed. The Committee also notes the complainants' allegations that although CODELCO, the contracting enterprises and the CTC concluded the Framework Agreement on  August  that put an end to the dispute and, among other things, provided for payment of wages not received during the days of the strike and the reinstatement of those dismissed, the Agreement, according to the complainants, has not been fully implemented and, furthermore, according to the complainants' allegations: () the removal was requested of union leaders Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo; and () blacklisting has been introduced preventing trade union leaders Mr Andrs Leal Alvarado, Mr Alvaro Guajardo, Mr Cristian Cuevas Zambrano and Mr Jorge Pea Maturana from gaining access to their workplaces. The Committee further notes that the trade union organizations object to the fact that the Labour Directorate has not promoted resolution of the dispute through the mediation system.
.With regard to the complainants' allegations that, during the strike called by the CTC in , the forces of order used force in an unnecessary manner, repressed workers, carried out illegal arrests and searched the home of a member, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () when the Secretariat-General of the national police was consulted, it stated, in a report dated  May , that, according to information obtained by the National Directorate for Security and Public Order of the National Police, no police procedures were identified which would have involved officers of the national police entering and searching trade union premises; () for their part, on  July , with prior verbal authorization from the supervisory judge for Los Andes, institutional personnel entered and searched the property belonging to Mr Cristian Patricio Cabezas Carrasco, with the intention of arresting suspects Mr Juan Carlos Miranda Zamora and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera (who, according to the complainants were not charged), both accused by witnesses of committing the offence of attacking a moving vehicle, resulting in damage, as provided for in section (h) of Traffic Act No. , in respect of bus PP-YU-, which was transporting workers who were on the way to pursue their usual duties at the mining site, the facts of which were communicated to the local Office of the Public Prosecutor for Los Andes in report No.  of  July ; () during collective bargaining and work stoppages, it is public knowledge that, in certain areas of the country, serious disruption of public order and damage to public and private property have been seen. These unlawful acts have prompted intervention by officers of the national police, with the aim of restoring the rule of law, leading to the arrests of some workers and union leaders; () individual reports of these events were produced describing actions that obstructed the normal ingress of workers and vehicles, stone throwing that resulted in injuries, cuts in the electricity supply, attacks on items belonging to fire-fighters that resulted in damage, threats against contracting workers who wanted to go about their normal duties and countless other actions which, given their severity and magnitude, warranted the intervention of officers of the national police; () fundamental labour rights, respect for and exercise of which are guaranteed by the Chilean Constitution, as well as by international treaties ratified by Chile and incorporated into domestic legislation, must exist in harmony with other fundamental rights, which justifies the intervention by the national police; and () this intervention was not in any way intended to repress or affect the essence of the fundamental rights of the organization but, on the contrary, to guarantee fuller exercise of the rights of workers in all spheres, with full respect for the other guarantees enshrined in the Fundamental Charter.
.The Committee takes note of the contradictory versions given by the complainants and the Government of the violent events that occurred during the strike. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on any proceedings against the two workers arrested during the search, sanctioned by judicial order, of the home of a member of the union, Mr Juan Carlos Miranda Zamora and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera (who, according to the complainants, were not charged) and whether other union leaders or members have been arrested and charged, and, if so, that it provide information on the charges brought and the current status of any legal proceedings. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on whether any legal action has been brought in respect of these events.
.With regard to the alleged failure to comply with the Framework Agreement concluded on  August  between CODELCO (according to the complainants, the enterprise occupies",-1,2007,Chile
102,"a dominant position with respect to the contracting and subcontracting enterprises), the subcontracting enterprises and the CTC, putting an end to the dispute, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that CODELCO has reported that the contractors have complied with the manual of good practice in a full and satisfactory manner. Furthermore, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () it does not follow that CODELCO should be accused of anti-union practices, as the employer, because it is not the employer of the complainant workers and it has the status of  main enterprise'  for which reason it does not have a legal employment relationship with workers in the respective contracting and subcontracting enterprises, but only a civil relationship arising from a  contractual agreement'  () CODELCO, as a party to and important component of the production process carried out jointly by CODELCO, its contractors and subcontractors, promotes and monitors the status of the manual of good practice and, in the hope of contributing to the resolution of the dispute affecting its contracting enterprises and their workers, signed the Agreement, which clearly sets out guidelines of a general nature for these enterprises; and () despite having an interest in the issue, CODELCO is subject to obvious limitations as regards interfering in the definitions used in the human resources policies of contracting enterprises. The Committee recalls in this respect that it has on numerous occasions underlined that  agreements should be binding on the parties' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, fifth edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, observing that the Government recognizes that CODELCO is a signatory party, together with the subcontracting enterprises, to the Framework Agreement concluded on  August  with the CTC, the Committee requests the Government to ensure compliance with the agreement in question. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the alleged request for removal of union leaders Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the procedure has been defined as such by the contracting enterprises for which the individuals concerned work; () this procedure is a mechanism to protect the worker against possible acts of discrimination by the employer and, as such, is a means of guaranteeing protection of the right to organize; () this guarantee arises from section  of the Labour Code, which states that in the case of workers subject to immunity from dismissal, the employer may not terminate a contract without prior authorization from a competent judge; () with a view to safeguarding employment stability, a prior decision must be made by the courts of law, whose independence and impartiality are beyond doubt; () taking such action does not constitute an anti-union act; quite the contrary, it is a decision to proceed in obtaining prior authorization from a competent judge before dismissing a union leader, and the decision will be taken after  due process'  () the legitimate party to initiate removal proceedings is the employer (in this case the contracting enterprises); and () CODELCO cannot be considered to have engaged in anti-union practices itself, nor is it responsible for removal actions against workers belonging to the CTC. In these circumstances, and observing that the removal requests for the union leaders were made simultaneously, including for the national director of the CTC, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the specific facts of the cases and the reasons given for beginning proceedings to remove the union leaders mentioned, and on the outcome of these proceedings.
.With regard to the allegation that blacklisting is being used to prevent access to workplaces and contact with workers by union leaders Mr Andrs Leal Alvarado, Mr Alvaro Guajardo, Mr Cristian Cuevas Zambrano and Mr Jorge Pea Maturana, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the enterprise has reported that: () workers with a contract in force with subcontracting enterprises who are working in industrial areas in the enterprise s various divisions can enter without restriction in order to fulfil their agreed duties, under the responsibility and oversight of their respective employers; and () if no employment relationship exists, in order to safeguard the health and integrity of persons and the security of facilities, access to workplaces is authorized provided that the corresponding permits are requested from the administration at the appropriate time and with proper grounds. The Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: (i) these measures to restrict access are implemented for the safety and physical integrity of people in mining installations and in order to comply with regulations on mining safety, the aim of which is to prevent risks in mining installations; and (ii) there is no evidence to prove that such practices have been introduced by CODELCO. Although it takes note of the particular characteristics of the mining industry, which could complicate the granting of access to workers from outside an enterprise, the Committee recalls that on numerous occasions it has underlined that  governments should guarantee the access of trade union representatives to workplaces, with due respect for the rights of property and management, so that trade unions can communicate with workers in order to apprise them of the potential advantages of unionization' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to promote an agreement between CODELCO and the CTC so that the CTC s representatives can gain access to workplaces to pursue their union activities, without compromising the functioning of the enterprise. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to investigate the allegation that the union leaders mentioned above have been refused work and to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the allegation that the Labour Directorate did not promote resolution of the dispute through the mediation system, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the Directorate has formal mediation facilities, staffed by professionals dedicated exclusively to the service, but that the service is initiated at the request of parties and that in this case no requests to this effect were received. In these circumstances, observing that the parties in the dispute have arrived at an agreement with regard to the dispute, the Committee will not proceed with examination of this allegation.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the complainants have stated that the enterprise introduced a procedure designed to avoid application of the Subcontracting Act and that the Government has not sent a reply in this regard. Nevertheless, the Committee will not proceed with examination of this allegation as it is not connected with alleged violations of trade union rights.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on any proceedings against the two workers arrested during the search, sanctioned by judicial order, of the home of a member of the union, Mr Juan Carlos Miranda Zamora and Mr Francisco Javier Daz Herrera (who, according to the complainants, were not charged) and whether other union leaders or members have been arrested and charged in relation to the strike carried out by the CTC between  June and  August , and, if so, that it provide information on the charges brought and the current status of any legal proceedings. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on whether any legal action has been brought in respect of these violent events.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure compliance with the agreement concluded on  August  between CODELCO, the subcontracting enterprises and the CTC. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the specific facts of the cases and the reasons given for beginning proceedings to remove the union leaders Mr Emilio Zrate Otrola, Mr Patricio Rocco Bucarey, Mr Luis Garrido Garrido, Mr Patricio Alejandro Garca Barahona, Mr Ramn Segundo Salazar Vergara, Ms Viviana Andrea Abud Flores and Mr Juan Francisco Gonzlez Bugueo, and on the outcome of these proceedings.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to promote an agreement between CODELCO and the CTC so that the CTC s representatives can gain access to workplaces to pursue their union activities, without compromising the functioning of the enterprise. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to investigate the allegation that the union leaders mentioned in the complaint have been refused work and to keep it informed in this regard.",-1,2007,Chile
103,".The complaint is contained in a joint communication dated  May  from the Trade Union Confederation of West Santiago (CONFESIMA) and the Federation of Engineering Trade Unions (FESIN), both of which sent further information in a communication dated  June . The Government sent its observations by a communication dated  September .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications dated  May and  June , CONFESIMA and FESIN allege that in March  the permanent and subcontracted forestry workers of the Bosques Arauco enterprise, which belongs to a Chilean economic grouping, initiated collective bargaining in order to obtain better wages and improved conditions of work. In view of the show of unity by the workers, the enterprise agreed to set up a negotiating body.
.The complainant organizations state that on  April , which was the deadline for reaching an agreement, more than , workers of the abovementioned enterprise began an indefinite strike since no agreement had been reached on two of the  points raised by the workers. The points of disagreement related to pay, with the workers asking for  per cent as opposed to the . per cent offered by the enterprise. The complainant organizations point out that in  the enterprise recorded sales in excess of US$, million, with profits of US$ million, equivalent to nearly US$ million profit per day, a  per cent increase over . In the first quarter of , it achieved profits of US$ million, a  per cent increase over .
.The complainant organizations point out that on  May  more than , workers demonstrated in front of the Horcones plant belonging to Bosques Arauco in Arauco province. After demonstrations lasting five hours, the workers decided to block the road in front of the plant which links Arauco with the regional capital Concepcin. This action lasted no longer than  minutes, as a result of the subsequent repression by the Chilean military police, a permanent presence there by order of the Ministry of the Interior, who subdued the workers with water cannon and tear gas and also used other armoured vehicles and troops armed with anti-riot and combat equipment. The workers were pursued and obliged to flee to a nearby forest.
.Around  p.m. ' the complainants continue ' the power supply was cut in the sector and, as part of the unrestrained repression of the workers, the military police proceeded to destroy a number of private vehicles in the vicinity which belonged to the workers. As a result, Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez, aged  years and the father of a -year-old daughter, attempted to clear the police vehicles out of the way with a backhoe excavator used in forestry work. He actually pushed a vehicle equipped with tear gas launchers off the road. A group of police then opened fire on the excavator with submachine guns and pistols. The shots were fired from the side. Three shots killed Rodrigo Cisternas, one hitting him in the head, one in the knee and one in the chest. The worker died on the spot, practically executed before attempting to get out of the excavator.
.The organizations denounce the violations of trade union rights and consider that the Government committed a criminal act by involving armed state police in the strike, undermining the workers' freedom of action and jeopardizing the exercise of freedom of association.
.Attached to the additional information sent by the complainant organizations are press cuttings and a draft agreement signed by  members of Parliament calling for the resignation of police, political and administrative officials in relation to the alleged occurrences (the draft was rejected by Congress).
.In its communication dated  September , the Government issued a general statement that national legislation recognizes workers' right to organize, in a series of legal standards and constitutional rules. Moreover, national legislation regards collective bargaining machinery as a regulated procedure designed to obtain better conditions of work and pay. Without going into detail, the Government continues, the national law contains the criteria laid down in Conventions Nos  and  of the International Labour Organization.
.The rights laid down in ILO Conventions Nos  and  recognized in national law enjoy effective protection through a system of inspection by the Labour Inspectorate, the National Labour Directorate and the judicial authorities. Protective regulatory standards enable the system to be implemented and enforced by means of administrative and judicial procedures.
.As regards the negotiating process referred to by the complainant organizations, the Government states that the incident which gave rise to the complaint occurred against the background of a complex process of negotiation, in which the Regional Labour Directorate of the eighth region of Bio Bio had an important mediating role, as described below. The process began on  February, the date on which the Forestry Union of Arauco (USINFA) (an umbrella organization of members of the Federation of Forestry Workers of Arauco (FETRAFOR), the Confederation of Forestry Workers of Chile (CTF) and the Forest Transport Coordination Office) presented the Bosques Arauco enterprise with a petition from the forestry workers of Arauco.
.The document was presented to the enterprise by means of a note to the enterprise manager. On  March , the enterprise replied to the workers' petition without agreeing to any of the demands they made and indicated its willingness to set up a working group. Considering this reply to be evasive, the workers notified the enterprise that on  March they would hold a workers' meeting at which decisions would be taken on the issues raised.
.The enterprise replied on  March, reiterating its willingness to set up a working group to examine the forestry workers' requests but without replying to the labour-related issues.
.At the meeting, the workers decided to mobilize the workers. This started on  March with a blockade of the Horcones plant of Bosques Arauco in Curanilahue, an action which involved a large group of workers. The Regional Labour Directorate consequently intervened as mediator with the aim of securing an agreement between the enterprise and the workers to enable the blockade of the plant to be lifted.
.The agreement enabled working groups to be set up involving Bosques Arauco and the workers represented by USINFA. Immediately, on  March, the labour authority put forward a proposal establishing an executive body comprising representatives of USINFA, Bosques Arauco and the Labour Directorate, under which four working groups would discuss specific aspects of the set of demands (harvesting, transport, working hours, working environment and safety). As regards the employees of other enterprises in the group (Aserraderos Arauco, Paneles Arauco and Celulosa Arauco), since Bosques Arauco was not in a position to negotiate on their behalf, the Labour Directorate took the necessary steps to obtain a reply from the authorized spokespersons for the industrial workers in order to set up a negotiating body to deal with their demands.
.The work of the groups went ahead as planned from  March to  April, with agreements being reached on all issues except pay. On  April, Bosques Arauco presented its pay proposal to the executive body. This comprised a guaranteed bonus equivalent to . monthly minimum wages (, Chilean pesos) payable in  monthly instalments, plus minimum bonuses for Christmas and national holidays of , pesos on each occasion, with a guaranteed increase of , pesos for workers who were already receiving benefits.
.USINFA declared that it totally rejected the enterprise s proposal, announcing that it would resume mobilization of the workers with the aim of achieving better results, especially for drivers, whose wage increase was . per cent, far less than the requested  per cent. Accordingly, the workers decided to mobilize on  April, with some , workers blocking the entrance to the Horcones plant.
.Given the enterprise s refusal to negotiate with the workers, the Regional Labour Directorate asked the Archbishop of the city of Concepcin to mediate. Even though the parties agreed to this, Bosques Arauco decided not to continue with negotiations, saying that it was for the service enterprises whose workers were on strike to continue the dialogue.
.A new offer was presented on  May, this time by the service enterprises, which consisted of a wage increase ranging from a minimum of , to a maximum of , pesos. The offer was rejected by the workers who were blocking access to the Horcones plant. At  p.m. the same day, these workers decided to blockade route No. , an action which resulted in the confrontation with the Chilean police force and culminated in the deplorable death of the worker Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez.
.After this regrettable event, the workers held a press conference to deplore the worker s death, dialogue was resumed and an agreement was finally reached with the service enterprises on  May. The agreement consisted of an increase of , Chilean pesos for all workers, plus bonuses of at least , pesos for",0,2007,Chile
104,"national holidays and Christmas, and the undertaking to initiate negotiations with the industrial workers in order to consider extension of the benefits to that area.
.Regarding the death of Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez, the Government reiterates that on  May  some , workers were blockading the entrance to the Horcones plant of Bosques Arauco. After rejecting the offer proposed by the service enterprises, the mobilized workers decided to block the road linking Curanilahue with Concepcin, the capital of the eighth region.
.According to the information supplied by the authority responsible for public order, the Chilean police force, in response to the blockade, proceeded to clear the road, which led to clashes between the police and the demonstrators. During the demonstrations, in circumstances that were unclear, Mr Rodrigo Cisternas rammed two police vehicles with a front loader, injuring the police officers inside. The aforementioned worker died when police officers attempted to stop his attack on the police, reporters and cameramen who were present at the scene.
.The Government points out that these regrettable occurrences are the subject of a judicial investigation by an inspecting judge with special jurisdiction requested by the Chilean Ministry of the Interior, in view of the public outcry caused by an occurrence of this nature in addition to the gravity and harmful consequences of this occurrence, which call for prompt punishment. For the above reasons, the matter is being fully investigated.
.The Government regrets the death of Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez and, as well as emphasizing that the events are being investigated by the judicial authorities, it stresses its willingness to keep the Committee informed in this respect with regard to progress made on pending court decisions, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in law.
.Finally, the Government emphasizes that the labour authority was always present in the negotiating process, seeking a beneficial solution for both parties.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that, in the context of a strike at the Bosques Arauco enterprise with demonstrations and the blockade of a road by the workers, the military police intervened using water cannon and tear gas, in addition to destroying private vehicles belonging to workers, and the worker Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez attempted to clear the police vehicles out of the way with a backhoe excavator (as used in forestry work), actually pushing a vehicle equipped with tear gas launchers off the road. According to the complainants, a squad of police officers then opened fire with submachine guns and pistols on the excavator driven by Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez, who received several bullet wounds (including one to the head) and died.
.The Committee notes the Government s statements concerning the negotiation process between the parties to the collective dispute and concerning the presence and mediation of the administrative labour authority, as well as the fact that following the death of Mr Cisternas Fernndez the parties reached an agreement. As regards the death of the striking worker Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez, the Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that: () the judicial authority is investigating the facts and the ILO will be kept informed of all progress made; () on  May , some , workers blocked the entrance to the Horcones plant of the Bosques Arauca enterprise and, after rejecting a new offer from the service enterprises whose workers were on strike, decided to blockade the road; () according to the information from the authority responsible for public order, the Chilean police force, in response to the blockade, proceeded to clear the road, which led to clashes between the police and the demonstrators. During the demonstrations, the Government goes on to say, in circumstances that were unclear, Mr Rodrigo Cisternas rammed two police vehicles with a front loader, injuring the police officers inside. The aforementioned worker died when police officers attempted to stop his attack on the police, reporters and cameramen present at the scene.
.The Committee deplores the death of the striking worker Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez as a result of being shot by the police and also the injuries to a number of police officers. The Committee observes that the respective versions of the alleged events from the complainant organizations and the Government do not tally completely and therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigation, while expecting that the respective responsibilities will be clearly defined and, if appropriate, that the penalties provided for by law will be imposed. In more general terms, the Committee underlines the importance of collective disputes being conducted and resolved peacefully within the framework of collective bargaining and also emphasizes that  in cases of strike movements, the authorities should resort to the use of force only in grave situations where law and order is seriously threatened' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ] and  the intervention of the police should be in proportion to the threat to public order' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. On the other hand, the Committee recalls that workers' organizations should respect legal provisions on public order and abstain from acts of violence in demonstrations.
.Taking into consideration that it has been obliged, in other cases concerning Chile, to examine allegations of violence between strikers and the authorities in connection with collective disputes, the Committee requests the Government to organize tripartite activities to examine this issue, and reminds the Government that ILO technical assistance is at its disposal, if it so wishes.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial investigation into the death of the striking worker Mr Rodrigo Cisternas Fernndez, while expecting that the respective responsibilities will be clearly defined and, if appropriate, that the penalties provided for by law will be imposed.(b) Taking into consideration that it has been obliged, in other cases concerning Chile, to examine allegations of violence between strikers and the authorities in connection with collective disputes, the Committee requests the Government to organize tripartite activities to examine this issue and reminds the Government that ILO technical assistance is at its disposal, if it so wishes.",1,2007,Chile

.The Committee notes that in the present complaint, the complainant organization alleges that SENAME removed trade union official Bernardo Hernndez de la Fuente (president of the complainant union in the city of Talca) from his post on the grounds of his alleged attempt to log into a computer used to store confidential information, and in order to do so used an administrative procedure which contravened the rules of due process and resulted in the imposition of a penalty which, even if the alleged offence had been proved ' and the complainant denies this, his accuser having merely claimed to have seen him in the vicinity of a computer containing confidential information ' would not justify dismissal, but rather an adverse comment or reduction in salary.
.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements to the effect that: () legislation grants trade union officials protection from dismissal except in cases of the disciplinary sanction of removal from office imposed by the administrative authority after the appropriate administrative proceedings and confirmed by the Comptroller General of the Republic, a body independent of other state authorities, following an examination of the legal, formal and substantive aspects of the case and of any statements presented by the party concerned; () the administrative proceedings confirmed that the accused had been responsible for serious violation of the principle of administrative fairness by virtue of having sought access to information held on a computer without the authorization of the official responsible for administrative proceedings in another case, in order to review witness statements and those of one of the parties; () the Santiago Appeals Court considered that  the request for protection lodged by the appellant claims that the disciplinary measure of dismissal was illegal and arbitrary, despite the fact that it followed administrative proceedings that respected legal standards and allowed the individual in question the benefit of due process of law, and the competent authority s ruling cannot therefore be deemed to be illegal or arbitrary; the constitutional guarantee invoked by the appellant was therefore not violated'  () the official in question has applied to the th Civil Court of Santiago for a ruling that the administrative proceedings against him are null and void, thus overturning the dismissal order and ordering his reinstatement; the case is still pending and no judicial ruling has been handed down.
.The Committee regrets that neither the complainant organization nor the Government have communicated the administrative decision to dismiss the official, along with its operative part.
.Whatever the case may be, the Committee, noting that the union official in question has lodged a new appeal with the th Civil Court of Santiago, seeking a ruling overturning the administrative proceedings against him and ordering his reinstatement, requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to communicate any ruling handed down.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Noting that the union official Bernardo Hernndez de la Fuente has lodged a new appeal with the th Civil Court of Santiago, seeking a ruling overturning the administrative proceedings against him and ordering his reinstatement, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments and communicate to it any ruling handed down.",-1,2007,Chile

.The Government sent partial observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee urges the Government to send its observations without delay on the alleged repeated interventions of the police in the demonstration and march held by the strikers on  November .(b) The Committee urges the Government to send, without delay, its observations on the alleged anti-trade union dismissals at the enterprise Interparking Ltda. and the alleged establishment of an employer-controlled trade union organization financed by the company, to carry out an inquiry into these matters, if this has not yet been done, and to send detailed information as to the outcome.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states in regard to recommendation (a) made by the Committee at its June  meeting, that in report No. , the Undersecretariat of the Chilean Police (Carabineros de Chile), states that the subordinate officer in charge at the scene spoke with the group s spokesperson, who was leading the demonstration. The latter produced a document from the metropolitan administration of Santiago  Approval No.  dated  November '  which authorized the demonstration, and also a written undertaking stating that the participants undertook to take all necessary measures to ensure the normal and peaceful conduct of the demonstration and to avoid any acts damaging public or private property or seriously disturbing the peace, as well as to assume responsibility for any damage caused and to provide any assistance that might be required by courts of law. The police withdrew from the scene as soon as they had checked the above documents and verified that the situation was calm.
.The police Communications Centre subsequently informed the same official that individuals participating in the demonstration had entered the central office of the Interparking Ltda. enterprise and had locked themselves inside office No.  at , avenida Manquehue. These workers were removed by the police by order of the Public Prosecutor on duty (penal proceedings were instituted against some of the workers who had occupied the office, but were subsequently shelved; these allegations have already been examined by the Committee).
.With regard to subparagraph (b) of the Committee s recommendations, the enterprise Interparking Ltda. indicates that it decided to terminate the employment contracts of Mr Claudio Elgueta Valenzuela and Mr Juan Manuel Valenzuela Navarro  because they had seriously and consistently breached and failed to carry out their employment obligations'  they  had previously been issued repeated written warnings to improve their conduct, but had disregarded them'  The company points out that  when these workers were dismissed, a labour inspector came to the company and ordered their reinstatement on the grounds that they were protected by alleged trade union immunity. When the company informed the inspector that it was not aware of this, he produced a communication, signed by Mr Juan Ortiz Arcos, in which the National Inter-Enterprise Union of Metallurgy, Communications, Energy and Allied Workers (SME), states that  Mr Juan Valenzuela Navarro has been elected as a representative of our trade union in the Interparking Ltda. enterprise'  According to the company, this communication is not binding. It considers that this inter-enterprise trade union does not have the statutory power to appoint a trade union representative in their company or any other company as it sees fit. This power is conferred by law on the workers of a company who are members of an inter-enterprise trade union, provided that none of them has been elected as an officer of that union. However, this does not mean that this inter-enterprise trade union can impose a representative on the company if that representative has not been democratically elected; the representative can only be elected by workers of the company where he or she works as an employee (section  of the Labour Code). In line with the above, the company states that when the workers were asked whether they had held an election, they said that they had not. The company states that, despite this situation, the workers were reinstated. The reinstatement of Mr Claudio Elgueta Valenzuela was ordered by the Labour Directorate, but the Seventh Labour Court of Santiago ordered the dismissal of this worker covered by trade union immunity in a ruling handed down on  June . His dismissal was ordered on the grounds of serious misconduct on the part of this worker, who was convicted of fraud by the Fourth Santiago Guarantees Court.
.Following a consultation of the Regional Labour Directorate in a communication of April , the Directorate reported acts of harassment against trade union representatives Mr Claudio Elgueta Valenzuela and Mr Juan Manuel Valenzuela Navarro; it also stated that workers had been pressured into agreeing to a modification of their individual contracts in regard to their working hours, which were divided into shifts. An agreement on overtime was reached, a draft collective agreement mentioning the subject having been presented on the day before these incidents took place by workers who were members of the trade union. As regards these accusations, the responsible labour inspectorate noted the acts at issue in inspection report No. ..., dated  November , and a complaint of anti-union practices was accordingly filed with the court under Case No. . On  September , the Court upheld the complaint and imposed a fine of  monthly tax units on the company. Notwithstanding the above, there is no mention of records of anti-union dismissals in the Regional Directorate report.
.The company states that the allegations concerning the establishment of an employer-controlled trade union organization financed by the company are completely untrue, without providing any further information on the matter. There are no judicial or other records substantiating this claim.
.The Committee recalls that when it examined this case in June  it requested the Government: (a) to send its observations without delay on the alleged repeated interventions of the police in the demonstration and march held by the strikers on  November ; and (b) to send, without delay, its observations on the alleged anti-trade union dismissals at the enterprise Interparking Ltda. and the alleged establishment of an employer-controlled trade union organization financed by the company, to carry out an inquiry into these matters, if this has not yet been done, and to send detailed information as to the outcome.
.With regard to the alleged repeated interventions of the police in the demonstration and march held by the strikers on  November , the Committee notes that the Government declares that the Undersecretariat of the Chilean police (Carabineros de Chile) reported that: () the subordinate officer in charge at the scene spoke with the group s spokesperson, who was leading the demonstration. The latter produced a document from the metropolitan administration of Santiago authorizing the demonstration, and also a written undertaking stating that the participants undertook to take all necessary measures to ensure the normal and peaceful conduct of the demonstration and to avoid any acts damaging public or private property or seriously disturbing the peace, as well as to assume responsibility for any damage caused and to provide any assistance that might be required by courts of law; and () the police withdrew from the scene as soon as they had checked the above documents and verified that the situation was calm.

.With regard to the dismissal of Mr Claudio Elgueta Valenzuela after he was convicted of fraud, the Committee recalls that Convention No.  does not protect against abuses involving criminal activity while exercising trade union rights. However, the Committee notes with interest the reinstatement of trade union representative Mr Juan Manuel Valenzuela Navarro and requests that the Government ensure that he was paid his wages due and benefits not received during the period following his dismissal.
.With regard to the alleged establishment of an employer-controlled trade union financed by the company, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that the company reports that these allegations are completely untrue, and that there are no judicial or other records substantiating this claim.

108,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  session and on that occasion made the following recommendations [see th Report, paras ' ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any judicial proceedings with respect to: () the legal basis of the payments corresponding to the so-called compensatory meals and transport allowance and the end-of-negotiation bonus; and () the dispute arising from the alleged non-payment of social security contributions relating to certain bonuses payable under the collective labour agreements between  and . Similarly, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether, as a result of the agreement concluded between the complainant union and Correos de Chile on  January , the legal proceedings in question have been discontinued. The Committee trusts that the judicial authority will pronounce itself in an expeditious manner.(b) The Committee once again requests the Government to confirm whether Correos de Chile has been included in the list of enterprises and trade union organizations found guilty of unfair or anti-union practices (as required by law).
.In a communication of  January , the Government indicates, with regard to judicial decisions issued with respect to the legal basis of the payments corresponding to the so-called compensatory meals, transport and end-of-negotiation allowance, that the trade union and the enterprise in question, in a settlement contained in a public instrument of  May , signed before the Santiago public notary Ms Mara Gloria Acharan Toledo, agreed to bring to a close the legal proceedings in which the recognition and payment of such allowances were discussed. According to section  of the Civil Code, such a settlement  is a contract whereby the parties settle a pending lawsuit out of court or forestall a lawsuit in the future'  through mutual concessions. The Civil Code provides in section  that such settlements  have the force of res judicata'  which is why the discussion of the matter could not be reopened between the same parties for the same purpose, or with the same cause of action. Under this settlement, the enterprise paid the complainant workers the amounts which it was instructed to pay in the text, which were received by the complainants in full satisfaction. No disputes are still pending, either with the trade union or with the workers who belong to that organization, and any dispute that might have arisen in this respect must be considered to have been settled. The Committee notes this information with interest.
.The Government indicates that, with regard to the dispute arising from the alleged non-payment of social security contributions corresponding to certain bonuses payable under collective labour agreements between  and , on  October  a final decision was handed down in the first instance, under Case No. - of the Second Labour Court of Santiago, rejecting the claims that formed the basis of the aforementioned dispute. The complainants filed an appeal against this decision. A decision on the appeal, which has to be made by the Santiago Court of Appeals, is pending. The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal in question.
.As to whether the enterprise Correos de Chile has been included in the list of enterprises and trade union organizations found guilty of unfair or anti-union practices, as required by law, the Government indicates that the enterprise in question was sentenced on  December , in Case No. - of the Ninth Labour Court of Santiago, to pay  monthly tax units, plus costs, for discriminating against the members of the National Trade Union of Professionals, Postal Technicians, Supervisors and other Employees of Correos de Chile, by not paying them compensatory benefits. The Committee notes this information.

.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.In its communication of  February , the Government indicates that, when it was called upon to provide information regarding the circumstances that prompted the complaint, Correos de Chile reported as follows:
.The Committee recalls that, when it last examined this case, it requested the Government: (i) to confirm whether Correos de Chile had been included in the list of enterprises and trade union organizations found guilty of unfair or anti-union practices (as required by law); (ii) to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings initiated by the complainant trade union with respect to: () non-compliance with clauses of the collective agreement according certain benefits, and specifically the non-payment of those benefits to new members of the union; () non-payment of the professional category allowance provided for in the collective agreement to workers joining the enterprise, while at the same time offering these same workers a  meals allowance' far greater than that scheduled under the collective agreement; () non-payment of social security contributions provided for in collective agreements (' ); () the allegation that the enterprise had not paid  parcels unit and routing centre workers belonging to the complainant union the productivity bonus agreed upon by the enterprise and the five trade unions that operated there; and (iii) to send its observations on the alleged dismissal of more than  members of the complainant trade union since  (including Italo Ferraro Moya in August , Patricia Macarena Cortes Monroy in March , Jaime Amor Illanes and five workers from the Financial Control Unit in March May , whom the enterprise immediately replaced by new workers who were assigned the same functions in the unit). In addition, the Committee: (a) invited the complainant union to request the mediation of the Labour Relations Unit of the Labour Directorate in order to improve its line of communication with the enterprise and to contribute to resolving the problems; and (b) requested the Government and the complainant to inform it whether any complaints had been lodged concerning the (very general) allegations that the enterprise had pressured workers to resign from the trade union and had offered to appoint low-level line managers to senior management posts (supposedly so that they would cease to be members of the union) or to positions of trust.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of more than  members of the complainant trade union since  (including Italo Ferraro Moya in August , Patricia Macarena Cortes Monroy in March , Jaime Amor Illanes and five workers from the Financial Control Unit in March May , whom the enterprise immediately replaced by new workers who were assigned the same functions in the unit), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the enterprise points out that: () the Labour Code gives employers",-1,2006,Chile
109,"the authority to terminate employment contracts in accordance with the operational requirements of the undertaking, establishment or service, provided that the dismissed persons receive compensation in lieu of notice and for years of service, as provided for in the Labour Code; () the enterprise took various restructuring and modernization measures to enhance its capacity to meet its corporate objectives and to deal with the increasing competition from other bodies that provide similar postal services, leading to the termination of the employment contracts not only of members of the complainant union but also of workers belonging to the other unions existing in the enterprise, which is why it cannot be inferred that adoption of the abovementioned decisions led to the dismissal only of workers from the complainant union, or assumed that the aim of such decisions is to discriminate against the union in question; and () the dismissed workers have received in full the salary payments, benefits and compensation owed to them by law and those workers whose legal claims led to favourable rulings were granted severance pay with the additional amount provided for in such cases by the Labour Code. In these circumstances, taking into account the information provided by the enterprise, the Committee will not continue its examination of these allegations.
.The Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings initiated by the complainant trade union with respect to: () non-compliance with clauses of the collective agreement according certain benefits, and specifically the non-payment of those benefits to new members of the union; () non-payment of the professional category allowance provided for in the collective agreement to workers joining the enterprise, while at the same time offering these same workers a  meals allowance' far greater than that scheduled under the collective agreement; () non-payment of social security contributions provided for in collective agreements (' ); () the allegation that the enterprise had not paid  parcels unit and routing centre workers belonging to the complainant union the productivity bonus agreed upon by the enterprise and the five trade unions that operated there.
.In this regard, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government, the enterprise provided the following information: () the enterprise has continued to have differences of opinion with the Trade Union of Professionals, Postal Technicians, Supervisors and other Employees of Correos de Chile, especially with regard to the interpretation and application of certain clauses in collective labour agreements; () one of the most significant differences of opinion at the current time relates to the debate on the benefits provided for under the agreement reached with the trade union on  December ; () in the collective bargaining process that followed the entry into force of this agreement, the worker members of the union decided to call on the employer to sign a new collective agreement with the same terms as those applicable at the time the draft agreement was presented; () this gave rise to a debate between the union and the enterprise which led to three sets of labour court proceedings, two of which resulted in court orders to sign new collective agreements with the same terms as the agreement of  December , without revising the dates on which the benefits contested by the enterprise were payable; () one of the abovementioned court orders revised the dates only for the end-of-negotiation bonus while the other did not revise the dates for any of the benefits included in the new collective agreement; () considering the above, the trade union took enforcement action to ensure payment of the benefits provided for under the new agreements, focusing specifically on the payment of the so-called compensatory meals and transport allowance and the end-of-negotiation bonus; () the debate is now concentrated on determining the legal basis of the two abovementioned bonus payments, a matter which has been referred to the Court for the Collection of Labour and Social Security Contributions in Santiago, which must issue a ruling on the matter. The dispute must be settled by the competent court dealing with such matters in accordance with the legislation currently in force; () the same applies to the dispute arising from the alleged non-payment of social security contributions corresponding to certain bonuses payable under collective labour agreements between  and . This matter has also been referred for consideration and decision to the competent courts, which operate within the meaning of the Constitution and the law, in accordance with the principles described above; () with regard to the professional category allowance, the enterprise emphasizes that it is paid to all workers who are entitled to such a benefit under the relevant collective labour agreements. The differences of opinion on this matter have virtually been settled, as the situation of those who might have given rise to debate on this issue has been rectified, to the full satisfaction of the union, notwithstanding that the union leaders and the representatives of the enterprise are engaged in a permanent dialogue to settle and rectify any ad hoc cases that might arise; () likewise, the issue of the meals allowance is not currently under discussion; () with regard to the allegation that  workers in the parcels unit and routing centre belonging to the complainant union had not been included in the variable remuneration system, the enterprise and the complainant union reached an agreement on  October  to extend the variable remuneration system to workers belonging to that union, with retroactive effect from the date on which the agreement with the other unions had been signed; and () as can be seen from the foregoing, the complaints filed by the complainant organization involve disputes that have been referred to the courts for a decision; the parties are fully bound by the ensuing court decisions and may not withdraw cases from the courts which under Chilean legislation are responsible for settling the matters arising from the disputes and refer them to any other body for parallel consideration, as this would be a denial of the jurisdiction and authority of the abovementioned courts and of the rules governing their operation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the judicial decisions that are issued in relation to: () the legal basis of the so-called compensatory meals and transport allowance payments and the end-of-negotiation bonus; and () the dispute arising from the alleged non-payment of social security contributions corresponding to certain bonuses payable under collective labour agreements between  and . The Committee trusts that the judicial authority will pronounce itself in an expenditious manner.
.The Committee recalls that it invited the complainant union to request the mediation of the Labour Relations Unit of the Labour Directorate in order to improve its line of communication with the enterprise and to contribute to resolving the problems. In this respect, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the enterprise indicates that: () there has been a positive change, which is characterized by intense dialogue and a commitment to accomplish in full the common endeavours of the workers and the enterprise; () this is how the last collective bargaining process, which ended in January , led to a collective agreement, which was the result of an understanding between the parties and which benefited approximately  members, under which the trade union stopped applying the principle of renewing the provisions of the previous agreement; () the new collective agreement underwent several modifications in , reflecting the shared interests of the parties with regard to how labour relations and terms of remuneration are dealt with; () it is worth noting that the leaders of the complainant trade union have actively participated at meetings, at which the leaders of the other trade unions and the directors of the enterprise have also participated, dealing with issues such as variable remuneration and at which the enterprise has informed workers about relevant aspects of its operation and future plans; () the relations between the complainant union and the enterprise are currently characterized by dialogue and understanding; () on  January , the Trade Union of Professionals, Postal Technicians, Supervisors and other Employees of Correos de Chile signed an agreement with Correos de Chile, under which the parties once and for all set aside any differences relating to the benefit under the collective labour agreement known as the professional category allowance; () the enterprise acknowledged the legal premise for paying, as of January , the amounts that in each case are scheduled as the professional category allowance, to workers who belong to the union in question and whose names are listed in the agreement. Accordingly, the enterprise paid on a one-off basis a specified amount to each of the workers mentioned in the abovementioned agreement, in compensation for any non-payment of or discrepancy in this benefit prior to  January ; and () the enterprise indicated that, in accordance with this agreement, the union and the enterprise have definitively set aside any differences of opinion relating to",2,2006,Chile
110,"this benefit and that the union members entitled to this benefit have been clearly identified, as have been the amounts that each of these members will receive.
.The Committee takes note of this information with interest, and requests the Government to inform it whether, as a result of the agreement in question, the complainant union has agreed to discontinue the legal proceedings under way relating to the payment of the allowances mentioned in the above paragraphs.
.With regard to its previous recommendation, in which it requested the Government and the complainant organization to inform it whether any complaints had been lodged concerning the (very general) allegations that the enterprise had pressured workers to resign from the trade union and had offered to appoint low-level line managers to senior management posts (supposedly so that they would cease to be members of the union) or to positions of trust, the Committee, noting that no information has been provided in this respect, will not continue its examination of these allegations.
.Lastly, the Committee once again requests the Government to confirm whether Correos de Chile has been included in the list of enterprises and trade union organizations found guilty of unfair or anti-union practices (as required by law).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any judicial proceedings with respect to: () the legal basis of the payments corresponding to the so-called compensatory meals and transport allowance and the end-of-negotiation bonus; and () the dispute arising from the alleged non-payment of social security contributions relating to certain bonuses payable under the collective labour agreements between  and .

The Committee also observes that the judicial authority is still to decide certain appeals lodged by the company and that it ruled against the recourse of the labour inspection claiming the non-compliance by the company of the trade union leave; an appeal was lodged against this ruling. The Committee strongly expresses the expectation that such anti-union acts will not recur in the future and requests the Government to ensure compliance with Conventions Nos.  and  by those companies.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the appeals lodged with regards to this case, in particular on the appeal relating to trade union leave of FENATEL officials, or relating to the non compliance with the clauses of the collective agreement, and to indicate whether FENATEL has lodged an appeal with respect to the dismissal of the delegates of that organization in respect of whom the company states that it was unaware of their position as delegates and that in any event they did not enjoy trade union status.

.The Committee recalls that the outstanding allegations in this case relate to practices employed by ING Seguros de Vida S.A. to prevent collective bargaining, dismissal of delegates and members of the complainant trade union, pressure by the enterprise to force members working at two branches to resign from their trade union, non-compliance with collective agreements, and the enterprise s refusal to recognize the affiliation to the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union of workers whose employment contracts it had modified, with the result that the union is running short of money and its existence is under threat. The Committee observes that, regarding the recommendations it made when it last examined this case at its meeting in June  [see th Report, para. ], the Government has sent information it had received from ING Seguros de Vida S.A. and from the complainant trade union.Recommendation (a)
.The Committee expresses its concern about the numerous anti-trade union practices that the administrative and legal authorities have verified at ING Seguros de Vida S.A. and AFP Santa Mara S.A. The Committee notes that ING Seguros de Vida S.A. states that the differences that existed have been resolved and that both union officials and the workers affiliated to the said unions are now governed by the same rules and regulations that apply to all employees of the various ING companies; the court cases have been dropped, the benefits have been incorporated into the individual contracts and a collective agreement, dated  March , has been signed with the members of the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union, running for a little over two years from  March  to  June ; currently, there are no grounds for the complaints submitted to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association, though ING Seguros de Vida S.A. and AFP Santa Mara S.A. maintain that, in their view, there never was any threat to freedom of association. The Committee also notes the communication from the complainant organization that was sent by the Government which states that, so long as the enterprise violates the provisions of the labour legislation and flaunts the resolutions of the Labour Directorate, it will continue to inform the competent authorities of any activity that might be to the detriment of either the freedom of association of the workers or any instrument governing their collective labour relations.Recommendation (b)
.As to the practices allegedly employed by the enterprise to prevent collective bargaining by workers affiliated both to the SNTISV and the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union in , by refusing in practice to negotiate, the Committee requested the Government to take measures to ensure that in future ING Seguros de Vida S.A. and AFP Santa Mara S.A. respect this principle and abstain from employing anti-trade union practices such as those verified by the Labour Inspectorate. The Committee notes the enterprise s statement that: () under Chilean legislation, the right to collective bargaining is written into the Constitution and is regulated by the Labour Code, and both the SNTISV and the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union have freely exercised their legal right to bargain collectively; () on  December , a collective agreement was signed with the workers affiliated to the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations; () in negotiations with ING Seguros de Vida S.A. in June , when no agreement was reached, the workers exercised their prerogative under section  of the Labour Code to extend the existing collective agreement by a further  months; () on  March , the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union negotiated a collective agreement with the general management of the company, which is currently in force; and () in the case of the SNTISV, there is neither a contract nor a collective agreement and workers affiliated to the union therefore have the same rights and benefits as the rest of the company s employees. The Committee notes with interest that a collective agreement has been concluded between the enterprise and the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union. However, the Committee requests the Government to endeavour to effectively promote and encourage the full development and use of voluntary negotiation procedures between the enterprise and the SNTISV, with a view to regulating employment conditions through collective agreements.Recommendation (c)
.With regard to the dismissal of delegates and members of the complainant trade union (SNTISV) subsequent to the  collective bargaining process, the Committee invited the complainant organization to send details of the names of those dismissed and any facts that may indicate that the dismissals were linked to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee observes that the complainant organization has not provided the information requested. On the other hand, the Committee notes that ING Seguros de Vida S.A. states that none of the companies of the ING group has initiated legal proceedings to lift the immunity of any of its trade union officials, but that some union officials have entered into an agreement to leave the enterprise of their own free will, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force.Recommendation (d)
.As to the alleged pressure on workers to withdraw from the complainant trade union (SNTISV), the Committee deplored the pressure of an anti-trade union nature verified by the judicial authority and requested the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that ING Seguros de Vida S.A. abstains from such practices, as well as from offering benefit packages to workers in return for not joining the trade union, as stated by the Government. The Committee notes that ING Seguros de Vida S.A. states that: () it has never exercised any pressure to force workers to resign from their trade union; and () what workers describe as pressure after the company changed hands was in fact a reorganization of the ING group of companies, in the process of which the sales staff received all the severance pay and compensation to which they were entitled before being laid off; a large number of them were rehired under new terms of remuneration and benefits and could rejoin their union if they wished. Given the contradictions between the enterprise s statement and the Government s reply that was examined in June , which reported that the judicial authority had fined the enterprise for the alleged occurrences [see th report, para. ], the Committee requests the Government to see, in accordance with the judicial decision, that its previous recommendations are complied with, by taking the effective measures necessary to ensure that ING Seguros de Vida S.A. does not exert pressure on its workers to resign from the complainant organization and that workers are able to maintain their union membership.Recommendation (e)
.As to the enterprise s alleged failure to comply with the collective agreements, the Committee requested the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that ING Seguros de Vida S.A. respected the legislation and the collective agreement that was extended by  months in the light of article  of the Labour Code. The Committee notes the enterprise s statement that: () it has not failed to meet any of its commitments under individual contracts or collective agreements; what occurred was a dispute between the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union and the enterprise over the source of certain payments under the collective agreement, which led to two court cases that have now been settled under a deal approved by the competent court; and () when no agreement was reached in the collective bargaining of June , the workers of ING Seguros de Vida S.A. exercised their prerogative under section  of the Labour Code to extend the existing collective agreement.Recommendation (f)
.As to the alleged refusal of AFP Santa Mara S.A. to recognize the affiliation to the AFP Santa Mara S.A. Trade Union of workers whose employment contracts were modified, or to include them in the collective bargaining process, the Committee noted that these facts were verified by the judicial authority and requested the Government to take the necessary measures to prevent the enterprise from having recourse to anti-trade union practices in the future. In this regard, the Committee notes the enterprise s statement that it has always respected the laws and regulations in force, that its workers are the very backbone of the group and that, where there has been a dispute with any of the trade unions, it has been submitted to the competent court for decision. Given that the alleged events were verified and confirmed by the administrative and judicial authorities [see th Report, para. ], the Committee requests the Government to ensure that its previous recommendations are complied with, by taking the necessary effective measures to prevent the enterprise in future from resorting to anti-trade union practices.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)",0,2004,Chile
114,"The Committee requests the Government to endeavour to effectively promote and encourage the full development and use of voluntary negotiation procedures between ING Seguros de Vida S.A. and the National Trade Union of ING Seguros de Vida S.A. (SNTISV), with a view to regulating employment conditions through collective agreements.(b) Given the contradictions between the enterprise s statement and the Government s reply, and specifically that the judicial authority fined the enterprise for the alleged occurrences, the Committee requests the Government to ensure, in conformity with the judicial decisions, that its previous recommendations are complied with, by taking the effective measures necessary to ensure that ING Seguros de Vida S.A. does not exert pressure on its workers to resign from the complainant organization and that workers are able to maintain their union membership.(c) As to the alleged refusal of AFP Santa Mara S.A. to recognize the affiliation to the AFP Santa Mara S.A.

.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses its concern in observing the numerous anti-trade union practices ongoing within the ING Seguros de Vida S.A. and AFP Santa Maria enterprises, which were verified by the administrative and judicial authorities and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that Conventions Nos.  and  are fully respected within the abovementioned enterprises.(b) As to the practices allegedly employed by the enterprise to prevent collective bargaining by workers, belonging both to the National Trade Union of Workers of ING Seguros de Vida S.A. (SNTISV) and the Trade Union ING AFP Santa Mara in , in that the enterprise refused to participate in the collective bargaining process, the Committee highlights the principle that, while the question as to whether or not one party adopts an amenable or uncompromising attitude towards the other party is a matter for negotiation between the parties, both employers and trade unions should bargain in good faith making every effort to reach an agreement. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that in the future the ING Seguros de Vida S.A. and AFP Santa Mara enterprises respect this principle and abstain from employing anti-trade union practices such as those verified by the Labour Inspectorate.(c) With regard to the dismissal of delegates and members of the SNTISV subsequent to the  collective bargaining process, the Committee invites the complainant organization to communicate any information regarding the number of individuals dismissed and any facts that may indicate that the dismissals are linked to the exercise of trade union rights.(d) As to the alleged pressure for workers to withdraw from the SNTISV, the Committee deplores the pressure of an anti-trade union nature verified by the judicial authority and requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that the enterprise ING Seguros de Vida S.A. abstains from such practices, as well as from offering benefit packages to workers in return for not joining the trade union, as stated by the Government. The Committee also deplores the fact that these practices led to the workers feeling compelled to leave the trade union.(e) As to the enterprise s alleged failure to comply with the collective agreements, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the ING Seguros de Vida S.A. respects the legislation and the collective agreement which was extended for  months in light of article  of the Labour Code.(f) As to the enterprise s alleged refusal to recognize as members of the Trade Union ING AFP Santa Mara those workers whose labour agreements were amended by the enterprise and excluded them from the scope of the collective bargaining process, the Committee notes that these facts were verified by the judicial authority and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to prevent the enterprise from having recourse to anti-trade union practices in the future.(g) The Committee requests the Government to solicit information from the employers' organizations concerned, with a view to having at its disposal their views, as well as those of the enterprises concerned, on the questions at issue.",2,2004,Chile
115,".The complaint is set out in a letter from the National Association of Ministry of Education Staff (ANDIME) of  April , supported by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), in a letter of  May . The Government sent its observations in a letter of  July .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter of  April , the National Association of Ministry of Education Staff (ANDIME) submitted a complaint supported by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  May , in which it alleges that Law No. / created the National Culture and Arts Council, an autonomous, decentralized and geographically distributed public service with legal personality and its own capital, directly responsible to the President of the Republic. Transitional article  of this law indicates that the staff of the Cultural Extension Division in the Ministry of Education will automatically become part of the establishment of the aforementioned National Culture and Arts Council, without any exception whatsoever concerning officials who were staff representatives in that Ministry.
.ANDIME adds that, on  November , the Undersecretariat of Education proceeded to certify the posts in the Ministry of Education that would be transferred to the new National Culture and Arts Council, including staff in its cultural division, Ms. Marcela Flores Baussa and Ms. Magali del Carmen Rubilar Casanova, ANDIME, officials for San Camilo province level and metropolitan region ministerial secretary in violation of article  of Law No.  which states that union officials may not be moved from their post from the date of their election until six months after the end of their term of office, and also they may not be transferred between localities or functions without their express consent.
.ANDIME states that both transfers challenge their independence and autonomy and constitute an act of unlawful interference by the authority, which has a direct impact on the functioning and administration of ANDIME and is in breach of ILO Convention No.  ratified by Chile.
.ANDIME indicates that, prior to the submission of this complaint, it appealed on  January  to the Comptroller-General of the Republic (Rol ,), but that control body had not issued a decision.
.In its letter of  July , the Government states that Law No.  was published in the Official Journal (Diario Oficial) on  August , creating the National Culture and Arts Council and the National Cultural and Arts Development Fund. It is headed by a president with ministerial rank. The law defines the terms governing the classification of staff in the Council:' Transitional article : The Cultural Extension Division in the Ministry of Education, the Department of Culture in the Government Secretariat, the Secretariat of the Committee for Assessment of Private Donations shall form the National Culture and Arts Council, with resources and personnel, irrespective the latter s legal status.' Transitional article : The President of the Republic is empowered within  days of the date of publication of the present law, to establish the staffing of the National Culture and Arts Council effective from the aforementioned date by a decree with force of law to be issued by the Ministry of Education, and signed by the Minister of Finance.The staffing established shall not result in additional costs, changes in grades or increase in the number of posts provided in the establishment of the Cultural Extension Division and Secretariat of the Committee for Assessment of Private Donations in the Ministry of Education and the Department of Culture in the Government Secretariat from the date of its entry into force. The posts provided shall be certified by the respective undersecretaries. In addition, up to an additional  management or administrative posts may be created.In exercising this authority, the President of the Republic shall issue all the regulations necessary to ensure the proper organization and operation of the established staffing.The staff to which paragraph  refers shall be deemed to be assigned by the sole force of the law, without interruption of service and, from the date of entry into force, the staff assigned to posts in the new establishment shall have the same grade as they held previously.The assignment shall not for any legal purpose constitute termination of service or abolition of jobs or posts nor, in general, cessation of functions or termination of the employment contract. Neither can it entail loss of the benefits set out in article  of Legislative Decree No.  of  in relation to article  of Law No. .Likewise, staff shall conserve the biennial increments acquired and shall retain the length of service in grade for that purpose.For the sole purpose of the application in practice of the assignment set out in the foregoing paragraphs, the President of the Council, by a resolution, shall notify the specific assignment of each staff member within the establishment.
.The Government adds that, under the provisions of Law No. , the Undersecretariat of Education proceeded, through exempt resolution No.  of  August , to certify the posts provided in the establishment of the Ministry of Education. Subsequently, exempt resolution No.  of  November  was issued, which annulled the previous one, and certified the posts held by staff employed in the Ministry of Education Culture Division, where Ms. Marcela Flores Baussa and Ms. Magali del Carmen Rubilar Casanova appear in the professional category, with tenure, scale grade .
.Subsequently, on  January , ANDIME, made representations to the Comptroller-General of the Republic, in which it denounced the Undersecretariat of Education for alleged failure to comply with the legal requirements in the transfer of staff members Ms. Marcela Flores Baussa and Ms. Magali del Carmen Rubilar Casanova from the Ministry of Education to the National Culture and Arts Council. On  April , the Comptroller-General of the Republic replied to ANDIME s representations in Judgement No. . In that judgement, the control body held that the Undersecretariat of Education had acted in accordance with the law, since the administrative measure adopted  ...was based on a mandate from the legislator, in respect of those who were in the situation contemplated in the law, to exercise functions in one of the departments transferred by sole force of law to the new organization that was created'  With respect to the action of the Undersecretary for Education, the Comptroller-General indicates that  ...it is imperative for the implementation of the prescription of the legislator since, otherwise, not only would it mean disobeying an express legal mandate, but it would also alter the procedure ordered for the transfer, and would additionally constitute a serious infringement by the authority as well as a lack of probity and consequent administrative liability'  As regards trade union immunity, a central element in ANDIME S representation, the Comptroller-General of the Republic indicates that  ...this does not apply when it is the law that orders a given measure, as is precisely the case here, in that Law No.  is what orders the disputed transfer' 
.The Government underlines that without prejudice to the judgement of the Comptroller-General, in the sense that the Undersecretariat of Education had acted in accordance with the law, the Ministry decided to accept ANDIME s request to include in the Ministry of Education s establishment the two staff members who were the subject of the complaint to the ILO. In that respect, an administrative arrangement was agreed with the Staff Association of the Ministry of Education (ANDIME) to resolve the situation. This, clearly, is an expression of the Ministry s desire to strengthen the relationship and quality of dialogue with the staff representatives. In the light of the above, the case has been settled directly between the government education authorities and the staff association, ANDIME.
.The Committee observes that, in the present complaint, the complainant organization ANDIME contests the measure taken by the Undersecretariat of Education to transfer two staff members in the Cultural Extension Division of the Ministry of Education, Ms. Marcela Flores Baussa and Ms. Magali del Carmen Rubilar Casanova, to the National Culture and Arts Council, in violation of national legislation and ILO Convention No. , ratified by Chile.
.The Committee notes that the Government states with respect to the transfers that: () the Undersecretariat of Education had acted in accordance with the law in the framework of an administrative reorganization established in Law No. ; () the Comptroller-General of the Republic indicated to ANDIME that trade union immunity (protection of trade union officials against transfer or other prejudicial acts) did not apply since it was the law that ordered the transfer contested in the complaint; () nevertheless, to strengthen the relationship and quality of dialogue, the ministerial authority had decided to accept ANDIME s request and reinstate the trade union officials, Ms. Marcela Flores Baussa and Ms.",0,2004,Chile

.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the matter which gave rise to the present complaint has been settled directly between the authorities and the complainant organization.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2004,Chile
117,".The Government sent new observations in communications dated  and  February,  March and  April .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:As to the allegations related to the violent repression of the national strike of  August , the Committee, taking into account the lack of information concerning the allegations referred to by the Government, will not proceed with the examination of these allegations, unless the complainants communicate the information requested by the Government.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the National Inter-enterprise Union of Metallurgy, Communications, Energy and Allied Workers (SME), dated  November  and  January and  February , and in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (Regional Office, Americas) dated  March . The SME sent additional information and new allegations in communications dated  May,  June and  September. The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  June . The PLASTYVERG consortium sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the National Inter-enterprise Union of Metallurgy, Communications, Energy and Allied Workers (SME) alleges anti-union practices in the PLASTYVERG conglomerate, dismissal by one of the enterprises of the group (the Promociones Packs y Ofertas S.A. enterprise) of trade union delegates Jos Saavedra Araya ( September ) and Luis Labarca Lazo ( September ) and trade union member Pablo Villavicencio; Luis Martnez, a trade union delegate in the Center Packs enterprise, was also dismissed, although he was subsequently reinstated (being covered by trade union immunity) but transferred to another workplace; this enterprise then asked trade union delegate Luis Martnez Duarte to withdraw from the trade union and to set up a separate group of workers; Mr. Martnez Duarte refused and the Promociones Packs y Ofertas S.A. enterprise then appointed a staff delegate in the enterprise, and got a group of workers to sign this nomination after offering them economic advantages; at the same time, the enterprise began to pressure the trade union members to withdraw from membership and join the abovementioned group of workers.
.In October , the SME, as the inter-enterprise trade union, submitted draft collective agreements to the different enterprises in the PLASTYVERG group, which refused to accept them and continued to pressure workers to withdraw from the trade union and from the bargaining process. Later the draft agreements were presented as coming from groups of workers (as prescribed by law). The Promociones Packs y Ofertas S.A. enterprise accepted the list of demands from the staff delegate (who was appointed by the enterprise, as mentioned above). In view of the above, the SME filed complaints with the labour inspectorate; pressure to withdraw from membership and from collective bargaining continued; trade union delegate Rafael San Martn Artete was assigned different duties, and sent to package rolls and threatened with a pay cut. On  November , the general manager of the PLASTYVERG group informed trade union delegate Sergio Cornejo Durn that the workers would have to withdraw from the trade union once the collective bargaining process was completed.
.In its communications dated  March and  May , respectively, the World Federation of Trade Unions (Regional Office, Americas) and the SME allege that SME members Antonio Cordero and Juan Muoz were dismissed for refusing to consent to the PLASTYVERG enterprise s demand to resign  voluntarily'  on grounds of the requirements of the enterprise'  In addition, as a result of pressure and constant harassment by the enterprise, union members Nelson Araneda, Vctor Viera, Jos Vera, Fernando Martnez, Jos Poblete, Ramn Lizama and Hctor Gonzlez gave in and, after being dismissed, consented to sign so-called  voluntary resignations'  the enterprise then hired fewer workers. The enterprise had already notified the workers that anyone who participated in collective bargaining would be dismissed once their period of statutory immunity expired.
.Starting on Monday,  March, of this year, after receiving from the employers' association (SOFOFA) a copy of the complaints submitted by the trade union to the ILO, the enterprise obliged workers to sign a blank document in letter format. All of the workers were threatened with dismissal if they did not support the enterprise with their signature. The threat went,  if you want to continue working, sign' and was issued by line managers or supervisors. A worker who refused would be dismissed  on grounds of the requirements of the enterprise' according to section  of the Labour Code, as happened to worker Vladimir Castillo.
.Demanding their signature, representatives of the enterprise presented each worker, one by one, at the workplace, with a letter from the enterprise and the employers' organization SOFOFA to the International Labour Organization. The letter referred to the complaint of  November  submitted to the ILO by the trade union against the State of Chile for violation of international labour Conventions Nos.  and . Up to Thursday,  March, faced with this situation and the total lack of protection against anti-union dismissal, the trade union had advised workers to sign if they were pressured to do so, since this confirmed the existence of anti-union practices. Using this method, by  March ,  signatures of workers in different areas had been collected for purposes of which the complainant organization is not aware, but they are believed to be intended to counter the arguments put forward in the complaint.
.In the same circumstances, since Wednesday,  March , the enterprise and the staff delegates appointed by it have ordered workers to sign a letter that has already been drafted, in which the signatories express their alleged opposition to the trade union, demanding that the trade union delegates be censured. There are three staff delegates appointed by the enterprise who have participated in the collection of signatures to censure trade union delegates (this is the term used in Chilean legislation to refer to workers' representatives); none of them is a trade union member, and they participate in all of the anti-union actions undertaken by the enterprise.
.According to the complainant organization, all of these processes were set in motion by the fact that on  March a copy of the formal complaint of  November  presented to the ILO fell into the hands of PLASTYVERG s management, unleashing a wave of actions against freedom of association by the enterprise, to the grave detriment of the workers. The trade union is now awaiting the outcome of an initial complaint filed with the courts covering the first six months of anti-union practices by this enterprise.
.The following trade union members employed by the enterprises of the PLASTYVERG group have had to stop working for the company: Fernando Martnez (Center Packs), Vctor Viera (Promo Packs), Jos Poblete (Center Packs), Ramn Lizama (Promo Packs), Nelson Araneda (PLASTYVERG), Vladimir Castillo (Promo Packs), Jos Vera Vera (Promo Packs), Antonio Cordero Espinoza (Center Packs) Hctor Gonzlez (Promo Packs), Juan Carlos Muoz (Promo Packs). Some agreed to sign so-called voluntary resignations ' which are not in fact voluntary ' in return for which they received a pay rise after having been constantly harassed and dismissed with the aim of disguising the anti-union practice. Two of these workers refused to resign and were dismissed on grounds of the requirements of the enterprise ? their posts were taken by other workers.
.In its communication of  June , the SME alleges that the following trade union members were dismissed on  May  on grounds of  the requirements of the enterprise' (section  of the Labour Code): Mario Sandoval, Guillermo Prez, Jorge Cerda and Alex Delgado. The enterprise has already hired other workers in the positions of those who were dismissed. The trade union requested the labour directorate to take note of these practices in violation of freedom of association, which have become even worse in the PLASTYVERG enterprise.
.Lastly, in its communications of  January and  February , the SME sends allegations concerning violations of trade union rights by the HERPA S.A., Vias Tarapac y Santa Helena enterprise and the CODELCO state enterprise.
.The SME alleges that on  May , the workers employed by the Spanish multinational HERPA S.A. Chile elected Mr. Nstor Carrasco as their trade union delegate. The enterprise refused to recognize the SME and the trade union delegate, who was dismissed, and later had to be reinstated by court order. At the trade union s request, the Labour Directorate carried out an inspection on  September , as a result of which it fined the enterprise for failure to pay remuneration, non-compliance with security regulations and unlawful dismissal of a trade union delegate covered",0,2003,Chile
118,"by trade union immunity. On  October , a vote was held to elect a bargaining committee to begin negotiations, and the following workers were elected: Nstor Carrasco, Marcos Rojas and Andrs Snchez. The next day, the enterprise unlawfully dismissed Alberto Carrasco, Marcos Rojas and Jaime Vera, all members of the SME, in order to prevent the workers from achieving the quorum required to initiate bargaining. On  December , a request was made for an inspection of the enterprise on grounds of anti-union practices: failure to assign the work agreed in the contract; transfer of the trade union delegate to other duties; hiring workers to illegally replace unionized workers; separation of reinstated workers from the rest of the workers at lunchtime to prevent them from communicating among themselves; and threats of dismissal against unionized workers.
.The enterprise continued to harass Nstor Carrasco in order to get him to resign from the union and the enterprise. Finally, he submitted a  voluntary' resignation to the San Bernardo Labour Inspectorate on  December . On  January  the enterprise accepted some of the points raised in collective bargaining but rejected all the rest. On the next day, the Labour Directorate was notified of the termination of negotiations, in particular because the employer refused to agree to any wage increase. On  January a legal strike began, during which the workers held a sit-in in the enterprise. The courts turned down the enterprise s request to evict the workers and confirmed that the workers were within their rights. The enterprise lodged an appeal for protection of constitutional rights (amparo) with the Court of Appeals, which is still pending. Since the beginning of the strike, the enterprise refused to meet with trade union leaders. On  January, inspectors attempted to evict the workers, alleging that the strike was illegal. On  February, the enterprise hired  strike-breakers from a security company. A complaint was filed against this situation with the labour inspectorate, which took note of the violation and ordered that these workers be removed from the enterprise.
.On  February the workers again held a peaceful sit-in at the enterprise at . a.m. At . a.m., a police unit arrived on the scene, but the workers refused to be evicted from the enterprise in the absence of a court order. Later, police reinforcements arrived in large numbers and evicted the workers by force, using considerable and disproportionate violence against the five workers who were in the enterprise. As a result, three workers were seriously injured, and all of them were detained, together with three workers who were offering their support. The police used more than  officers, a vehicle equipped with a water cannon, a vehicle equipped with a tear gas launcher and three police cars, two motorcycles and the application of tear gas. Up to the date of the complaint, police officers remained stationed in the enterprise, in a move to intimidate the workers on strike.
.The complainant organization alleges that these acts occur because of connivance between major export enterprises and the multinationals that provide production services to them, in the absence of appropriate measures by the State to put an end to such practices. The authorities confine themselves to imposing minor fines on enterprises found guilty of violations, but do not put an end to the violation. The SME alleges further that the Vias Tarapac and Santa Helena enterprises are also guilty of having allowed strike-breakers to come and work in their installations to replace the striking workers employed by HERPA S.A.
.The SME points out further that the CODELCO state enterprise, Mina El Teniente division, in Rancagua, region VI, hires subcontractors to work their copper mines, and the latter hire further subcontractors in turn. The CODELCO enterprise thus does not have contractual relationships with all of the miners working in the areas owned by it. The SME alleges that in November  these enterprises refused to engage in collective bargaining. The Provincial Labour Inspectorate changed its original stance and now supports the subcontractors, citing orders issued by the Labour Directorate itself, which have not been approved by Parliament and which entail in practice an amendment of legislation, since they deny the right to bargain collectively to thousands of unionized workers.
.Various attempts by the Inter-enterprise Trade Union of Workers of the CODELCO Enterprises (SITELCO) to set up a joint body to seek possible solutions with representatives of the enterprise were rejected on the grounds that the enterprise does not have contractual relationships with the workers. CODELCO refuses to recognize the trade union and has even filed a lawsuit against it, considering it an illegal association.
.Shortly after the draft collective agreement was presented to the CODELCO subcontractors, Mina El Teniente division, three of the union s leaders were beaten in the public thoroughfare  so that they would stop causing problems'  At the beginning of December , the CODELCO enterprise prevented union leaders from going to the worksites where its members were working. On  December, workers employed by the subcontractors started a sit-in strike to get the enterprises to negotiate with the trade union on the draft collective agreement. Apparently as a result of CODELCO s intervention, the enterprises rejected the proposal and said that they would only negotiate with staff delegates, excluding the trade union.
.During discussions at the worksite, the enterprises proposed a particular form of bargaining (enterprise by enterprise) with a trade union presence. Although this proposal was accepted by the trade union, the enterprises subsequently withdrew their proposal. On the afternoon of  December the workers peacefully occupied the main entrances to the mine. There were no cases of persons attacked or security endangered. In the morning of  December, the workers received an ultimatum from the enterprise ordering them to leave the mine. Without attempting to negotiate a solution, about two hours later the workers were attacked by police using truncheons, firearms and -gauge shotguns with rubber-coated steel bullets or shot.
.A total of  workers were injured, some of them seriously. The worker Enzo Prez was hit by  shots. Police arrested  strikers (including the wounded) and released them on the afternoon of the same day. The police succeeded in breaking the strike and evicting the workers.
.As of the date on which the complaint was presented,  workers had been dismissed for participating in this action. CODELCO called for dismissal of the striking workers and their inclusion on blacklists so that they would not be able to return to its premises or work for its subcontractors.
.The SME alleges that there was no court order to evict the strikers and that the police acted illegally on behalf of the CODELCO state enterprise, as it had on many other occasions.
.The SME emphasizes that the contract workers' real employer is CODELCO, which is jointly responsible for the obligations of its subcontractors towards its workers, including with regard to trade union rights. It adds that, as CODELCO is a state enterprise, the State also bears responsibility for the anti-union measures.
.In its communication dated  September , which was also signed by the National Confederation of Construction Workers (CNTC), the National Confederation of Healthcare Workers (CONFENATS), the National Association of Workers of the Youth Protection Service (ANTRASE), the Metropolitan College of Teachers (CRP), the National Confederation of Road Transport Workers (CONUTT), the National Inter-enterprise Trade Union of Commercial, Textile, Garment and Allied Workers (SCTV) and the National Inter-enterprise Trade Union of Security Guards, Watchmen and General Services and Allied Workers, the SME alleges that the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT), during the May Day celebrations in , called on Chilean workers to hold a nationwide -hour strike on  August . The workers observed the strike and participated actively; in all of the cities throughout the country there were demonstrations, stoppages and blockages caused by marches and demonstrations of workers, of which the authorities had been duly informed in advance. In order to avoid serious harm to the public, the different trade unions and professional associations maintained emergency services, for example in public health services; even teachers ensured that poor pupils were served meals in schools. The trade union leadership and members had carried out their preparations with a great deal of responsibility and forethought. The Chilean workers had presented their list of demands, entitled  For a fair Chile'  explaining the reasons and demands behind the national strike, at a meeting held in September  with the President of the Republic and his ministers. The reasons and demands are as follows:' against growing and unfair social inequalities;' against the application of an economic model that generates unemployment and makes work more precarious;' the authorities should enforce labour law, because over one-half of the enterprises systematically violate it;' put a stop to blatant anti-union persecution and guarantee workers the right to form trade unions freely and without threats;' ensure that workers can engage in genuine collective bargaining, because this right does not exist in practice;' reject the changes",-1,2003,Chile
119,"in maternity leave for working women;' decent jobs, with decent wages and social security;' genuine and real social protection for all workers, whether dependent or self-employed;' in protest against the anti-worker policies of the Government of Chile;' for a reform of the labour court system, given that labour court proceedings lasted years.
.Previously, at a public meeting in August , the leadership of the CUT had presented their proposals and demands to the highest authorities, and the President of the Republic had assigned the Minister of Labour the task of examining the organization s proposals in September . The day before the strike, on  August, the President of the Republic criticized the call for a strike, saying he was unaware of the reasons for the action taken by the trade union confederation, thus displaying the Government s lack of interest and callousness.
.On the eve of the strike, the Government started discrediting this action by the workers, denying its legitimacy. At the same time, the police began their first acts of repression against the trade unionists. For example, on Friday,  August, the CUT s National Adviser, Sergio Troncoso, and the national leader of the Trade Union of Contingent Workers and Unemployed Persons, Pedro Muoz, were detained by police officers for distributing information leaflets on the national strike. They were released after spending three hours in the police station. All of the propaganda materials were confiscated.
.In the run-up to the strike, the Ministers of Health and Education issued threats to public sector workers intending to participate in this trade union action. For example, on  July, the Secretary of Health wrote the following letter to his staff:  I inform you that this state secretariat does not approve of the total or partial interruption or stoppage of activities ... Accordingly, I instruct you ... to have recourse ... to the use of the police forces'  Similarly, the Secretary of Education, Sergio Bitar, and other senior government officials threatened public employees who participated in the national strike with detrimental consequences, such as disciplinary proceedings and pay deductions.
.The obvious aim of these intimidation tactics by government authorities was to frighten the workers into not exercising their rights. Similar threats and intimidation were also carried out by the Minister of Transport, who even threatened the workers with a fine and demanded that bus owners dismiss bus transport workers who participated in the strike. The first wave of police violence occurred early on in the strike, forcing the workers to go to work. The government authorities warned employers to hire strike-breakers to break the national strike; metro employees were forced to work -hour days.
.As had already happened in previous public demonstrations, three masked youths, who were not involved in the workers' marches, appeared punctually on the morning of  August, obstructing the public thoroughfare in the vicinity of the column of marching workers. The police did not detain the masked youths, but they did attack and detain leaders and workers who were peacefully marching. On the following day, official statistics mentioned  four instances of serious disturbances of public order and damage to public property'  These isolated occurrences, which were unrelated to the six blockages formed in different parts of the city to peacefully urge workers not to work and to participate in the national strike, served as a motive and a pretext to launch an army of thousands of police officers deployed in the capital.
.The police officers were fully equipped to repress a rebellious crowd: combat gear, armoured trucks, a large number of water cannons and huge quantities of a powerful new type of tear-gas bomb. This huge police arsenal was not used to detain the isolated vandals, but to attack groups of demonstrators who were attempting to approach CUT headquarters. Some of the groups could not leave because the police had closed off the streets that the demonstrators had been authorized to march through. The others suffered ill treatment to an unprecedented extent. All the weaponry that had been brought in to repress and intimidate the demonstrators was put to violent and brutal use. The marching columns were dispersed using water cannons and even small groups of demonstrators were pelted with tear-gas bombs, and the police indiscriminately detained participants. The police were seen literally hunting people down for no reason other than the aim of carrying out an attack of unprecedented violence to destroy any organized movement. None of the groups of demonstrators managed to reach CUT headquarters in an organized manner.
.Anyone who came near the CUT premises, whether dispersed members of the groups of demonstrators or individuals, was attacked with water cannons containing chemicals or with tear gas. During the attacks on workers in front of the CUT building, water cannons were aimed as high as the second floor of the building, where the president and secretary-general of the CUT had their offices. This was where the officers targeted most of their tear gas attacks. In addition, as the secretary-general of the CUT and the president of the SME, together with teachers, health workers, transport workers, commercial workers, copper miners and other leaders was addressing the workers outside the premises of the CUT, he was assaulted by police with water canons containing chemicals, for no reason at all.
.The way in which the members of the police forces had been prepared is further reflected in their behaviour throughout the rest of the day. All of the attempts to organize a trade union event had already come to a halt, the public thoroughfares were open and there were only a few hours left until the planned end of the strike. Some incidents occurred in a district south of Santiago. Outside the area where the incidents occurred, some police officers fired rubber bullets for no reason at a private house through the window and put an entire family at risk, inflicted a gunshot wound on one person, and fired tear gas at houses from  p.m. onwards. In another area of the capital, police armoured cars were brought out. These acts clearly demonstrate a deliberate intention to attack and provoke. This, and not the isolated incidents which occurred, was the most dangerous aspect of the entire day.
.There are no exact figures on the number of persons injured as a result of the criminal attacks perpetrated by the police forces. A number of workers who suffered physical injury have instituted proceedings against those responsible for truly criminal acts perpetrated against their physical integrity; the leaders lodged a complaint against the attack on the premises of the CUT, as well as an appeal for protection for a detained person who was tortured in a police station in southern Santiago.
.The Governor of the Metropolitan Region of Santiago himself threatened to dismiss workers in the metropolitan administration if they participated in the strike and, in a speech made early in the morning over the media, pointed out that such actions always resulted in fatalities. In the Youth Protection Service an order was issued to draw up lists of the participants in the national strike, and this was announced to employees so that they would refrain from taking part in the strike.
.The authorities stated that there was no reason for the strike because they had already met one of the CUT s demands, which was to send draft legislation reforming the labour court system; this was announced publicly before the strike but was not true, as was made clear by the Chamber of Deputies, which stated that the draft had only been received in Parliament in October and was still pending in Congress.
.The public peaceful demonstration held by the trade unions did not give any justification whatsoever for the use of brute force by the police against demonstrators.
.After the events of  August, a complaint was filed under the Internal Security Act and because of a bus that had been burned, and this was widely publicized in the press, creating a climate of uncertainty, in an attempt to link these acts with the strike, whereas the CUT had called a national strike and its entire leadership had made every effort to organize the activities so as to avoid acts by agents provocateurs and members of the police who infiltrated the demonstration.
.A teachers' leader, Marcela Mallea Bustos, who was evicted together with other teachers from the Liceo de San Pedro in the metropolitan region for having actively participated in the strike, was dismissed; her sister Patricia Mallea Bustos, also a teacher, was dismissed as well in reprisal.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government states that the complaint made by the National Inter-enterprise Union of Metallurgy, Communications, Energy and Allied Workers (SME) refers to violations of trade union rights alleged to have occurred in the PLASTYVERG group of enterprises. This group is comprised of the following enterprises: Inmobiliaria La Vergara, Poli Packs, Promociones Packs y Ofertas S.A. and Center Packs.
.The allegations basically concern, on the one hand, pressure brought to bear by enterprises against trade union delegates of",-1,2003,Chile
120,"the abovementioned trade union and, on the other, refusal by enterprises to engage in collective bargaining, and during the process of bargaining, exerting pressure aimed at discouraging participation by the abovementioned trade union.
.In this respect, according to information in possession of the Labour Directorate, the trade union in question, in accordance with section bis of the Labour Code, presented draft collective agreements to the enterprises in the group, which, in accordance with the authority conferred on them by the same provisions, expressed their refusal to bargain collectively with the complainant trade union. Section bis of the Labour Code specifies that it is optional for enterprises to bargain with an inter-enterprise trade union:Section bis. Notwithstanding the provisions in the second paragraph of section , an inter-enterprise trade union may present a draft collective agreement on behalf of its members and workers who join the trade union, to employers employing workers who are members of that trade union; the latter shall be empowered to sign the collective agreements concerned.In order to present such a draft, the trade union is required to do so on behalf of at least four workers in each enterprise.In this context, negotiations were started by a group of workers, in accordance with the general regulations on the subject. The drafts were presented on the same day on which the employers stated their refusal to negotiate. All of them had to be notified by the labour inspectorate on the following dates: Promo Packs ( October ), Center Packs ( October ), Poli Packs ( October ) and Inmobiliaria La Vergara ( October ).
.The workers complained of failure by the enterprises to communicate with the rest of the workers, as provided by section  of the Labour Code, and this was confirmed by the labour inspectorate. Section  of the Labour Code reads as follows;Section . The employer shall notify all the other workers of the enterprise that a draft collective agreement has been presented, and the workers shall have a time limit of  days, counting from the date on which the notification was made, to present drafts in the form and under the conditions laid down in this Book or to support the draft that was presented.The last day of the period referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be understood as the date on which all the drafts are presented, for purposes of calculating the time limits prescribed in this Book for responding to the drafts and initiating negotiations.The employers communicated their reply to the bargaining committees of Promo Packs and Center Packs on  November . These committees had until  November to formulate objections as to legality. The employers acted in conformity with the law with regard to the presentation of these drafts, given that, in their view, the bargaining committees had not been appointed in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code, which reads as follows:Section . Representation of workers in collective bargaining shall be carried out by a bargaining committee composed as indicated below.If the draft collective agreement is presented by a trade union, the bargaining committee shall be the executive committee of that trade union, and, if a number of trade unions made a joint presentation, the committee will consist of the officers of all of them.If a draft collective agreement is presented by a group of workers joining together for the sole purpose of bargaining, a bargaining committee shall be set up in accordance with the following rules:(a) in order to be elected as a member of the bargaining committee, the candidate shall meet the same requirements as those for being an officer of a trade union;(b) the bargaining committee shall consist of three members. However, if the bargaining unit consists of at least  workers, five members may be appointed; if it consists of at least , workers, seven members may be appointed; and if it consists of at least , workers, nine may be appointed.(c) the members of the bargaining committee shall be elected by secret ballot, which shall be held in the presence of a certifying officer, if there are at least  workers; and(d) each worker shall have the right to two, three, four or five votes (which cannot be accumulated) depending on whether the bargaining committee consists of three, five, seven or nine members, respectively.The employer shall have the right to be represented in the negotiations by up to three agents who belong to the enterprise, which may also be understood to include members of its board of directors and partners authorized to manage the enterprise.
.In this context, the bargaining committees failed to avail themselves, within the time limit, of the possibility of formulating objections and, hence, in accordance with the doctrine, including that contained in Decision No. / of  June , this was understood as signifying their acceptance of the employers' reply and observations. Notwithstanding the above, in both enterprises a collective agreement was signed for a term expiring on  August , of which the labour inspectorate was notified by the enterprises on  January .
.With respect to the collective bargaining involving the other two enterprises, i.e. Inmobiliaria La Vergara and Poli Packs, the employers discharged their obligation to inform the other workers, in accordance with section , and this was confirmed by inspectors during an inspection visit.
.On  December , the employer sent a copy of the replies communicated on  November and  December, respectively. In its reply to the draft collective agreement, the first enterprise made certain observations as to legality, impugning one of the members of the bargaining committee as a person who was not employed by the enterprise, as well as the lack of a quorum to bargain, given that the draft was accompanied by a list of four workers. The bargaining committee also formulated its own objections as to legality. The reply of the second enterprise also referred to the absence of a quorum, since only four workers were involved.
.In regard to the above replies, the Maipo District Labour Inspectorate issued Decisions Nos.  and , both dated  December , taking note of the lack of a quorum to negotiate. Notwithstanding the above, the bargaining committees requested a certifying officer to vote on the last offer or a strike, but this request was not accepted by the labour inspectorate.
.Notwithstanding the above, the Labour Directorate considered, in accordance with the law, that the lack of the necessary quorum to negotiate, which was not denied during the time limit by the bargaining committees, necessarily entails termination of the bargaining process, and hence the workers were no longer covered by immunity and there were no grounds to initiate an investigation to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, but there was reason to open an investigation on the grounds of anti-union practices.
.As a result of that investigation, it was confirmed that pressure had been brought to bear by the enterprises in regard to the election of staff delegates and that trade union members had been pressured to withdraw from the union during the collective bargaining process.
.This investigation led to the filing of a complaint of anti-union practices, Case No.  of , which was examined by the First Court of the First Instance of San Bernardo, which has recently handed down its judgement, which is not yet final, upholding the part of the complaint concerning undue pressure on the workers to resign from union membership, ordering that this conduct cease and imposing a fine of  monthly tax units on the enterprise. It did not uphold the complaint referring to employer interference in the election of the staff delegate. A second complaint has been filed on this subject by the executive committee of the Inter-enterprise Trade Union, and this is currently under investigation.
.On  April  the operations manager of the PLASTYVERG enterprise reported by telephone that premises of the enterprise had been taken over by five trade union delegates and four workers, supported from outside by a group of about  persons, and the situation was dealt with through the intervention of police officers, who only acted by their presence.
.On  March  the executive committee of the Inter-enterprise Trade Union presented to the Labour Directorate a copy of a note sent to the Governor of the Metropolitan Region, requesting that the police forces refrain from intervening in the demonstrations that the workers would be carrying out in protest against the anti-union dismissals.
.Lastly, at the meeting held on  April  between the Director for Labour and the Exporters' Association, to which the PLASTYVERG group is affiliated, it was agreed that mediation be offered as an alternative means of solving the disputes that had arisen between the enterprises and the trade union, and this issue will be taken up in the near future.
.As regards the suggestion to request information from the employers' organization concerned, so that the Committee on Freedom of Association might take its views into consideration, as well as those of the",2,2003,Chile
121,"PLASTYVERG group, the Confederation of Production and Trade (CPC), the employers' highest level organization, was consulted, and it transmitted the request to the president of the PLASTYVERG group, who submitted a file containing a considerable amount of information and photocopies of supporting documents, and giving the point of view of the enterprise and the employers' organization in reply to the complaint presented to the ILO. According to the enterprise:' Mr. Jos Saavedra committed a serious breach of his duties under his employment contract by getting drunk on  September  as he was carrying out his normal tasks, and said that he would seriously damage the enterprise if he were dismissed; in addition, he used vehicles belonging to the enterprise without authorization, photocopied confidential information and spoke disrespectfully to the manager and deputy manager; he had threatened to shoot a worker in the presence of others. For all of these reasons, he was dismissed and asked to leave the house that had been provided during the employment relationship, and was provided with other accommodation (for up to  days until he found somewhere to live), in which he would not have direct access to confidential information. Only on  September was the enterprise provided with formal certification that Mr. Saavedra and Mr. Luis Labarca had been elected as trade union delegates on  September.' Given the recalcitrance and lack of commitment displayed by Mr. Luis Labarca in his duties as nightwatchman and guard, during which he allowed free access to the installations to Mr. Saavedra, failed to carry out his night rounds, etc., the enterprise decided to terminate the employment contract on  September, of which he was informed, and his severance pay was calculated, with all the wages due. Upon being notified he submitted a copy of certificate No.  of the labour inspectorate certifying that he and Mr. Saavedra were trade union delegates, and hence the dismissal was annulled in view of the trade union immunity he enjoys as a delegate. Mr. Labarca s refusal to discharge his duties at work prompted the enterprise to issue a communication dated  September requesting him to improve his conduct and discharge his duties to the best of his ability. On  October Mr. Labarca decided to resign from the enterprise for strictly personal reasons which did not allow him to carry out his duties properly and, in addition, requested an increase in his severance pay in relation to an outstanding debt with a compensation fund. The enterprise accepted his request and his employment was terminated on  October in the presence of a notary. He also resigned as trade union leader. Copies of these documents are attached.' In the light of the above, one has the impression that Mr. Saavedra and Mr. Luis Labarca were using the trade union to negotiate their departures and gain financial advantages from their trade union office. These facts prompted dozens of members to resign from the trade union, as all the workers had witnessed the bad faith displayed by these trade union leaders.' Concerning the dismissal of Mr. Pablo Villavicencio, allegedly a member of the Inter enterprise Trade Union, this took place on  September and it was only on  October, i.e.  days later, that the Inter-enterprise Trade Union submitted the list of members together with the draft collective agreement. Prior to that date, the enterprise was not aware of the list of members of the trade union. Finally, with the workers' consent, his employment was terminated in the presence of a notary, by mutual agreement between the parties. His termination agreement is attached.' Similarly, in the case of Mr. Daniel Gonzlez, the worker signed his termination agreement in the presence of a notary on the grounds of mutual consent of the parties, on  October, and it was only on  October that the list of trade union members including his name was presented; it is patently untrue that his electricity and water supply were cut off. His termination agreement, on grounds of mutual consent of the parties, is attached.' In the case of the worker Luis Martinez, the enterprise decided to terminate his employment contract on  September. Only five days later, on  September, the worker presented a certificate stating that he was elected as a trade union delegate on  September, prior to the dismissal, and he was therefore reinstated in the enterprise. Since the worker had been away from his post for five days, and shifts had been reorganized to cover his absence, he was assigned to another workplace. The worker expressed his disagreement, and therefore the enterprise reassigned him to his previous post and he withdrew his complaint on  October, having been transferred to his original post. Supporting documents are attached, including documents in which this worker and four other trade unionists agreed to terminate their employment relationship and waive all legal claims.' Given the pressure and hostile climate in the enterprise caused by the presence of a bus broadcasting slogans over loudspeakers and notices referring to a strike in the enterprise, the workers who were not members of the Inter-enterprise Trade Union decided to organize themselves quickly and appointed staff delegates, including Mr. Gerardo Daz. This initiative by the majority culminated on  October, when the workers presented lists of signatures and tax registration numbers to the labour inspectorate, to officially ratify the election of the staff delegates. Each list clearly identified the enterprise in question and the identity of the staff delegate whom the workers supported. Mr. Daz sent a copy of the communication presented to the labour inspectorate on the same day, and all the head of the personnel department did was to inform the rest of the organization that Mr. Gerardo Daz had been elected as staff delegate.' The enterprise had never refused to receive its workers, much less trade union or staff delegates. Given that the enterprise had exercised its statutory right under section bisA to refrain from bargaining with the Inter-enterprise Trade Union and given the pressure brought to bear by that trade union in the form of telephone calls to enterprise managers outside office hours, etc., it was decided that persons outside the enterprise would not be received, while keeping the channels of communication with all of its employees open.' At the same time as the election of staff delegates in accordance with the law was presented (confirmed by the labour inspectorate), the workers submitted to the enterprise a number of demands reflecting the concerns of the workers they represented, and the enterprise, bearing in mind the tough competition the enterprise was facing, but aware of its workers' needs and the reasonable nature of their demands, decided to accede to them. These demands mainly focused on compensation for the loss of purchasing power of their remuneration. In accordance with the agreement signed by the staff delegates, the workers who had not received wage increases in the last year were granted the equivalent of  per cent of the consumer price index for the last  months. It was also agreed that they would receive another increase a year later and that they would be issued with work clothes according to a fixed schedule. These staff delegates were freely elected from among their peers and are not a group of workers having close ties to the enterprise, as the complaint disparagingly puts it, but a group of workers representing more than  per cent of the enterprise workforce, who defended their enterprise against leaders that do not represent their interests and do not care about the welfare of the enterprise or its workers, or about maintaining a good working climate.' On  October, the Inter-enterprise Trade Union presented a draft collective agreement, and the enterprise, acting in accordance with the law and within the legal time limit of ten days, exercised the right conferred on it by section bisA, according to which it is optional for the employer to negotiate with the Inter enterprise Trade Union, and accordingly opted not to bargain with the union. On the same day,  October, after the enterprise had stated its intention not to negotiate with the Inter-enterprise Union, the group of workers who were members of that union presented the same draft collective agreement, with the same format and with the same letterhead of the Inter-enterprise Trade Union, without showing any evidence that they had met to elect a bargaining committee as provided by section  of the Labour Code. A number of members of this trade union expressed surprise at this new presentation of a collective agreement and of persons elected as the bargaining committee, saying that they had not been consulted to that end.' Given the degree of verbal and written violence and the intervention of persons from outside the enterprise who disturbed the workers with trucks fitted with loudspeakers, and notice boards and the publication of articles in a CUT newspaper, it was decided not to allow access to",-1,2003,Chile
122,"internal files used by the enterprise to publish production statistics, communications on ISO standards, internal communications, etc. Meanwhile, in response to this external intervention, most of the workers increasingly supported the staff delegates, seeing the way in which the enterprise was being attacked and prevented from working peacefully and reaching agreement with the workers to ensure the smooth running of the enterprise. Many workers decided to resign from the Inter-enterprise Trade Union, but the latter refused to accept their resignation. In December , an article appeared in the newspaper Chile Justo, mentioning that that trade union was submitting a complaint against the State of Chile. In its complaint, it stated that, on  November, the general manager told Mr. Sergio Cornejo to withdraw from the trade union, which is absolutely untrue. What is true is that the workers continued to resign from the outsider trade union because it came from outside the enterprise and behaved badly.' In its reply to the draft collective agreement, the enterprise levelled serious objections as to its legality in terms of form and substance with regard to the manner in which it was presented and handled, and the workers' group did not contest the enterprise s observations within the legal time limit and, hence, according to section , the collective agreement is taken to have not been presented. This is even more clear if one considers that, in communication No.  dated  November, the Maipo labour inspectorate set the time limits for each step of the bargaining process; the enterprise then sent a letter to the labour inspectorate requesting a decision on what had been stated in the Labour Relations Unit of the labour inspectorate concerning the fact that the workers' group had not contested or expressed its views on the serious objections as to legality formulated by the enterprise, the silence of the bargaining committee was taken to mean acceptance of the objections, thus putting an end to the bargaining process. Decision No.  of the labour inspectorate clearly states that the bargaining committee of the workers' group presented its objections after the time limit had expired. The bargaining process is a regulated process and therefore a minimum amount of requirements and time limits clearly have to be observed by both parties; this was not done by the bargaining committee of the workers' group.' Notwithstanding the above, the workers held an illegal vote on  January , accompanied by considerable publicity and pressure on the workers to vote for the strike or face fines and penalties. This election was attended by staff from the San Bernardo labour inspectorate, sent by the central office of the labour inspectorate, for the sole purpose of serving as certifying officer,' Given the circumstances, and despite its conviction that the bargaining process had ended and that the workers' bargaining committee had failed to meet the requirements for a regulated bargaining process, and that the labour inspectorate was not putting a stop to illegal acts, the enterprise decided, on  January, to mediate between the parties, so as not to obstruct labour relations with its workers. However, although the trade union leaders had been advised verbally by management, they held an illegal strike on Monday,  January, for two hours, obstructing free access by workers until members of the labour inspectorate arrived and summoned them in writing to mediation. This negative attitude is not conducive to good relations between employer and workers. All of this disappointed its members who continued to resign from the trade union.' After seven days of negotiations in the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of the labour directorate, the workers' and the employer s representatives agreed to sign a collective agreement on Tuesday,  January .' Ever since the collective agreement was presented by the Inter-enterprise Trade Union in October , the enterprise has been subjected to several inspections by the labour inspectorate: over  visits have been carried out by inspectors to date, including on Sundays, during which they requested access to individual documentation on each worker, whereas on Sunday the personnel department is closed and documentation can only be removed in emergencies; however, the infringement was notified.' Many workers, seeing the persecution and harassment against the enterprise by persons linked to the Inter-enterprise Trade Union, wished to resign from the union in order to support the staff delegates, but were prevented from doing so, as their resignation was not accepted, and they turned to the enterprise management, but it was unable to do anything as this would be construed as anti-union practices. The workers were merely advised to consult the labour inspectorate, since, in accordance with the principle of freedom of association enshrined in article  of the Chilean Constitution and Conventions Nos.  and  of the International Labour Organization, workers are entitled to exercise their right to join or withdraw from a trade union whenever they deem it to be in their interests; this is not the case in the present situation, since the Inter-enterprise Trade Union is not allowing them to resign freely. These are also  anti-union practices' and should be penalized as such.' To date many applications to resign from the outsider trade union have been rejected, and the workers have presented them again. They have even requested the trade union s by-laws, but this was refused, contrary to the workers' rights and freedom of association.' The degree of violence and harassment has reached the stage where, on  March , pamphlets were being distributed in the private residence of the general manager and his neighbours, accusing him of being  a lying exploiter'  a  specialist in anti-union practices'  etc. This constitutes blatant slander and libel. They also contained a demand for compliance with the collective agreement, whereas the enterprise had never stopped complying with the agreement that had been signed. The watchword is reinstatement of two dismissed workers, who are being paid their severance pay in full, but the Inter-enterprise Trade Union argues that it was not consulted before the workers were dismissed and that in future it will have to be consulted on any dismissal.' In fact, the enterprise has every intention of working in harmony with its workers and fully complying with the terms of the collective agreement with the group of workers who are members of the trade union; what is more, it has extended to the entire enterprise the benefits obtained by the staff delegates, to ensure that the workers are treated equally. The staff delegates have the support of some  per cent of the entire workforce of the enterprise. In this connection, the Committee on Freedom of Association is being sent a list of  signatures of workers disassociating themselves from the trade union and the complaint presented to the ILO.' On  April, the five trade union delegates, supported by  people not employed by the enterprise, headed by Mr. Jos Ortiz Arcos, took over the enterprise and, using physical and verbal violence, blocked access to workers who had come to work. For about three hours the enterprise was awash in a climate of physical and mental aggression, valuable hours of production were lost, output was damaged by a sudden stoppage of the equipment, etc.; many people now feel uneasy, sensing that these acts of vandalism can recur at any moment. As a result of these acts, four workers sustained physical injuries and were provided with medical assistance in clinics; complaints have been filed concerning these injuries and the illegal takeover. Criminal proceedings have been instituted. As a result of the behaviour and arrogance displayed by the Inter-enterprise Trade Union leaders, combined with the takeover of the enterprise, during which the entrances were blocked with chains and workers and management were denied access, several of the union s members resigned from membership so that to date, on  April, less than  per cent of the workers support the union and more resignations are being sent daily.
.In its communication of  May , concerning the alleged violations of freedom of association and, more specifically, the impact on the public order of an illegal -hour stoppage called by the Single Central Trade Union of Workers (CUT) on  August , the Government states that, by decision of  August , the Governor of the Metropolitan Region authorized the CUT to hold a public demonstration consisting of six protest marches starting at  a.m. on  August , whose itinerary would cover a number of streets of Santiago. The decision stated expressly that the marchers would occupy one lane to prevent vehicular and pedestrian traffic congestion.
.However, on the day in question, according to information provided by the Chilean police force, a total of  persons were detained in the metropolitan region on the following grounds:  of them for rioting;  for grave disorderly conduct; four for grave disorderly conduct and damage to public property; four for carrying incendiary devices; two persons for injuring police officers; one for assaulting a",0,2003,Chile
123,"police officer on duty; and two for violation of section  of the Penal Code. The Committee is informed that all  of these persons have been released.
.Section  of the Penal Code provides as follows:Section . Any person who manufactures, sells or has in his or her possession skeleton keys, pick-locks or other tools known to be used for breaking and entering and does not account satisfactorily for their manufacture, sale, acquisition or possession shall be punishable with short-term imprisonment to the minimum degree.
.Approximately , persons participated in the authorized event, and incidents were registered when demonstrators attempted to block traffic, contrary to the instructions given by police, with the result that police officers were obliged to use deterrents such as water cannons and tear gas. While it is true that the right of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution, it is no less true that it is subject to the constitutional requirement that it be exercised peacefully and without the use of weapons. Hence, as these requirements were not met, the uniformed police officers had to intervene to safeguard the public order.
.Paragraph  of article  of the Political Constitution guarantees the right of assembly as follows:Constitutional rights and obligationsArticle . The Constitution guarantees to all persons:
.The right to assemble peacefully without prior permission and carrying no weapons. Meetings at squares, streets and other public places shall be ruled by general police regulations.
.The incidents described were registered in  districts of the metropolitan region.
.It is alleged that the Youth Protection Service (SENAME) drew up lists of officials who took part in the illegal -hour stoppage. The National Directorate of the Youth Protection Service has stated that the National Association of Workers (ANTRASE) did not submit any direct complaint and there are no facts to its knowledge which confirm the accusation that has been made.
.In no circumstances did the national authority of the SENAME or any other executive body of that institution order that lists be drawn up with the names of participants who responded to the call for a national strike, much less did they intervene or exert influence on employees who are members of the unions of this service to refrain from participating or agree to participate in the events held by those occupational organizations.
.As regards the acts described in the complaint, the Committee is informed that, normally, when occupational associations call any kind of industrial action, a statistical register is kept of the number of officials who will remain at their posts in order to have a precise idea of the number of staff available in their service and, if necessary, to assign additional staff to those areas which are understaffed. This is aimed at ensuring, as far as possible with the available human resources, continuity of the function assigned to this service by the law, as provided by Act No. , of  to issue general regulations governing the administration of the State.
.In this case, the only information requested from the regional directorates of the service was a report on the situation in the regional directorates and its subsidiary centres dealing directly with youth protection in regard to the response to the call for a strike, and to whether or not their institutional functions were being carried out in the normal way. This is in accordance with the powers conferred by the Constitution and the legislation on the authorities and heads of service in respect of ensuring the smooth administrative and technical operation of their institutions. This was communicated in advance verbally to each of the presidents of the occupational associations existing in the SENAME, which did not make any observation at the time concerning the procedure applied by the national directorate of the SENAME.
.It is important to point out that the SENAME is a state body in charge of protecting and promoting the rights of girls, boys and adolescents aged under  years whose rights have been infringed, and the social integration of adolescents who have committed penal offences and are serving sentences of imprisonment by court order. This work is carried out by  centres throughout the country, which operate  hours a day and  days a year, which means that it is absolutely essential for each of them to function without interruption. Hence the concern to maintain staffing levels in these centres which enable them to provide adequate care to the girls, boys and adolescents placed under their responsibility by court decision. This particular characteristic of the SENAME is understood by all of its employees and their occupational associations, who have been notified of the willingness of the service to refrain from interfering in trade union activities, while requesting them to take the necessary steps to ensure that shifts are kept in the different centres throughout the country. This concern is shared by the trade union leadership and has helped to ensure that at no time has any risk been entailed to the direct care provided to boys, girls and adolescents who use the centres under its administration
.Based on the national legislation in force and in full compliance with international Conventions and standards ratified by the Government of Chile, the SENAME has fully respected agreements concluded with trade unions and, moreover, constantly makes every effort to maintain a fluid, appropriate and open relationship with the four trade unions operating in it: AFUSE, with about , members, accounting for . per cent of the entire workforce; ANFUR, with  members, accounting for . per cent; ANTRASE, which signed the complaint to the ILO, with approximately  members, accounting for . per cent; and ARHSE, with  members, accounting for . per cent.
.Moreover, it has been customary to hold pre-strike meetings with these organizations, either with each association separately, or with all of them, in order to coordinate action and provide necessary support, to help ensure that these organizations carry out their principal objectives under section  of Act No. ,.
.It is alleged that the Minister of Education and other senior officials threatened participants in the stoppage of  August . In this respect, the Committee is informed that the authorities of the Ministry of Education do not pursue a policy of infringing the trade union rights of its officials.
.During the terms of office of the governing coalition  Concertation for democracy'  at no time have deductions been made from their remuneration or threats been made when, in the exercise of the freedoms granted them under the legal system, they have participated in demonstrations aimed at improving their rights.
.As to the dismissal of the teachers Marcela and Patricia Mallea Bustos, this is a matter which lies outside the remit of the Ministry of Education, since the employment relationships of teachers are established directly between the teachers and the education providers and are governed by the  Teachers' Statute' in the case of municipal providers, and by the Labour Code, in the case of private providers. In the event of unjustified dismissal, it is the labour courts that are competent to rule in the case of teachers and in the private sector, and for the Comptroller-General of the Republic in the case of teachers employed by educational establishments administered directly by the municipalities.
.As regards the expressions attributed to the Minister of Health, described by the complainant as  threats to public sector workers' aimed at discouraging participation in the illegal strike of  August , the Committee is informed that the sentences quoted are extracts from instructions issued by the Minister of Health, which were intended to implement the necessary measures to ensure the normal running of the country s health services in order to safeguard the provision of health care to users in the face of the call for a work stoppage by trade unions in August . This was done in strict conformity with the legal frameworks in force, and by no means constituted threats to public employees.
.A request for the use of the police forces is only made in the event of disruption of the normal functioning of health services and hospital establishments, caused by acts of coercion which might affect the care dispensed to patients and users.
.With regard to the trade unions, the Ministry of Health has acted consistently with government policy, since it has abided by a framework of full respect for the labour rights laid down in the ILO Conventions that are in force in Chile, guaranteeing free and organized participation and negotiation of the workers in this sector, one of its main objectives being to make every effort to achieve harmony between the interests and activities of the institution and those of the trade unions, with the aim of improving communications and avenues for participation in the country s health system.
.As regards the allegation that workers employed by Empresa Metro S.A. (the metropolitan underground railway) were  obliged to work -hour days'  the Regional Labour Directorate of the Metropolitan Region was consulted, and stated that it was not aware of any complaint regarding excessive daily",-1,2003,Chile
124,"hours of work allegedly performed on  August  in Empresa Metro S.A.
.The National Labour Directorate carried out a review of its entire inspection system and did not find any request for an inspection by the trade union or the workers employed by the metro.
.As regards the circumstances surrounding the illegal stoppage called for  August  by the CUT, the Committee is informed of the following: on  December , the CUT had  trade union affiliates in both the public and private sectors, with a membership of ,; in the days preceding  August  only  of the  affiliates had confirmed their support for the stoppage; the stoppage was marked by the following acts of violence:' detonation of a bomb at the base of a public electricity post in the Maip district in the metropolitan region;' detonation of an explosive device in front of the premises of the San Ramn municipal council, San Ramn district, metropolitan region;' placing of devices known as  miguelitos' (a metal device used for puncturing tyres) on a number of main arteries on the periphery of the capital and installation of  barricades to block public and private transport in the metropolitan region;' interception and illegal appropriation of a public passenger transport vehicle by a number of persons bearing firearms; they later set fire to the vehicle in the metropolitan region;' confrontation between students of the Universidad de Concepcin and uniformed police in Region VIII;' blockage of river transport on the Pedro de Valdivia river using medium-sized vessels in Region X;' slowdown of traffic on Vicua Mackenna Avenue by collective taxi drivers, who also featured prominently in several incidents involving uniformed police officers;' throwing of a Molotov cocktail into a police vehicle in the metropolitan region;' violent confrontations between police and demonstrators in Alameda Bernardo O iggins Avenue. The latter were using Molotov cocktails, stones and paint bags.
.The Ministry of the Interior considers that what happened on  August  was not a nationwide strike called by the CUT, but only partial demonstrations and marches. Absences of part of the workforce were registered in a number of colleges, health clinics and certain public services.
.As regards reform of the labour court system, the Committee is informed that in September  the Government submitted to Parliament three Bills on the subject: a Bill to amend Act No. , on the judicial recovery of social security contributions and fines; a Bill establishing new labour courts and courts for the recovery of labour and social security contributions; and a Bill establishing a new labour court procedure.
.These three Bills are currently before the Chamber of Deputies, whose Labour and Social Security Committee has examined and discussed the content of the first Bill, which, once it is approved, will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion and approval, thus completing the first stage of the constitutional legislative process, and will then be brought before the Senate for the second stage of the process. In the meantime, the Labour and Social Security Committee of the Chamber of Deputies will begin discussion of the second Bill establishing new labour courts throughout the country.
.In its communication of  June , with regard to the allegations concerning the HERPA S.A. enterprise, the Government states that, according to information from the labour directorate, on  October  a group of workers employed by the enterprise deposited a draft collective agreement in the Maipo District Labour Inspectorate for notification. On  November , the Inter-enterprise Union of Metallurgical, Communications, Energy and Allied Workers complained that the employer had not notified the other workers of the enterprise of this, as provided in section  of the Labour Code, and had illegally dismissed workers covered by trade union immunity, a situation which has been resolved, according to information provided by the Inspection Unit of the Maipo District.
.The inspection visit carried out in the Spanish multinational on  November  was aimed at verifying the existence of other collective agreements and other workers who should be informed in accordance with section  and informing the bargaining committee that the reply was considered to be pending until expiry of the time limit of  days, i.e. until  December, and that from this date onwards the bargaining committee would have a time limit of five days within which to present objections as to the legality of the employer s reply. The mediation requested by the employer was terminated on  January  without agreement being reached between the parties. On the following day, a legal strike was held with the approval of the eight workers involved. According to information provided by the office manager, on that day access to the enterprise was blocked with chains and the eight workers inside the premises did not allow the employer or the rest of the workers not involved in the strike to enter the premises. The office manager instructed the members of the bargaining committee to allow the workers to enter but they refused to do so. The legal representative of the enterprise refused to continue talks with the workers as long as they maintained this stance.
.The labour inspectorate offered mediation to both parties for the sole purpose of seeking a rapprochement to open dialogue. It was in this context that the acts that are the subject of the complaint occurred.
.As regards the unlawful dismissal of and alleged harassment against trade union delegate Nstor Carrasco, compelling him to hand in his resignation, and pressure on members to resign from the trade union, the Government states that these acts led to a commission being established under the Special Investigation Unit of the Metropolitan Region, which confirmed the truth of the allegations, as well as obstruction of the trade union s activities and harassment of both the delegate and members of the organization. This served as a basis for the complaint filed against the enterprise with the Second Court of the First Instance of San Bernardo, which ordered the reinstatement of Nstor Carrasco, which the enterprise carried out. However, subsequently, on  December , Mr. Carrasco signed a voluntary termination of employment.
.As regards the unlawful dismissal of the workers Alberto Carrasco, Marcos Rojas and Jaime Vera, who were members of the bargaining committee, the Government states that this led to a commission being set up by the Maipo District Labour Inspectorate, which obtained the reinstatement of these workers. An investigation carried out by the Special Unit of the Metropolitan Region confirmed the employer s refusal to receive the members of the bargaining committee, and to assign them work as agreed. In addition, it found that six workers had been hired before the strike began. The investigation confirmed that the employer had refused to see the trade union leaders, saying that he would only talk to the trade union delegate. As regards non-payment of remuneration, it found that, on the contrary, the employer had in fact paid the remuneration through a deposit into an electronic checking account. As regards the hiring of strike-breakers, it was confirmed that an external enterprise had been contracted to increase the number of security guards in the enterprise. The alleged threats of dismissal were not confirmed.
.In its communication dated  July , the Government states that, according to the Regional Labour Directorate of Region VI, in which the El Teniente copper mine owned by CODELCO enterprise is located, as of June  no complaint had been received from the workers or the trade union concerning the allegations made in the communication of January . On  December  the Inter-enterprise Union of Employees of Subcontractors of CODELCO Chile, El Teniente Division (SITECO), presented draft collective agreements intended for different subcontractors to the Rancagua Provincial Labour Inspectorate, together with lists of the workers involved in negotiations, but without the required signatures of each worker. These requests were based on ILO Conventions Nos.  and , and not on section  of the Labour Code. Hence this collective bargaining process was not regulated by that Code.
.The draft collective agreements allowed each employer a time limit up to  December to reply, indicating that once the time limit had expired and no reply had been received, the trade union could declare a strike. It also mentioned a proposal for a meeting to be held on  December  to lay down a procedure for the bargaining process; none of the  enterprises invited attended that meeting. As a result, the workers undertook protest actions beginning on  December. According to information given by the SITECO leader, Danilo Jorquera, the most serious of these was a sit-down strike both in the Caletones foundry and inside the mine. In Caletones, the workers signed an agreement to initiate a collective bargaining in each enterprise, but this did not take place. Inside the mine, uniformed police evicted the workers and detained  of them, who were released after taking down their addresses. The police authorities stated that at no time were firearms used,",-1,2003,Chile
125,"only deterrents such as chemicals and water. The health authorities reported that only two workers had been injured and that the others were declared fit on the same day after having undergone a medical examination.
.The trade union leadership dropped out of the collective bargaining process; the principal enterprise, CODELCO Chile, El Teniente division, informed its subcontractors that  workers could not work in the mines and withdrew their passes.
.Faced with this situation, the subcontractors dismissed these workers, except for a few trade union delegates covered by trade union immunity. The trade union, through Mr. Luis Salazar, held talks with the principal enterprise with a view to seeking a solution, with the result that CODELCO rescinded its decision to exclude  workers from working in its enterprises. No complaint has been filed with the relevant courts in this respect. In recent weeks, the trade union leadership resumed dialogue with the CODELCO Chile enterprise through the Regional Ministerial Secretary for Labour and Social Security, but the outcome is not yet known.
.The Committee notes the allegations made by the complainants, referring to: () anti-union practices in the PLASTYVERG conglomerate, including dismissals of trade union delegates and members, pressure on members to resign from trade union membership, interference by several enterprises to sideline the trade union and bargain with workers' delegates appointed by the employer; () violent repression of the national strike held on  August , despite its peaceful nature; detention of trade unionists, threats and intimidation against workers participating in the strike, use of armoured cars, water cannons and tear gas ' including against CUT headquarters ' ill-treatment, closure of streets to which access was authorized to demonstrators, assault on the general secretary of the CUT, use of rubber bullets, injury of workers, torture of a detainee, drawing up of lists of strike participants in different institutions and dismissal of a teachers' union leader and her sister; and () violations of trade union rights by the CODELCO state enterprise and the HERPA S.A., Vias Tarapac y Santa Helena enterprise.PLASTYVERG conglomerate
.As regards the allegations concerning the PLASTYVERG conglomerate, the Committee notes the information given by the Government, in particular its statement that the labour directorate carried out an investigation which confirmed that pressure had been brought to bear by the enterprises in regard to the election of staff delegates, and that trade union members had been pressured to resign from membership during the collective bargaining process, as a result of which a complaint was filed with the courts for anti-union practices; the judicial authority upheld part of the complaint relating to pressure on union members to withdraw from union membership, ordered that this conduct cease and imposed a fine of  monthly tax units on the enterprise; it did not uphold the complaint referring to employer interference in the election of the staff delegate; in this respect, a second complaint has been filed by the trade union and is currently under investigation; mediation has been offered and this issue will be dealt with in the near future. The Committee notes the statements made by the enterprises concerned in which they reject the allegations of violation of trade union rights and report that criminal proceedings have been instituted against a number of trade union delegates; the enterprises have sent documentation on the termination of the employment relationship of trade unionists Jos Saavedra, Antonio Labarca, Pablo Villavicencio, Daniel Antonio Duarte Arce and Luis Osvaldo Martnez Duarte, who waived any legal claims; they have also sent a list of  workers disassociating themselves from the present complaint before the Committee. In these circumstances, the Committee deplores the anti-union pressure by the enterprise that was confirmed by the judicial authority. Nonetheless, before formulating definitive conclusions on these allegations, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the reports concerning the administrative investigations carried out and all of the judicial decisions which have been handed down.Violent acts
.As regards the allegations concerning the violent repression of the national strike on  August  (assaults on physical integrity, detentions, threats and intimidation, use of tear gas and water cannons, dismissal of two trade unionists, torture of a detainee, etc.), the Committee notes that the Government categorically denies the peaceful nature of the strike, referring to  criminal offences including possession of explosive devices, placement of tyre-puncturing devices, illegal appropriation of a passenger vehicle which was subsequently set on fire, violent confrontations, disruption of traffic, etc.; the Government also denies that lists of strikers had been drawn up and that the authorities had issued threats;  persons had been detained and subsequently released.
.The Committee is bound to take note of the obvious contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply, deplores any acts of violence which occurred during the general strike, and requests the Government to send any judicial decisions handed down in relation to the criminal proceedings referred to by the complainants or any of the other violent acts mentioned by the Government.HERPA S.A., Vias Tarapac ySanta Helena enterprises
.As regards the allegations concerning the HERPA S.A., Vias Tarapac y Santa Helena enterprises, the Committee notes the Government s reply to the effect that on  October  a group of workers employed by the enterprise deposited a draft collective agreement in the Maipo District Labour Inspectorate for notification. On  November  the SME complained that the employer had not notified the other workers of the enterprise of this, as provided in section  of the Labour Code, and also complained that workers covered by trade union immunity had illegally been dismissed, a situation which has been resolved, according to information provided by the Inspection Unit of the Maipo District Labour Inspectorate. On  January  arbitration requested by the employer was terminated without agreement being reached between the parties. On the next day, the legal strike approved by the eight workers involved was carried out. On that day access to the enterprise was blocked with chains and the eight workers on the premises did not allow the employer or the rest of the workers not involved in the strike to enter the premises. Although the office manager instructed the members of the bargaining committee to allow the workers to enter, they refused to do so. The legal representative of the enterprise refused to continue talks as long as the workers maintained this stance. The labour inspectorate offered mediation to both parties. The acts reported occurred in this context.
.As regards the allegations of unlawful dismissal of and harassment against trade union delegate Nstor Carrasco, compelling him to hand in his resignation, and pressure on members to resign from the trade union, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the inspection commission confirmed that this had in fact taken place, as well as obstruction of the trade union s activities and harassment of both the delegate and members of the organization. This served as a basis for a complaint filed against the enterprise with the Second Court of the First Instance of San Bernardo, which ordered the reinstatement of Nstor Carrasco, which the enterprise carried out. However, subsequently, on  December , Mr. Carrasco signed a voluntary termination of employment.
.As regards allegations of the unlawful dismissal of the workers Alberto Carrasco, Marcos Rojas and Jaime Vera, who were members of the bargaining committee, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these workers were reinstated. An investigation carried out by the Special Unit of the Metropolitan Region confirmed the employer s refusal to receive the members of the bargaining committee, and to assign them work as agreed. In addition, it found that six workers had been hired before the strike began and that the employer had refused to see the trade union leaders, saying that he would only talk to the trade union delegate (elect); on the first point (the hiring of strike-breakers), it was confirmed that an external enterprise had been contracted but only in order to increase the number of security guards in the enterprise.
.In these circumstances, the Committee expresses its concern at the anti-union acts perpetrated in the enterprises HERPA S.A., Vias Tarapac y Santa Helena confirmed by the authorities, and observes that the latter s intervention allowed the reinstatement of trade unionists Nstor Carrasco, Alberto Carrasco, Marcos Rojas and Jaime Vera. The Committee requests the Government: () to indicate whether the latest administrative investigation in these enterprises gave rise to judicial proceedings and, if so, to inform it of their outcome; and () to provide information on the allegations relating to the detention of workers and violent police intervention to evict workers, despite the absence of a court order.CODELCO state enterprise
.As regards the allegations concerning the CODELCO state enterprise (refusal to bargain collectively with the SME trade union, assault on three trade union leaders in the public thoroughfare, denial of access by trade union leaders to members in the mines, illegal violent intervention by police against strikers, with the result that  were detained and released on the same day,  dismissals",-1,2003,Chile
126,"of workers included on blacklists and injuries sustained by  workers ' one of whom was hit by  shots) the Committee notes the information provided by the Government to the effect that during the strike  workers were detained and later released after verifying their addresses, that the police did not use firearms, but chemicals and water and only two workers sustained injuries and that the rest were declared fit on the same day. The Committee notes further that the enterprise informed its subcontractors that the dismissed workers could not work in the mines and withdrew their passes from  workers, but that this ban was subsequently lifted. Lastly, the Committee notes that no complaint has been filed with the judicial authority and that the trade union leadership has resumed dialogue with the enterprise, through the administrative labour authority.
.The Committee deplores the acts of violence which occurred, as well as the fact that the Government s reply does not refer to all the allegations presented (refusal to negotiate, access by trade union leaders to members, use of blacklists, etc.). The Committee recalls that  workers should enjoy the right to peaceful demonstration to defend their occupational interests' and that  trade unions should respect legal provisions which are intended to ensure the maintenance of public order; the public authorities should, for their part, refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of trade unions to organize the holding and proceedings of their meetings in full freedom' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to carry out a full and impartial investigation, including into the injuries sustained by workers, and to inform it of its outcome, as well as the results of the dialogue that has been resumed between the trade union leadership and the enterprise.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegations concerning the PLASTYVERG group of enterprises, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the reports concerning the administrative investigations carried out and all of the judicial decisions which have been handed down.(b) As regards the allegations concerning the violent repression of the national strike on  August , the Committee is bound to take note of the obvious contradiction between the allegations and the Government s reply, deplores any acts of violence which occurred during the general strike, and requests the Government to send any judicial decisions handed down in relation to the criminal proceedings referred to by the complainants or any other of the acts of violence mentioned by the Government.(c) As regards the allegations concerning the HERPA S.A., Vias Tarapac y Santa Helena enterprises, the Committee requests the Government: () to indicate whether the latest administrative investigation in these enterprises gave rise to judicial proceedings and, if so, to inform it of their outcome; and () to provide information on the allegations concerning the detention of workers and violent police intervention to evict workers, despite the absence of the court order.(d) As regards the allegations concerning the CODELCO state enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to carry out a full and impartial investigation, including into the injuries sustained by workers, and to inform it of its outcome, as well as the results of the dialogue that has been resumed between the trade union leadership and the enterprise.",-1,2003,Chile
127,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Teachers' Association of Chile dated  October . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the Teachers' Association of Chile (CPCAG), an affiliate of the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT), explains that since , with the advent of democratic government in Chile, a process has begun of restoring the rights lost by Chilean workers, and teachers in particular, during the military dictatorship. Over the years, the complainant organization, like other public sector organizations, has participated in negotiations on wages, among other issues. These negotiations took place with the public authority, represented in this case by the Ministry of Education, according to de facto procedures which created a situation of uncertainty for the teachers since the procedures, time limits and other aspects of negotiation had been fixed unilaterally and arbitrarily by the authority.
.The complainant organization alleges that on  April  it submitted to the Minister of Education a list of teachers' demands relating to professional, pedagogical and wage issues, which launched the  bargaining round and was signed by the National Executive Committee and all the regional presidents. While it is true that the authority agreed to bargain with the organization and a number of bipartite working committees were set up to deal with the items on the list of demands, there had been no formal reply to date on the points on the list of demands, and in particular on the wage increase requested by the teachers' association.
.The complainant organization states that it is clear from this attitude that the authority was not genuinely willing to negotiate and conclude an agreement on wages, among other issues; the authority confined itself to publicly discrediting the list of demands without taking the trouble to present a formal and serious counter-proposal indicating specific amounts and distribution formulas of the promised wage increase.
.The complainant organization states further that this refusal to negotiate, which constitutes an abuse of power by the authority, led to two strikes being held, in accordance with mandates given by the National Assembly. The first took place on  September  and, since there was no response by the authority despite the strike, a second strike was held on  and  October of the same year. These strikes were solely and exclusively motivated by economic and occupational interests, outside of any political or other considerations, and was therefore protected under the institutional framework provided by the International Labour Organization.
.The complainant organization states that public education is currently administered by the municipalities, which may manage it either directly or through municipal corporations; however, it is still  per cent publicly financed, either through central state subsidies or through contributions by the municipalities. The latter share does not, as a rule, cover more than  per cent of the system.
.The complainant organization alleges further that an attempt is being made to infringe the right to strike: both the central authority and the decentralized administrative bodies have threatened the teachers who responded to the call for a strike by their national organization with dismissals, disciplinary proceedings, deductions from remuneration for hours not worked and other punitive measures inappropriate for a democratic State to apply to people whose only offence was to fight for their fair and legitimate demands. The application of any punitive measure such as those described above against the teachers who adhered to the strikes called by their organization constitutes an anti-union practice which should be void by operation of law, in particular given that after Chile s ratification of ILO Conventions Nos. ,  and , these Conventions were promulgated as legislation of the Republic and hence wage and other negotiations between the CPCAG and the authority now take place within an institutional framework derived from the fact that these Conventions are now embodied in the legislation of the Republic and even have constitutional rank according to article , paragraph , of the Political Constitution.
.While it is true that the abovementioned Conventions do not contain explicit provisions concerning the exercise of the right to strike, the latter has been recognized repeatedly through the case law of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.Accordingly, faced with the Government s refusal to apply Conventions Nos. ,  and , the complainant organization legitimately exercised the right to hold a legal strike, on the grounds of which it has been threatened with severe sanctions which are entirely inappropriate, given that the exercise of a right can in no case be a punishable act, either directly or indirectly, either through disciplinary proceedings or dismissals or through deductions from pay for hours not worked. It is paradoxical, to say the least, that the threats of sanctions, i.e. acts which are contrary to law, emanate from the State itself, whose bodies hold a constitutional mandate to respect and promote compliance with the law, especially those provisions embodying international treaties ratified by Chile and which are in force pursuant to article () of the Political Constitution mentioned above.
.Furthermore, it is not a valid excuse to refuse to apply the laws arising out of ILO Conventions on the grounds that no regulations have been enacted governing their application, since this condition is not stipulated in any legal text, and the public authorities cannot, by virtue of the principle of legality benefiting a State based on the rule of law, arrogate to itself powers in addition to those granted to it by the Constitution and the law. In line with this argument, any international treaty ratified by Chile could remain a dead letter forever until a law regulating it is enacted ' an assertion which is repugnant and contrary to the moral and juridical conscience of all those who uphold the need for the full application of an international and globalized public order in labour law which essentially promotes respect for and the furtherance of economic, social and cultural rights of persons and their associations.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that in Chile, no teacher, in the exercise of his or her occupation, has as an employer counterpart the central Government or the Minister of Education. Employment contracts are concluded ' and hence the economic and social benefits contained in them are agreed ' between each teacher and his or her private employer or private subsidized employer, or the municipality employing them, without intervention by the central Government.
.Concerning the teachers employed in the private sector, whether privately financed or subsidized, they are covered by the Labour Code (a general law) governing the procedure of collective bargaining, which they may engage in and which they do engage in vis--vis their employers, without restrictions other than the requirement of representativeness.
.As for teachers employed in the municipal sector, who may be considered as public officials in the broad sense of the term, their conditions of employment and remuneration are freely determined between the parties to the employment relationship (teacher and municipality) in each particular case, within the framework of the  Statute on Education Professionals'  which is a regulation protecting the workers in this sector. Notwithstanding the above, the abovementioned statute does not provide for machinery for negotiation between these officials of the municipal public sector and the Government, or between the latter and the Teachers' Association of Chile, which is an occupational association for professional representation rather than a trade union representing its members' interests ' a legal situation which is fully in conformity with international standards given that, unlike the case of Convention No. , whose scope includes all workers, it is possible under Convention No.  to exclude a certain category of workers from the exercise of this right.
.Article  of Convention No.  provides that it  does not deal with the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the State ...'  without prejudice to this, the Government of Chile ' as the complainant organization points out in its complaint ' since the restoration of democracy and even before ratifying Convention No.  has engaged in negotiations with that occupational organization for the purpose of proposing to the National Congress the establishment or modification of the national legal and financial frameworks having a bearing on the contracts concluded between municipal employers and the teachers employed by them. The provisions affecting the conditions of employment contained in contracts concluded on a decentralized basis are mainly in the form of national laws drafted and approved, in accordance with the Constitution, with the participation of the National Congress and the Executive Branch.
.The President of the Republic is vested with exclusive power to propose legislation involving or affecting public expenditure, which is crucial in a system in",0,2003,Chile
128,"which most of the resources used by the municipalities to finance education come from subsidies or transfers from the national budget. These proposals have been agreed to and implemented in the past up to the present day, and this constitutes a bargaining procedure which has become established practice, in keeping with the principle of good faith, in accordance with which they have been agreed upon and implemented, as noted by the Committee on Freedom of Association when it recognized this form of bargaining in Case No.  of , in which the complainant organization submitted a complaint concerning the bargaining procedure, recognizing its existence.
.Accordingly, and despite the constraints of the situation and the absence of an explicit regulatory framework, the Government has negotiated the terms and conditions for the sector and complied with the agreements concluded, and continues to do so up to the present day.
.Concerning the alleged refusal by the authority to negotiate with the complainant organization, the Government points out that the complaint itself submitted by the Teachers' Association of Chile, states the following:  ...while it is true that the authority  agreed to bargain' with the organization and a number of bipartite working committees were set up to deal with the items on the list of demands  ? thus the complaint itself disproves the complainants' assertions, and hence the content of the complaint appears to be reduced to the timing of negotiations, specifically the date on which they were to be concluded, since what the complaint maintains is that the complainants' list of demands was negotiated but did not culminate in an agreement.
.The Government adds that the time limits and procedures of self-regulated negotiations cannot be fixed unilaterally by one of the parties, as the complainant organization appears to claim, but must be established by agreement between them, as it is essential to a good faith interpretation to take customary practice into account, as well as the context in which the negotiations take place.
.It is common knowledge in Chile that since  the Government has periodically negotiated the legal and financial frameworks governing terms and conditions of employment of municipal teachers, which are established between the latter and their respective employers, and these negotiations are intrinsically linked to the discussion of the general budget Act and the evaluation by the financial authority of the possibilities of increasing wage benefits of public employees; pursuant to legal provisions derived from constitutional principles, this is done in the last months of each year in our country.
.The Government points out that the Committee on Freedom of Association, endorsing the point of view expressed by the Committee of Experts, maintained that  while the principle of autonomy of the parties to collective bargaining is valid as regards public servants covered by Convention No. , the special characteristics of the public service described above requires some flexibility in its application' (Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, th edition, para. ) and that  collective bargaining in the public sector calls for verification of the available resources' (ibid., para. ).
.It follows from the above that the Government did not refuse to negotiate, but did so according to the timing and procedures established by customary practice with the complainant organization, in good faith, and reached an agreement with that organization which, among other points, provides for the following socio-economic benefits for teaching staff:- an increase in teachers' wages for the years ,  and , which includes the general wage adjustment for the public sector equivalent to  per cent for ; . per cent for ; and . per cent for , in addition to an increase for the subsidized private sector;- a cash bonus for teachers for  and ;- an improvement in labour standards for teaching staff;- an amendment in the regulations on authorization and qualification to engage in the teaching profession;- implementation of the academic work in the municipal sector;- improvement in the regulations on administrative disciplinary proceedings for teachers under municipal administration;- timing of staff meetings in educational establishments;- provisions on occupational diseases;- benefits for municipal sector teachers who take retirement;- special assistance for teachers of establishments in socially vulnerable conditions;- cash bonus for teachers in charge of rural schools;- support for the compulsory creation of teacher training courses;- change in the further training allowance;- variable individual performance allowance, linked to the performance evaluation system for teaching staff;- improvement in the designation of responsibility for management positions and technical pedagogical posts.
.There has thus been no refusal to negotiate; on the contrary, this bargaining round has been one of the most wide-ranging and beneficial for teachers in recent years, which obviously required more extensive and detailed bargaining at a faster pace than usual and a conclusion appropriate to bargaining on this scale.
.Another aspect of the complaint relates to the alleged existence of anti-union practices, both by the central authority and by the decentralized administrative bodies, allegedly consisting of  threats to teachers who responded to the call for a strike by their national organization with dismissals, disciplinary proceedings, deductions from remuneration for hours not worked and other punitive measures'  In this respect, the Government points out that no teacher, in the exercise of his or her occupation, has as a counterpart the central Government or the Minister of Education. Employment contracts are concluded between each teacher and their private employer or the municipality which employs them, without intervention by the central Government, and hence the Government against which this complaint is being presented lacks any possibility or power to carry out any of the activities described in the complaint.
.No complaints have been filed with the competent bodies relating to specific cases or situations reflecting such practices, neither is there any reference to them in the complaint itself, which merely refers in general terms to  threats' without citing specific cases. Without prejudice to the above, pursuant to the doctrine of the Committee on Freedom of Association itself,  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see th Report, Case No. , para. , th Report, Case No. , para. , and Digest, para. ].
.As regards the allegation that an attempt is being made to infringe the right to strike despite the Conventions ratified by Chile, the Government states that the legal system in Chile, through its Constitution, guarantees  the right to associate without prior authorization' (article , paragraph , of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile) and also raises to constitutional rank  the right to affiliation to unions in the cases and in the manner prescribed by law' (article , paragraph , of the Political Constitution). In addition, section  of the Labour Code recognizes that  workers in the private sector and state enterprises, irrespective of their legal nature' have the right to form  trade union organizations of their own choosing'  The same right is recognized, although in different terms, for workers engaged in the administration of the State, in section  of Act No. , on public servants' associations, which recognizes that workers engaged in the administration of the State, including the municipalities, have  the right to form public servants' associations of their own choosing'  Employers on their side may form organizations  for the purpose of promoting the rationalization, development and protection of the activities they have in common on the basis of their occupation, trade or branch of production or services'  availing themselves of the provisions contained in Legislative Decree No. , of .
.The rights enshrined in Conventions Nos.  and , as well as the right to strike, are likewise guaranteed both de jure and de facto. Although no ILO Convention or Recommendation regulates the right to strike, except Paragraph  of the Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration Recommendation,  (No. ), which provides that none of its provisions  may be interpreted as limiting, in any way whatsoever, the right to strike'  the Government of Chile is clear about its incorporation in instruments such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights () and the International American Charter of Social Guarantees (), and hence understands that the right to strike, as pointed out by the Committee on Freedom of Association, is  an intrinsic corollary of the right of association protected by Convention No. ' and therefore cannot be separated from the body of trade union rights, and hence is considered to be a fundamental right of workers and their organizations in that it constitutes a means of defending their economic interests. The Government refers to the principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association. In the case at issue, the Government points out that it has not carried out any act involving infringement of the exercise of the right to strike, although it is convinced that the strikes were not legitimate, since they were held without the possibility of safeguarding",0,2003,Chile
129,"minimum services and to the clear detriment of the most socially vulnerable segments of the population, i.e. those attending municipal education, whose right to education was infringed in a procedure which was entirely unnecessary, given the time and the context in which it was held.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization has alleged violations of teachers' right to bargain collectively and to strike. Specifically, it alleged that after a list of teachers' demands was presented to the Minister of Education, the  bargaining round was initiated, and the authority had agreed to negotiate, setting up a number of bipartite committees, and that at the time the complaint was submitted (October ) the competent authority had not made a formal reply to the items on the list of demands, an attitude which, in the view of the complainant organization, demonstrates that the authority was not genuinely willing to negotiate and conclude an agreement on wages, among other issues, and has not taken the trouble to submit a formal and serious counter-proposal. The complainant organization adds that this refusal to negotiate led it to call a strike on  September , and a second strike on  and  October of the same year.
.The Committee notes that the Government points out that despite the lack of an explicit regulatory framework, since  it has negotiated the terms and conditions of teaching personnel and complied with the agreements concluded, but that in the case at issue, in accordance with customary practice and good faith, the timing and procedures cannot be unilaterally established by one of the parties, especially given that the legal and financial frameworks governing the terms and conditions of employment of municipal teachers are linked to the discussion of the general budget Act and evaluations by the financial authority. Lastly, the Committee notes with interest that the Government reached an agreement with the complainant organization which includes, among other points, increases in teachers' remuneration for the years ,  and , which shows that the Government did not refuse to negotiate, but that it did so according to the timing and procedures established through practice with the complainant organization, in good faith.
.As regards the alleged threats by the central authority and the decentralized administrative bodies (dismissals, disciplinary proceedings, deductions of remuneration for hours not worked and other punitive measures against the workers who responded to the call for a strike by the complainant organization), the Committee notes that the Government: () denies that it has committed any act which involves infringing the right to strike; () recalls the principles of the Committee to the effect that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection; () emphasizes that the complainant organization has not cited any specific act which would have infringed the right to strike, neither have any complaints been filed; and () points out that in the case at issue the strikes were held without the possibility of safeguarding minimum services. In these circumstances, given that the collective dispute which gave rise to this case ended with the conclusion of a collective agreement and that the complainant organization has not provided details concerning the alleged threats, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2003,Chile
130,".At its meeting in June , the Committee requested the Government to communicate the ruling handed down on the dismissal of the  workers at Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A., against which a complaint had been lodged with the Freedom of Association Office of the Labour Directorate [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states that the Labour Court of Santiago ruled in favour of the complainant on  October  and that the court sentenced the company to pay costs and a fine of  monthly tax units; subsequently, an appeal was lodged against this ruling by the company, and it is still under examination.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to inform it of the decision handed down in respect of the appeal lodged by the company.
.At its meeting in June , the Committee made the following recommendations on questions that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) Regarding the failure to deduct from wages of non-unionized employees sums corresponding to the advantages derived from the collective agreements of  and , the Committee points out to the trade union of the Empresa Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A. that it rests with the union to lodge an official complaint with the labour courts for payment of said deductions, if it so desires; the Committee also calls upon the Government to clarify the discrepancies between its own statements regarding deductions and the enterprise s communication on this subject, and to send it a copy of the decision handed down by the Labour Inspectorate to the effect that the enterprise has been fined, which the enterprise denies.(b) Regarding the alleged dismissal of  workers of Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A. that had been brought before the Freedom of Association Office of the Labour Directorate, the Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken by the said Office.(c) Regarding the alleged dismissal of all the workers of Andonaegui S.A., including the union officials, after the conclusion of the collective bargaining process, the Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of the decision handed down by the judicial authority.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states with regard to the company Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A. that the Labour Inspectorate confirmed a contravention of section  of the Labour Code and the company was fined the equivalent of  monthly units of taxation for failing to deduct trade union dues from wages, failing to deduct amounts equivalent to  per cent of those dues, and failing to hand over those sums to the union. As regards the dismissal of  workers, the company s anti-union conduct was confirmed. Subsequently, through the offices of the Unit for the Defence of Freedom of Association, a complaint was made to the labour courts and was examined by the Eighth Labour Court of First Instance. As regards any judicial proceedings initiated by the trade union to challenge a decision of the Labour Directorate, the Government states that the workers' trade union at the company has not initiated any such proceedings in the labour courts, as the decision in question is considered to be favourable to them.
.As regards the company Adonaegui S.A., the Government states that in the case examined by the Santiago First Labour Court of First Instance, a ruling handed down on  November  imposed a fine equivalent to one monthly unit of taxation and ordered the reinstatement of the union officials in their normal posts, and cautioned the legal representative.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's information, and notes with interest that the administrative and judicial authorities have imposed penalties for the anti-union conduct of the companies Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A. and Adonaegui S.A. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the ruling handed down on the dismissal of the  workers at the company Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A.
.The National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of the Food, Tourism, Trade and Services Industry (COTIACH) presented its complaint in a communication dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of the Food, Tourism, Trade and Services Industry (COTIACH) alleges that, by Ordinary Act No. , the National Labour Directorate fined Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A. for failure to pay over to the enterprise s works' union the deductions that it was supposed to make from the wages of non-unionized workers in the year  (corresponding to advantages deriving from the collective agreement of ), and informed the union that it should apply to the courts for payment of the said deductions. The complainant adds that the enterprise has likewise failed to make similar deductions in respect of the new collective agreement concluded in .
.The complainant further alleges that, since the collective bargaining process that ended with the signing on  December  of a collective agreement covering  workers, a total of  workers affiliated to the union have been dismissed because of ""pressing needs of the enterprise"" (section  of the Labour Code) and that these workers were immediately replaced by part-time workers employed under individual contracts, as provided for under sections bis(a), bis(b), bis(c) and bis(d) of the Labour Code. Moreover, in November and December of  and , in a bid to wreck the trade union organization, the enterprise obliged the part-time workers to work full time, thereby inflicting damages both in financial terms and in terms of labour rights on the workers affiliated to the trade union and on those employed under part-time contracts. In disregard of the provisions of the  collective agreement, the enterprise threatened the workers with dismissal if they did not sign an annex to their individual contracts, modifying the hours of work and treating Saturdays and Sundays as normal working days, thus putting an end to the bonus that had been negotiated in the collective agreement currently in force (eighth clause, letter (h)). The complainant adds that on  November  the Labour Directorate was asked to issue a legal ruling on this matter and that on  May  the Directorate ruled (ORD. ) that the enterprises had acted within the law.
.Regarding Hoteles Carrera-Hotel Araucano de Concepcin, COTIACH alleges that since about  that enterprise has systematically resorted to practices that have resulted in the trade union s membership declining from  to a mere  workers.
.The complainant adds that on  April  Mr. Manuel Castillo was dismissed because of ""pressing needs of the enterprise"" (section  of the Labour Code) even though he enjoyed trade union immunity as National Director of COTIACH; he was reinstated in his job on  April . In July and August  the enterprise began to harass workers by unilaterally changing their rest days, obliging them to work night shifts and adding new functions to their jobs that were not provided for under their individual contracts. In December  the enterprises applied to the First Labour Tribunal of Concepcin to waive the immunity of trade union official Miguel Arroyo on the grounds that he left the enterprise without prior permission. On  February  the Tribunal ruled in favour of the union official.
.From April to September  the enterprise once again started taking unilateral decisions, obliging workers to change their rest days and disregarding the terms of individual contracts relating to daily hours of work and functions. The same year the enterprise started recruiting workers on a piece-work basis; this measure, which was aimed specifically at unionized workers, resulted in the dismissal of workers with long-term contracts.
.During  the trade union repeatedly called for financial inspections, which had led in the past to the enterprise being fined. The situation of the trade union suffered from the deliberate attempts of the enterprise to reduce the organization s strength, with the complicity of the regional labour authority which refused to carry out financial inspections in response to complaints lodged by the trade union, despite the fact that the enterprise had previously been inspected and fined for such illegal activities and had not changed its conduct.
.As from  the enterprise recruited trainees to replace union members that had been dismissed; this, together with the recruitment of piece-workers, has completely undermined the trade union organization.
.The complainant organization draws attention to the National Labour Directorate s report No. / of  October  in which it concluded that an employer can have on its premises an unlimited number of trainees without running foul of the law. Furthermore, the enterprise has infringed the principle of freedom of association by systematically exerting pressure on new workers not to join the trade union and on workers already with the organization to leave the union; for this it has employed a variety of",-1,2003,Chile
131,"methods, from the promise of wage increases to the offer of fictitious jobs within the enterprise.
.As regards Multivending Ltda., COTIACH states that early in  the enterprise entered into collective bargaining with more than  members of the trade union but that because of the constant pressure and harassment by the employer there were only three members of the organization left at the beginning of the current year. When the organization applied to the National Labour Directorate to appeal against these anti-union practices, it declared in its ordinary ruling No.  of  June  that its investigations had not brought to light any anti-union practices.
.Finally, with regard to Andonaegui S.A., a works' union was set up in the enterprise during the first half of . After the conclusion of the collective bargaining process, the enterprise started harassing the workers (all of them women) to make them leave the company; the pressure tactics used ranged from cutting off the hot water in the showers to refusing to offer the workers even minimum working conditions. The enterprise dismissed all the workers, including the union officials, without any compensation whatsoever, and it was only this that induced the labour authority to refer the matter to the labour tribunals in accordance with the labour legislation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Regarding the failure to deduct from wages of non-unionized employees sums corresponding to the advantages derived from the collective agreements of  and , the Committee points out to the trade union of the Empresa Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A. that it rests with the union to lodge an official complaint with the labour courts for payment of said deductions, if it so desires; the Committee also calls upon the Government to clarify the discrepancies between its own statements regarding deductions and the enterprise s communication on this subject, and to send it a copy of the decision handed down by the Labour Inspectorate to the effect that the enterprise has been fined, which the enterprise denies.(b) Regarding the alleged dismissal of  workers of Distribuidora de Industrias Nacionales S.A. that had been brought before the Freedom of Association Office of the Labour Directorate, the Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of any decision taken by the said Office.(c) Regarding the alleged dismissal of all the workers of Andonaegui S.A., including the union officials, after the conclusion of the collective bargaining process, the Committee calls on the Government to keep it informed of the decision handed down by the judicial authority.",2,2003,Chile
132,".The complaint is set out in a communication dated  May  from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the World Federation of Trade Unions alleges anti-union practices by the Enterprise  Via Tarapac'  It states that in , the workers formed a trade union in response to various violations of workers' rights and labour law. In subsequent months and in , the company dismissed many of the union s members and applied pressure or threats against others to force them to withdraw from the union, while conceding superior benefits to non-unionized workers in the process of collective bargaining. The WFTU recalls that in , the workers had tried to set up a trade union at the enterprise, but after it had been established the company dismissed  workers involved in organizing it.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that on  June , the Trade Union of Workers at the Enterprise  Via Tarapac' lodged a complaint in connection with anti-union dismissals and other anti-union practices mentioned by the complainant. The Government states, however, that from the establishment of the trade union in July  (with  members) until the date on which the complaint was lodged, the number of members increased to . The Government adds that the labour administrative authority visited the company and was told by union leaders and the company s legal representative that an agreement was about to be signed. The union leaders said that, this being the case, they would not press the complaint. The trade union sent a letter to the Ministry of Labour on  January , stating that the problems which had given rise to the complaint to the administrative authority had been resolved and that relations between the parties were now normal. The Government attaches a copy of that letter to its reply and states in conclusion that the present case has been resolved.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government and a letter dated  January  signed by the Trade Union of Workers at the Enterprise  Via Tarapac'  the problems which had given rise to a complaint regarding dismissals and anti-union practices have been resolved and normal relations have been established between the parties. The Committee also notes that the trade union did not press its complaint regarding these matters before the labour administrative authority.

133,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Amalgamated Workers' Union of Chile (CUT) dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the Amalgamated Workers' Union of Chile (CUT) explains that a group of clerical workers at the land registry office in Santiago de Chile established a trade union, and that on  September  the Supreme Court handed down Ruling No.  providing that  clerical officials working at a land registry office may not establish trade unions as the regime governing them, which is established in the Courts Organization Code, is incompatible with the regime that governs unionized workers'  (The complainant organization adds a copy of this judicial declaration by the Supreme Court from which it emerges that the land registrars (employers) informed the Court about the establishment of a trade union and about the request to deduct union dues, and asked for directions in this respect.)
.The complainant organization indicates that the Supreme Court of Justice is blatantly ignoring written legislation with this ruling. Legislation clearly establishes that workers who provide services in land registry offices shall be subject to all the rights and duties contained in the Labour Code. Of these, the right to freedom of association is one of the fundamental rights. The formulation of article  of the Labour Code is perfectly clear in its differentiation of groups of employees and workers. There are no stipulations or contradictions that could give rise to a different interpretation. The reasoning of the Supreme Court whereby ' .. land registrars belong to the secondary scale of the judicial power ...' and ' .. a special regime governs the work they perform as public officials authenticating documents ...'  has nothing to do with the right of clerical workers at land registry offices to establish trade unions.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that as soon as the judicial declaration by the Supreme Court was known (issued in the framework of an administrative consultation), it ruled that  clerical officials working at a land registry office may not establish trade unions as the regime governing them (established in the Courts Organization Code) is incompatible with the regime that governs unionized workers'  the Legal Department of the Labour Directorate then prepared a document, dated  October , which determined the legal status of staff working at notaries' offices, registries and record offices with respect to their right to establish trade unions and bargain collectively. The Labour Directorate also repeatedly described the offices of notaries and registrars as enterprises for the purposes of the rights and obligations of their workers. In order to dispel any doubt in this respect, Act No.  of  October  added a final clause to article  of the Labour Code, which categorically establishes that  workers who provide services at notaries' offices, registries and record offices shall be governed by the provisions of this Code' 
.It should be borne in mind that the Santiago land registry did not object, at the time, to the establishment of the trade unions, but when they asked it to deduct the union dues and deposit them in the current bank accounts of the respective organizations it refused to do so. Given this refusal by the employer, on  April  the executive committee of the Santiago Land Registry Workers' Union lodged a complaint with the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Santiago.
.The Government states that this complaint was examined by the Labour Services investigator, who went to the premises of the enterprise charged and found that, in effect, the employer had refused to deduct the union dues in March and April  from all the unionized workers. In response to this infringement, an administrative fine was levied on  May , corresponding to  monthly tax units. In June , the administrative authority fined the employer the same amount again on the same grounds. The Government states that the Ministry of Labour is seeking to reconcile the parties with regard to the deduction of union dues.
.Lastly, the Government notes that the Trade Union of the Santiago Land Registry, established on  March , and Trade Union No.  of the Santiago Land Registry, established on  May , are active and fully in force.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization objects to a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice, handed down in respect of a dispute over the failure to deduct union dues for a trade union of clerical workers at the land registry office, according to which:  clerical officials working at a land registry office may not establish trade unions as the regime governing them, which is established in the Courts Organization Code, is incompatible with the regime that governs unionized workers' 
.The Committee observes the Government s statements that: () as soon as the judicial declaration of the Supreme Court was known (issued in the framework of an administrative consultation), the Legal Department of the Labour Directorate prepared a document in which it is established that the Labour Directorate has classified the offices of notaries and registrars as enterprises for the purposes of the rights and obligations of their workers, and that they are governed by the provisions of the Labour Code; () the Santiago land registry did not object to the establishment of trade unions, but according to the Government refused to deduct the union dues and as a result was fined on two occasions in accordance with the provisions of articles  and  of the Labour Code by the administrative authority; the Ministry of Labour is currently seeking to reconcile the parties in this respect; and () the Trade Union of the Santiago Land Registry, established in March , and Trade Union No.  of the Santiago Land Registry, established in May , are active and fully in force.
.The Committee observes that in this case clerical workers at land registries were able to set up the trade union organizations of their own choosing, that the Supreme Court of Justice considered in an opinion that  clerical officials working at a land registry office may not establish trade unions'  and that nevertheless the administrative authority considered that this category of workers was entitled to establish trade unions in accordance with article , final clause, of the Labour Code. In these conditions, the Committee recalls that, in accordance with the provisions of Convention No. , all workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police, should be able to establish organizations of their own choosing to promote and defend the interests of their members, and requests the Government to go on ensuring this right to the category of workers who provide services for land registries.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes the sanctions imposed in accordance with legislation by the administrative authority on the Santiago land registry on two occasions for not having deducted union dues, as stipulated by law, and requests the Government to ensure that the relevant legislation (article  of the Labour Code which provides that the employer shall make the corresponding deduction and deposit it in the current or savings account of the respective trade union organization(s)) is complied with in this area.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With respect to the judicial declaration by the Supreme Court of Justice according to which workers providing services at a land registry office are not entitled to set up trade unions, the Committee recalls that in accordance with the provisions of Convention No.  all workers, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and the police, should be able to establish organizations of their own choosing to promote and defend the interests of their members, and requests the Government to go on ensuring this right to the category of workers in question.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure compliance with legislation (article  of the Labour Code which provides that the employer shall make the corresponding deduction and deposit it in the current or savings account of the respective trade union organization(s)) relating to the deduction of union dues for members of workers' organizations in the land registry sector.",0,2002,Chile
134,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Confederation of Health Care Workers (CONFENATS) dated  July . The organization sent additional information in a communication of December .
.The Government replied in a communication dated  April .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  July and December , the National Confederation of Health Care Workers (CONFENATS) alleges that its legitimate and autonomous representation was disregarded through the conclusion of agreements between government authorities and persons claiming to represent the health workers' union; its current president and national executive have been disregarded, which constitutes interference in the organization s internal affairs, and foments discord and deceit among its members. This occurred on two occasions. First, an attempt was made to impose on CONFENATS a -point agreement on public health system reform, falsely claiming involvement of the organization by having it signed by only two members of the national executive (comprised of  members), neither of whom hold the office of president or have received a mandate for the purpose ' this despite the express reservation put forward by the official delegation concerning the signing of that document during the negotiation of the agreement. To make matters worse, an official ceremony was held in the Government Palace, which was attended by the Vice-President of the Republic and several ministers and broadcast over the radio and television, and to which the persons who had supplanted the legitimate and lawful representatives of the Confederation were expressly invited.
.A similarly despicable procedure occurred a few weeks later, this time in the form of a document containing a proposal by government representatives to close the negotiations on remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment, which, as agreed by the CONFENATS national assembly, should have been submitted to consultation through a national and universal referendum to be held in July , in order to approve or reject it. Notwithstanding the fact that the government negotiators were fully aware of the organization s decision to submit the proposal to democratic consultation of the membership, they did not hesitate to contrive to have a very small minority of the officers sign the agreement, substituting themselves illegally for the will of the majority of the members of the national executive. It should be pointed out in this respect that the Minister of Health expressed to these officers the  commitment to working together for a strong and representative organization' ' a clear and obvious sign of intervention in CONFENATS' internal affairs. In the referendum subsequently held by CONFENATS in July , , workers rejected the Government s proposal and  approved it ' representing  per cent of CONFENATS members.
.CONFENATS further alleges direct intervention by government authorities in the internal organization of the Confederation: disregarding its representative trade union organs and organizational structure, several representatives of the Government, exceeding their authority, organized meetings and assemblies of CONFENATS affiliates in different public health establishments across the country, pressuring members to attend the meetings, at which they put forward their views on the negotiations and issues being discussed with the trade union s national executive. These constitute repeated and continuous acts of flagrant interference in the Confederation s internal activities. In so doing, they bypass the trade union s executive organs elected by the members and bring direct pressure to bear on members to accept their views, which openly contradict the opinions expressed by the national executive.
.In addition, CONFENATS points out that, during discussions on the changes in remuneration and terms of employment which will accompany the public health system reform, and the salary adjustments described above, there have regrettably been repeated instances of police intervention and use of force. The police have used violence against trade union members and officers, who were detained, beaten (including an assault on trade union officer, Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal), and prevented from meeting and demonstrating at their workplaces and in public areas; these acts included the trial of and imposition of a penalty against the national president of the organization in a local police court on  May  for allegedly creating a public disturbance. It should be pointed out that the excessive use of force by the police was backed by the government authorities, despite the seriousness of the injuries inflicted on members.
.In its communication dated  April , the Government refers to the allegation that legitimate representation by the CONFENATS executive was disregarded through the signing of agreements between Ministry of Health authorities and persons who were not entitled to represent the workers. The Government states that, as part of the challenge of health care reform ' one of the main tasks facing the Government ' the Ministry of Health considered it a priority task to reach agreement with the different health unions on issues relating to their professional and occupational demands, especially wage increases and demands. Since the first year of President Lagos' administration, with Ms. Michelle Bachelet as Minister of Health, talks, consultations and negotiations were held with the different unions in the public health sector. Dialogue committees had been set up, and had been functioning for over two years, with regular meetings to hear views prior to embarking on the health system reform known as the AUGE plan.
.The Government points out that, with regard to the health sector reform and its implications and impact, in the first half of  the health sector unions decided to engage in dialogue and negotiate with the Ministry of Health, which led to the establishment of the National Council of Health Unions (CONGRES). This has been, and still is, the main interlocutor of the Government, through the Ministry, and all the agreements adopted together have been complied with. Thus, on  May , the Ministry of Health and CONGRES signed an  Agreement for better health and health care for all the inhabitants of Chile'  This document was ratified on  May  at a ceremony held at the Palacio de la Moneda (the Government Palace), and although some of the officers of CONFENATS did not sign it, others did, in agreement with CONGRES.
.The Government adds that, through the Ministry of Health, it has continued to negotiate specific issues essentially relating to remuneration, public service career development and terms of employment (in a manner that is fairly consistent with the recommendations of ILO Convention No. ), with the different trade unions in the national health-care system. Accordingly, in parallel with negotiations with CONGRES, channels of communication and dialogue have been maintained with the Confederation of Municipal Health Workers (CONFUSAM), with which agreement was reached on  March , and with CONFENATS, an organization grouping together the regional federations of public health employees who mainly work in the hospital system. The latter expressed its willingness to initiate a bargaining process, as it had already done with the Government, through a negotiating committee comprised of the CONFENATS officers.
.The Government points out that on  July  an agreement was signed between the Ministry of Health and CONFENATS, represented by officers, Mr. Claudio Capees and Mr. Roberto Zambrano, two of the eight members of the abovementioned negotiating committee. The agreement was also signed by the executive committees (represented by their presidents) of seven of the  regional federations which made up CONFENATS at that time. The main points of agreement are as follows:' by  July at the latest, the Ministry of Health was to submit a Bill to Parliament containing provisions for:n the introduction of a performance allowance equivalent to an  per cent adjustment in the base remuneration;n payment of an advance in the last quarter of , and of a bonus to all health service employees;n improvement of the system of merit-based promotion of permanent officials by developing an accreditation system taking into account continuous training variables, performance evaluation and qualified experience. The Ministry s proposal to introduce a system of promotion through internal competition for management and professionals is to be maintained;n implementation of an incentive system to encourage retirement of staff qualifying for retirement;' normalize staffing levels through administrative measures, according to vacant permanent posts;' increase investment in staff training; participation of the most representative health workers' organization in training committees;' maintain the current system of staffing based on posts rather than hours.
.The Government goes on to state that it is clear that all of the above are aimed at improving the terms of employment of public health workers through salary increases, greater participation and a substantial increase in staff training. The agreement is the result of the work of a negotiating committee comprised of all of the health unions and the different services of the Ministry of Health. When the time came to sign the agreement and publicize it, the top leadership of the CONFENATS refused to sign it, disregarding and spurning",-1,2002,Chile
135,"the work that had been accomplished, which meant going back to square one. Nevertheless, the agreement was ratified by seven of the  regional federations, representing  per cent of the CONFENATS membership. This agreement, which by any standard represents a step forward in the conditions of employment of health workers, was disregarded by the CONFENATS executive committee. Its refusal to sign it is the result of internal problems in the union, manifested in failed elections, officers virtually being removed from office and the establishment of a parallel trade union organ. The problems relating to elections and challenging of officers occurred in  and . The Government emphasizes that the degree of representativity of the officers who signed the agreement with the Ministry of Health is not a matter for the Government to settle, but that it is the trade union organization itself which must determine its representative bodies. The agreement briefly outlined in the preceding paragraphs is an expression of the trade union officers' willingness to reach agreements that would benefit both parties and protect the workers' rights.
.The Government reached a similar agreement with the National Federation of University Professionals in the Health Services (FENPRUSS) on  July . In addition to the many meetings and forums for dialogue set up with the health sector unions, at the same time the Government has complied with previous agreements principally relating to payment of various bonuses and improvements in terms of employment.
.The Government states that, through the bodies responsible for supervision of compliance with labour legislation, as well as the press, it was aware that most of the trade union officers of CONFENATS had resigned from leadership of the Confederation, having decided to set up a new confederation temporarily to follow up on the agreements set forth in a Bill now before Parliament.
. FENATS Unitaria' is a legally constituted trade union organization that cannot be disregarded by the Government, in so far as it meets all the conditions required to function according to the law. FENATS Unitaria was founded on  October , with a membership of approximately , workers in Regions III, V, VII, VIII, IX and X and the metropolitan area. Its provisional executive committee was comprised of  officers. Subsequently, according to the records filed with the Labour Directorate, the first congress of the national confederation FENATS Unitaria was held in the city of Temuco on  January , at which a definitive executive committee comprised of  officers was elected. FENATS Unitaria was established under the protection of ILO Convention No.  and in the exercise of the fundamental right of freedom of association.
.Regarding the accusation that the Ministry of Health has interfered in the internal affairs of CONFENATS, the Government states that this is not true, since it is clear from press statements by ministry authorities that the latter have on numerous occasions expressed their willingness to continue supporting the trade union movement in all its manifestations, without any interference whatsoever. The Ministry s web site contains the following statement:  We are now forging a major alliance with the workers in order to improve the quality of work in hospitals to provide better care to users.' The Ministry concludes by stating its commitment to working together for a strong and representative health workers' organization. In this respect, it should be pointed out that the spirit of these statements by the outgoing Minister of Health, Mr. Osvaldo Artaza, is in full conformity with Article  of Convention No. , which provides as follows:  Such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations as may be appropriate in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.As regards the alleged direct intervention by the health authorities in the organization and functioning of CONFENATS by organizing meetings and assemblies of its members in the various public health establishments in the country, without taking the national executive into consideration, the Government states that the campaign to publicize the Government s activities, through the Ministry of Health, jointly with the trade unions, reflects the Ministry s intention to disseminate as clearly as possible the scope of the agreements reached in order to ensure that all the public health employees in Chile have a better knowledge and understanding of them. The Ministry convenes all the employees of a given establishment to these dissemination events, irrespective of the union to which they belong, and it is therefore utterly untrue and incorrect that the health authorities have interfered in the functioning of CONFENATS. It should be made clear that at no time did any authority whatsoever of the Ministry of Health or other government department attempt to influence the decisions, functioning, establishment or administration of any trade union organization. Respect for one of the principles governing the functioning of the Government in labour matters, i.e. permanent and constructive dialogue with all of the trade unions, cannot be considered as undue interference.
.As regards the use of police violence against members and officers of CONFENATS who were allegedly detained, beaten and prevented from demonstrating at their workplaces and public areas (including the detention of and imposition of a penalty by a court against the president of FENATS, Mr. Jorge Araya Guerra, and the secretary of FENPRUSS, Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal), the Government states that the actions of the police forces are dictated by the normal procedures in the event of disturbances in public areas which disrupt civic order ' acts which are covered by Chilean legislation. Within this legal framework, which applies to each and every one of the country s inhabitants, the competent bodies of the judiciary branch, which is independent of the Government, decided to impose a penalty on Mr. Jorge Araya, without the Government of Chile having interfered in any way in his being sentenced to a fine. This penalty was suspended by the court for one year. The alleged assault on Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal occurred during a protest by a minority group of health workers outside the National Congress, while members of Parliament were discussing issues relating to the health reform.
.The accusation of anti-union practices levelled by CONFENATS against the Government of Chile reflects the current political and trade union situation in the country, in terms of opposition to processes of dialogue and negotiation from which both parties stand to benefit. Lastly, with a view to further improving the national health system, together with the workers employed in it, the Government declares that both it and the different authorities of the Ministry of Health reiterate their willingness to continue dialogue with each and every one of the health unions, in an effort to achieve a health system which is egalitarian, fair and comprehensive for all of Chile s inhabitants.
.As regards the allegation concerning the conclusion of agreements on public health sector reform between government authorities and only two members of the National Confederation of Health Care Workers (CONFENATS) national executive committee (comprised of  members) who did not hold a mandate to do so, and the acceptance by these two persons of a government proposal to close negotiations on adjustments to remuneration and other terms of employment despite the fact that such acceptance should have been submitted to a national (trade union) referendum, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the agreement referred to by the complainant (CONFENATS) was signed and ratified by some of the officers of the Confederation (two of the eight participating in the negotiating committee); () on  July another agreement (on salary adjustment and other issues) was signed with two officers of CONFENATS, which was also ratified by the executive committees (represented by their presidents) of seven of the  regional federations affiliated to CONFENATS ( per cent of the CONFENATS membership); () the refusal by the CONFENATS executive to sign the agreement is the result of internal problems within the Confederation, and the degree of representativity of the officers who signed the agreement with the Ministry of Health is not a matter for the Government to settle; () most of the officers of CONFENATS left the Confederation and established a new confederation (FENATS Unitaria); and () the authorities engaged in similar negotiations with other trade union organizations in the sector.
.In the Committee s view, the conclusion by the authorities of agreements with a reduced number of representatives (two) despite the massive rejection of the Government s proposal by the workers, and without a mandate from the trade union organs could, in certain circumstances, constitute an anti-union practice. In this case, however, the negotiation of agreements with representatives who do not hold a mandate from the trade union organs of CONFENATS occurred in the context of a major conflict within a trade union which in fact led to the establishment of a new trade union confederation. In this respect, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the presidents of seven of the  regional",-1,2002,Chile
136,"federations affiliated to CONFENATS ( per cent of the membership) signed the (second) agreement concluded on  July . The Committee observes that the complainant has not cited government pressure on the two trade union representatives in question to sign the agreements to which the complainant objects. In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the actual facts appear to have occurred in the context of an internal conflict within the complainant organization, on which the Committee is not in a position to decide.
.As regards the alleged interference by the authorities in the internal organization of CONFENATS, by organizing meetings and assemblies of CONFENATS affiliates to bring pressure to bear on members and put forward the authorities' views in the negotiating process, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the campaign to publicize the Government s activities, through the Ministry of Health, jointly with the trade unions, reflects the Ministry s intention to disseminate as clearly as possible the scope of the agreements reached; () there was no attempt to influence the decisions or functioning of any trade union organization, but only to conduct permanent and constructive dialogue with all of the trade union organizations; and () the Ministry convened all of the employees of a given establishment irrespective of the trade union organization to which they belonged, and hence it is untrue and incorrect that the authorities interfered in the functioning of CONFENATS. In these circumstances, given that, according to the Government, these were information meetings to which all the workers of the establishments were convened, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations further.
.As regards the allegation of the use of police violence against trade union officers and members (detentions, beatings, assault on trade union officer, Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal, preventing the exercise of the right of assembly and demonstration on  May ; judicial proceedings and imposition of a penalty against the President of CONFENATS, Mr. Jorge Araya, for alleged creating a public disturbance), the Committee notes that the Government points out that the actions of the police forces are dictated by the normal procedures in the event of disturbances in public areas which disrupt civic order, and hence the Government did not interfere in the penalty imposed by the judicial authority on trade union officers, Mr. Jorge Araya (a fine suspended for one year) and Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal. The Committee observes that the Government does not specify what constituted the disturbances disrupting civic order and reminds the Government of the principle that the authorities should resort to the use of force only in situations where law and order is seriously threatened. The intervention of the forces of law and order should be in due proportion to the danger to law and order that the authorities are attempting to control and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to eliminate the danger entailed by the use of excessive violence when controlling demonstrations which might result in a disturbance of the peace [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ].
.The Committee requests the Government to forward to it the decisions handed down against trade union officers, Mr. Jorge Araya and Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal (indicating, if they are not stated in the decisions, the specific acts of which these persons are accused) and further information concerning the alleged assault against trade union officer, Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal, and the public disturbance leading to police intervention in the demonstrations by CONFENATS officers and members on  May .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to forward to it the decisions handed down against trade union officers, Mr. Jorge Araya and Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal (indicating, if they are not stated in the decisions, the specific acts of which these persons are accused) and further information concerning the alleged assault against trade union officer, Mr. Mauricio Loo Vidal, and the public disturbance leading to police intervention in the demonstrations by CONFENATS officers and members on  May .",-1,2002,Chile
137,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in June  [see th Report, paras. -], and on that occasion:(a) As regards the allegations of acts of intimidation and violence by the police during a gathering of striking workers outside the company s buildings on  and  May  (resulting in workers being injured and detained), the Committee noted that the Government had written to the Governor of the Province of Quillota and was waiting for a reply. The Committee requested the Government to send the Governor s report on those matters as soon as he received it.(b) With regard to the dismissal of workers enjoying trade union immunity at Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A., the Committee noted the Government s statement that the court had admitted the judicial proceedings concerning anti-union practices against union official, Mr. Jorge Murua Saavedra, and had ordered his reinstatement, imposed heavy fines on the enterprise for unfair practices in collective bargaining and placed it on the list of enterprises found guilty of anti-union practices. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the effective reinstatement of Mr. Saavedra.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states with regard to the judicial hearing at which the reinstatement of the trade union leader Jorge Murua Saavedra was ordered, that the company refused to comply with the order handed down in  and that consequently the court issued a warrant for the arrest of the company s legal representative (as the representative was not found, a warning fine was imposed). The Government states, lastly, that the legal counsel dealing with the case, together with the union, is examining strategies for enforcing the ruling.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the ruling ordering the reinstatement of the union leader Jorge Murua Saavedra in the company, Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A., this has not been given effect. Under these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the trade union leader in question will be reinstated in his post in the near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. At the same time, the Committee requests the Government to communicate the information that has been requested concerning the alleged acts of intimidation and violence by the police against striking workers on  and  May  during a gathering in front of the company, Sopravel S.A. (which resulted in a number of people being injured and detained).
.The Committee last examined this case at its May-June  meeting and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see st Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  January and  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its May-June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the outstanding issues [see st Report, para. ]:Sopraval S.A.(a) With regard to the allegations of acts of intimidation and violence by the police during a gathering of striking workers outside the company s buildings on  and  May  (resulting in workers being injured and detained), the Committee requests the Government to send it the report which the Governor of the Province promised to request and to ensure that investigations begin into the allegations and, if appropriate, that the sanctions provided for in legislation are applied.(b) With regard to allegations relating to company interference in holding a meeting to vote for censure of the union leadership, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organization to keep it informed of the final decision of the judicial authority in this respect.(c) With regard to the rest of the allegations of acts which might have been committed on the part of Sopraval S.A.

In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this respect and inform it as to whether the judicial proceedings for anti-union practices mentioned generally in its reply refer to any of the pending allegations.]Cecinas San Jorge S.A.(d) With regard to the company s alleged promotion of a union, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in the future, as well as to inform it of the outcome of any legal action which the administrative labour authority brings before the judicial authority.(e) The Committee requests the Government to take measures ensuring that collective negotiation at Cecinas San Jorge S.A. takes place with the workers' organizations which have been freely formed by the workers, as well as examining the legality of the collective contract with the union which the Government describes as  biased' towards the company.(f) With regard to the allegation relating to the dismissal of Alvaro Zamorano Miranda, president of the Cecinas San Jorge Inter-company Union and the Cecinas San Jorge Company Union, the Committee requests the Government to make renewed efforts with the company to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed union leader and to take measures to avoid the repetition of such acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations according to which the company dismissed nine union members during negotiations of a collective contract on  October  and on  October  began slander proceedings against union officer Alvaro Zamorano Miranda for having stated that the company had offered money to workers to resign from the union.Bakery companies(h) With regard to the dismissal, without having previously obtained judicial authorization, of Juan Aros Donoso, officer of the Federation of Breadworkers of the th Region and president of the Via del Mar Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry from the company of Manuel Regueiro, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to investigate whether the dismissal in question took place and, if so, to inform it of the specific facts behind it. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A.(i) With regard to the alleged dismissal of nine workers enjoying union protection between  and  July , during the start of the process of negotiating a folder of petitions, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the final judicial ruling on these dismissals.
.In its communications of  January and  February , the Government states, with regard to the allegations relating to the Sopraval S.A. company, that it had already sent a reply in the framework of a request for intervention to the",1,2002,Chile
138,"ILO by an international trade union organization that is not a complainant in the present case. The Government sent this reply in an annex which can be summarized as follows:' With regard to the hostile behaviour and threats to freedom of association, the labour inspector who contributed to the examination of the complaint interviewed the new officials of the trade union of the Sopraval S.A. company, Cristin Feli Briones, secretary of the company s trade union, and Leonardo Saldao Orrego, president of the company s trade union since  January . The latter indicated that they had no proof of the events having taken place. In accordance with article  of the Labour Code, the labour courts of the first instance are responsible for hearing and deciding violations through anti-union acts. The labour services have been informed that the La Calera Court of Letters is hearing a complaint of anti-union practices in Case No. .-, which covers non-payment of trade union dues deducted by the company, the alleged harassment and dismissal of Nelson Orellana Ramrez, the payment of his wages since May  and not providing work clothing as laid down in the collective contract, etc. There are currently two legal proceedings for anti-union practices awaiting decision.' With regard to the allegations relating to the interference by the Sopraval S.A. company in holding a meeting to vote for censure of the union leadership, the Government states that on  December  the vote of censure of the union leadership of the  Sergio Pincheira' trade union of the Sopraval S.A. company took place before the Public Notary Moiss Corvaln Vera, with the participation of  members,  of whom approved the censure and four of whom rejected it. The union leadership thus censured comprised Nelson Alejandro Orellana Ramrez (president), Cristin Rodrigo Feli Briones (secretary) and Germn Fernando Toro Muoz (treasurer). On  January , the new executive committee of the Sopraval S.A. company trade union  Sergio Pincheira' was elected, before the deputy secretary who is a lawyer of the Municipality of La Calera, Mr. Jorge Hctor Torres Jaa, acting as a public notary. The new executive committee comprised Heiter Leonardo Saldao Orrego (president), Juan Olmos Fuenzalida (secretary) and Pedro Tapia Cspedes (treasurer).' With regard to the allegations of acts of intimidation and violence by the police during a gathering of striking workers outside the Sopraval S.A. company s buildings (resulting in workers being injured and detained) on  and  May , the Government indicates that the regional labour directorates must respect Service Order No.  of , which aims to prevent the occurrence of events such as those figuring in the complaint in labour conflicts and strikes and to reconcile the right of workers to express themselves with maintaining public order and social harmony so that the workers may freely exercise their rights without being harassed or prevented from expressing their opinions by any state institution. Given that article  of the Labour Code lays down that the labour courts are competent to hear and decide violations through anti-union practices, if the Labour Services were to define certain acts as being anti-union in nature they would be superseding their powers. The Labour Services must act within the legal powers that the legislation in force grants them and it would be unconstitutional to go beyond these, in accordance with article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic, which lays down that:  the state bodies shall act through regular investiture of its members, within their competency and in the manner laid down in law'  The role of the Labour Services is to inform the courts when it is required to do so with regard to the stated facts.
.With regard to the dismissal of trade union official Alvaro Zamorano Miranda on  October , the Government states that this is related to the establishment of a parallel trade union with the backing of the Cecinas San Jorge company (an issue already examined by the Committee in its previous examination of the case); the Labour Inspectorate fined the company  months' minimum salary and requested the company to reinstate the union officer in question on  December , without success. The Government states that the reports issued on these matters by the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Poniente are currently being revised for their possible lodging in a complaint before the ordinary courts.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of Juan Aros Donoso, president of the Via del Mar Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry, the Government repeats its statement that there has been no complaint in this respect.
.With regard to the dismissal of nine workers enjoying trade union immunity from the Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A. company, the Government, after recalling that the Ministry of Labour had fined the company, states that the two proceedings (one of which was begun by the Ministry of Labour) took place in two courts: in one case (that begun by the Ministry) the court ordered the reinstatement of the workers dismissed (which the enterprise refused to do), and in the other (initiated by the executive committee of the trade union) the court must decide on the issue of litispendence arising from the fact that the case was being heard by another court at the same time; in any case, and if the decision of this court rejects the complaint for anti-union practices, there is always the possibility of appeal.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:Sopraval S.A.(a) Noting that the two legal proceedings for anti-union practices are awaiting decisions, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decisions handed down with regard to the allegations relating to  (threats to freedom of association of the members of the trade union, harassment and dismissal of the former trade union official Nelson Orellana Ramrez, interference by the company in a vote of censure of the former executive committee of the trade union).(b) With regard to the allegations relating to , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the labour courts (and not the Ministry of Labour) have the authority to hear and decide issues relating to violations through anti-union practices.(c) With regard to the allegations of acts of intimidation and violence by the police during a gathering of striking workers outside the company s buildings on  and  May  (resulting in workers being injured and detained), the Committee once again requests the Government to send the report which it promised to request from the Governor of the Province without delay and to ensure that investigations begin into the allegations and, if appropriate, that the sanctions provided for in legislation are applied.Cecinas San Jorge S.A.(d) With regard to the dismissal of trade union official Alvaro Zamorano Miranda, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any new administrative or judicial decisions taken and expects that the trade union official will be reinstated in his post shortly. The Committee regrets to note that the Government has not sent its observations on the other allegations according to which the company began slander proceedings against union officer Alvaro Zamorano Miranda. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any judicial decision in this respect, and of any administrative or judicial decision on the alleged promotion by the company of a trade union.Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A.(e) With regard to the dismissal of nine workers enjoying trade union protection, the Committee notes that according to the Government s statements no final decision has been issued on this matter and it requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Bakery companies(f) The Committee notes that no complaint has been laid with regard to the alleged dismissal of trade union official Juan Aros Donoso and that it is for the judicial authorities to decide issues relating to violations through anti-union practices.
.The complaints are contained in a communication from the Chilean General Confederation of Workers (CGT) dated August  and in a communication from the National Union of Metal, Communication and Energy Workers and Related Activities, dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of August , the Chilean General Confederation of Workers (CGT) alleges that acts of anti-union discrimination and physical aggression have been carried out against union officers and members from various companies. Specifically, the CGT makes the following allegations:(i) Sopraval S.A. The complainant alleges that, beginning in , the company carried out the following acts against the union and its members: () in May  it offered maintenance workers a pay rise if they resigned from the union, which led to the resignation of all members in that sector; () in July  it dismissed Mr. Jos Figueroa for standing",-1,2002,Chile
139,"as a union officer; () in August  six workers were dismissed from the rendering section for joining the union; () in August  the company obstructed the awarding of union permits, it has not deducted . per cent from the salary of workers benefiting from the collective contract, and it has announced that it will not make deductions from union loans to workers, thus causing financial damage to the union; () on  September  the company dismissed  workers who were union members, on the grounds of company necessity; () in October  it put pressure on workers ' union members and non-members ' to accept a collective agreement with a  per cent pay cut and also offered loans to workers who would resign from the union; () in November  it dismissed  union members who had participated in a protest in the Senate against the law on severance pay related to years of service; () in January ,  union members were shut in and forced to sign union resignations; () in March  the process of collective negotiation began and the company offered the same conditions of employment to both union members and non-members and in consequence, on  and  May , the union declared a legal strike and the company used the police to intimidate strikers and to help strike-breakers cross picket lines. On this occasion the police wounded and detained workers assembled outside the company s buildings; () the president of the union, Mr. Orellana Ramrez, was threatened with death during the strike; () after the strike the company began a judicial process against Mr. Orellana Ramrez in order to lift his trade union immunity and dismiss him and as of May  ceased to pay his salary, also withholding the documents necessary for payment of sick leave; and () in December  in an attempt to dismiss the president of the union, the company encouraged a meeting to be held to vote for censure of the leadership. At the meeting, held on  December , such censure was put to the vote and passed in an irregular manner, given that a judicial action in this respect had already begun. Lastly, the complainant alleges that, although there was already an executive committee in place, elections for a new executive were held in an irregular manner (in the presence of a municipal secretary, who does not have the authority to oversee a union election).(ii) Cecinas San Jorge S.A. The CGT alleges that, after the creation of the Cecinas San Jorge Inter-company Union on  October , the management: () promoted the formation of another union and, having gathered its workers together on its premises, made them join this second union under threat of dismissal; () on  October  it dismissed the president of the union, Mr. Alvaro Zamorano, and prohibited him from entering company premises; () on  October  it dismissed nine union members during negotiation of a collective contract; and () on  October , after the Cecinas San Jorge Company Union had been formed and Mr. Zamorano elected president thereof, the company began slander proceedings against him for having stated that the company had offered money to workers to resign from the company s union.(iii) Bakery companies. () On  July , the company of Mr. Manuel Jess Carreo Daz dismissed without cause Mr. Ral Vargas Verdejo, president of the Federation of Bread Workers and president of the Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry and Similar Sectors; and () the company of Mr. Manuel Regueiro dismissed, without having previously obtained judicial authorization, Mr. Juan Aros Donoso, officer of the Federation of Bread Workers of the th Region and president of the Via del Mar Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry.
.In its communication dated  September , the National Union of Metal, Communication and Energy Workers and Related Activities alleges anti-union dismissals of workers enjoying union protection (special protection for workers involved in the process of collective negotiation) at Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A. The complainant specifically alleges that, after asking the company (on  July ) for information, with a view to submitting their collective bargaining demands, three workers enjoying trade union immunity were dismissed on  and  July. Subsequently, on  July, a folder of petitions was presented and the company dismissed eight more workers, also under trade union immunity. The complainant adds that the labour inspectorate was informed of these anti-union dismissals, that the inspectorate established the facts on  and  July  and that, on both occasions, the company refused to reinstate the workers. Lastly, the complainant notes that in August  it took its case to the judicial authority, which took more than a month to set a date for the parties to meet ( October ).
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states, with reference to the complaint relating to the union founded at Cecinas San Jorge S.A., that according to the registers there are four unions at the company in question: the Cecinas San Jorge S.A. Company Union, the National Union of Vendors and other workers of Cecinas San Jorge S.A., the  Cecinas San Jorge S.A.' Company Workers' Union, and the  Cecinas San Jorge S.A. and Other Workers' Inter-company Workers' Union. Mr. Alvaro Zamorano Miranda was a founding member of both the  Cecinas San Jorge S.A.' Company Workers' Union, an organization established on  October , and the  Cecinas San Jorge S.A. and Other Workers' Inter-company Workers' Union, established  October , and was elected president of both organizations. In this respect, and according to the same registers, he resigned from the post of president of the organizations on  December  and  October  respectively.
.The Government states, in accordance with information received from the labour inspectorate, that, at the point when the Inter-company Union was established, there were indeed problems with the company participating in promoting a parallel union; in this context, the company terminated the contract of employment of Mr. Zamorano, the president of the union, on  October , a dismissal which he then challenged, giving rise to a fine of ten months' salary being imposed for not providing the work agreed in the contract of employment, as laid down in resolution No. ....- dated  October .
.The Government reports that, on  December , a visit was carried out to the company, requiring the reinstatement of Mr. Zamorano, which the company declined to accept. Subsequently, a commission was established to investigate the complaints of anti-union practices, specifically the company s involvement in setting up a parallel union. The investigation enabled the conclusion to be drawn that there had indeed been some intervention on the part of the company in calling its workers together for a meeting on its premises to pressure them into joining this union. The meeting, according to the investigation, was organized and chaired by the company s legal representative. Later, the union biased towards the company quickly signed a collective contract, to the detriment of the other organizations. The reports drawn up by the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Poniente are being examined so that the case can be taken before the ordinary justice tribunals, in accordance with the applicable legal provisions.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the bakery companies of the th Region, the Government states that the Regional Labour Directorate of the th Region has reported on the situation of the officers in question: (a) Mr. Manuel Jess Carreo Daz, president of the Quintero Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry and Similar Sectors and director of the Federation of Workers of the Bread Industry and others brought a complaint of illegal separation of functions before the labour inspectorate on  July ; after several inspection visits resulting in an equal number of sanctions against the employer, Mr. Ral Vargas, he reinstated the officer in question on  July  with payment of the salary owing; and (b) with regard to Mr. Juan Aros Donoso, president of the Via del Mar Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry, the labour inspectorate reported that no complaint had been brought against the employer, Mr. Manuel Regueiro, for the alleged dismissal.
.Regarding the allegations relating to Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A., the Government reports that, in accordance with Labour Directorate precedent, the company s workers brought a complaint before the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspectorate about the dismissal of nine workers enjoying trade union immunity, as a result of the process of collective negotiation that took place.
.The Government states that the fines appropriate to the illegal dismissal of workers (two fines of  months' salary each) have been sanctioned and applied. With regard to anti-union practices, the Government adds that on  September  the labour inspectorate, following the inspection and analysis process in strict accordance with the instructions in force, presented before the th Labour Court of Santiago a complaint of illegal separation of nine workers due to the collective negotiation",2,2002,Chile
140,"in which they were involved (inter-company negotiations subject to the regulations contained in section bis of the Labour Code). The union leadership later informed the labour inspectorate that on  August  it had complained of the same anti-union practice to the th Labour Court of Santiago; on  February  the labour inspectorate became involved in the case.
.The Government reports that, on  October , the th Labour Court gave its ruling, rejecting the complaint of anti-union practices, with clear legal errors, having agreed the (legally arguable) alternative that the complainants appeal the decision. In the case heard by the th Court, the company claimed litispendence (the case was being heard by another court at the same time), leaving a previous resolution ordering the reinstatement of the workers unimplemented. The company was notified of this on  November  but declined to act. Lastly, the Government notes that the ruling of the th Labour Court is still pending (it has not been implemented), meaning that the same is true of the resolution which applies in the case of the alleged litispendence in the th Labour Court. According to the Government, the Labour Directorate has carried out its task rigorously with the aim of reversing the conclusions of the th Labour Court in the aforementioned ruling.
.With regard to the allegations relating to Sopraval S.A., the Government states that, regarding the alleged hostile behaviour and threats to freedom of association, the labour inspector responsible for the case interviewed Mr. Cristin Feli Briones, secretary of the  Sergio Pincheira' Sopraval S.A. Company Union, and Mr. Leonardo Saldao Orrego, president of the same union since  January , who declared they had no proof of the events having taken place. The labour services have been made aware that the La Calera Court of Letters is examining a case of anti-union practices (Case No. .-).
.With regard to the process of collective negotiation which took place in May , the Government states that the legal strike agreed in the process of collective negotiation between Sopraval S.A. and the  Sergio Pincheira' Workers' Union began on  May  and involved  workers at the manufacturing plant, where  out of a total of  workers are employed. On the same day ( May ) an inspection visit was made to the company by an official from the Quillota Regional Labour Inspectorate in order to confirm the start of the strike, which was then described in the resulting inspection report. Likewise, the Inspectorate analysed the content and chances of the company s latest offer and concluded that it was not legally proper to contract replacement workers, since the necessary minimum conditions for this to happen were not present. For this reason, any form or mechanism of replacement would constitute an infringement of section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government adds that between  and  May five inspection visits were made to the company, some at the request of the negotiating committee and others arranged by the authorities of the labour services, in order to prevent possible infringements of section , in that the effective replacement of striking workers could have occurred despite the company not being legally authorized to do this. It was not possible during these visits to prove that Sopraval S.A. had contracted personnel to replace the striking workers and, as such, neither was it possible to establish a potential infringement of section  of the Labour Code. On  June ,  legally striking workers returned to their jobs, in accordance with the same section  of the Labour Code.
.With regard to the actions of the Chilean police during the process of collective negotiation and the legal strike, the Government states that it must be borne in mind that since  the Labour Directorate has maintained permanent coordination with the police force in order to prevent the occurrence of events such as those alleged by workers of the Sopraval company. As of  all regional labour directorates have received instructions, in Service Order No. , to establish a system of permanent coordination with the various police units in order to ensure that the development of the strike process, as well as any other type of labour conflict, is properly supervised by both institutions. This being the case, after the complaint about the actions of the police on  May , the first day of the strike, had been received, a meeting held in the Quillota Labour Inspectorate was attended by the Governor of the Province, who promised to request a report and ensure different conduct on the part of the forces of law and order. All this aims to allow workers to exercise their rights freely and not be harassed or prevented from expressing their opinions by any institution of the State.
.Lastly, the Government states that, on  December , before the Public Notary, Mr. Moiss Corvaln Vera, the vote to censure the leadership of the  Sergio Pincheira' Sopraval S.A. Company Union took place with  members voting,  in favour of censure and  against. On  January , before the acting lawyer-secretary of the st Municipality of La Calera, Mr. Jorge Hctor Torres Jaa, a new leadership of the  Sergio Pincheira' Sopraval S.A. Company Union was elected, consisting of Mr. Heiter Leonardo Saldao Orrego (president), Mr. Juan Olmos Fuenzalida (secretary) and Mr. Pedro Tapia Cspedes (treasurer).
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainants allege that various acts of anti-union discrimination have taken place at Sopraval S.A., Cecinas San Jorge, Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A. and two bakery companies.Sopraval S.A.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the use of strike-breakers during the legal strike which took place at the company from  May , the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the administrative authority undertook five inspection visits in this respect and was unable to establish that the company had contracted personnel to replace the striking workers.
.With regard to the allegations of acts of intimidation and violence by the police during a gathering of striking workers outside the company s buildings (resulting in workers being injured and detained), the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () since  the Labour Directorate has maintained permanent coordination with the police force in order to prevent the occurrence of events such as those figuring in the complaint; () as of  all regional labour directorates have received instructions in a service order to establish a system of permanent coordination with the various police units in order to ensure that the development of the strike process is properly supervised by both institutions; () after the complaint about the actions of the police on  May  during the strike had been received, the Governor of the Province promised to request a report and ensure different conduct on the part of the forces of law and order; and () the measures adopted by the Government are aimed at allowing workers to exercise their rights freely and not be harassed or prevented from expressing their opinions by any institution of the State. In this respect, the Committee recalls that  in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings or demonstrations by the police for reasons of public order or other similar reasons has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities' and that  the arrest and detention of trade unionists without any charges being laid or court warrants being issued constitutes a serious violation of trade union rights' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ]. In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to send the report which the Governor of the Province promised to request and to ensure that investigations begin into the allegations and, if appropriate, that the sanctions provided for in legislation are applied.
.With regard to the allegations relating to company interference in holding a meeting to vote for censure of the union leadership, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the censure vote took place on  December  before a public notary and that  members voted,  in favour of censure and  against. The Committee observes that the complainant reports that a judicial action in this regard has begun. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organization to keep it informed of the final decision of the judicial authority.
.With regard to the allegation relating to irregularities which occurred in the election of a new union leadership, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that on  January  a new union leadership was elected before the acting secretary of the Municipality of La Calera. In this regard, the Committee",-1,2002,Chile
141,"recalls that on numerous occasions it has stated that  when internal disputes arise in a trade union organization they should be resolved by the persons concerned (for example, by a vote), by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on the rest of the allegations of acts which might have been committed on the part of Sopraval and which follow: () in May  it offered maintenance workers a pay rise if they resigned from the union, which led to the resignation of all members in that sector; () in July  it dismissed Mr. Jos Figueroa for standing as a union officer; () in August  six workers were dismissed from the rendering section for joining the union; () in August  the company obstructed the awarding of union permits, it has not deducted . per cent from the salary of workers benefiting from the collective contract, and it has announced that it will not make deductions from union loans to workers, thus causing financial damage to the union; () on  September  the company dismissed  workers who were union members on the grounds of the needs of the company; () in October  it put pressure on workers ' some union members, some not ' to accept a collective agreement with a  per cent pay cut and also offered loans to workers who would resign from the union; () in November  it dismissed  union members who had participated in a protest in the Senate against the law on severance pay related to years of service; () in January ,  union members were shut in and forced to sign union resignations; () the president of the union, Mr. Orellana Ramrez, was threatened with death during the strike which began on  May; () after the strike the company began a judicial process against Mr. Orellana Ramrez in order to lift his trade union immunity and dismiss him and as of May  ceased to pay his salary, also withholding the documents necessary for payment of sick leave. In these circumstances the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this respect and inform it as to whether the judicial proceedings for anti-union practices mentioned generally in its reply refer to any of the pending allegations.Cecinas San Jorge S.A.
.With regard to the company s alleged promotion of a union, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that an investigation was carried out which determined that the company had indeed organized and chaired a meeting of workers to pressure them into forming a union, and that the reports drawn up by the Communal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago are being examined so that the case can be taken before the ordinary justice tribunals, in accordance with the applicable legal provisions. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article  of Convention No.  establishes the total independence of workers' organizations with respect to employers and that promoting the establishment of a workers' organization on the part of an employer constitutes a serious violation of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in the future, as well as to inform it of the outcome of any judicial action which the administrative labour authority brings before the judicial authority.
.The Committee also observes that the Government reports that the union which was formed with a bias towards the company quickly signed a collective contract to the detriment of the other union organizations. In this regard, the Committee recalls that, taking into account the importance of the independence of the parties in collective bargaining, negotiations should not be conducted on behalf of employees or their organizations by bargaining representatives appointed by or under the domination of employers or their organizations [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ]. This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to take measures ensuring that collective negotiation at Cecinas San Jorge takes place with the workers' organizations which have been freely formed by the workers, as well as examining the legality of the collective agreement with the union which the Government describes as  biased' towards the company.
.With regard to the allegation relating to the dismissal of Mr. Alvaro Zamorano, president of the Cecinas San Jorge Inter-company Union and the Cecinas San Jorge Company Union, the Committee observes that the Government reports that: () in the context of the company s participation in the formation of a new union Mr. Alvaro Zamorano s contract of employment was terminated on  October ; and () the administrative authority imposed a fine of ten months' minimum salary on the company for not providing the work agreed in the contract of employment and on  December  requested the company to reinstate the union officer in question, without success. In this regard, the Committee recalls that:... one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to make renewed efforts with the company to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed union leader and to take measures to avoid the repetition of such acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee regrets to observe that the Government has not sent its observations on the other allegations, according to which the company dismissed nine union members during negotiation of a collective contract on  October  and on  October  initiated slander proceedings against union officer Mr. Alvaro Zamorano for having stated that the company had offered money to workers to resign from the union. The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations in this respect.Bakery companies
.With regard to the alleged dismissal without cause of Mr. Ral Vargas Verdejo, president of the Federation of Bread Workers and president of the Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry on  July  from the company of Mr. Manuel Jess Carreo Daz, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the administrative authority imposed various sanctions on the employer and that finally the officer in question was reinstated, with the payment of salary owing.
.With regard to the dismissal, without having previously obtained judicial authorization, of Mr. Juan Aros Donoso, officer of the Federation of Bread Workers of the th Region and president of the Via del Mar Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry, from the company of Mr. Manuel Regueiro, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that there has been no complaint in this respect. This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to investigate whether the dismissal in question took place and, if so, to inform it of the specific facts behind it. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of nine workers enjoying trade union immunity between  and  July , during the start of the process of negotiating a folder of petitions, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the administrative authority imposed two fines of  months' salary each on the company for the dismissals in question and brought a complaint before the judicial authority for illegal separation of workers enjoying trade union immunity stemming from collective negotiation (the complainant also brought a complaint before another court in this respect); () the complaint presented by the complainant was rejected, with a verdict which showed clear legal errors; () as regards the complaint presented by the administrative authority, the company claimed litispendence and therefore a reinstatement resolution which had been given was left unimplemented; and () the judicial authority now has to decide in the matter of the claim of litispendence made. In this regard, the Committee recalls that  the right of petition is a legitimate activity of trade union organizations and persons who sign such trade union petitions should not be reprimanded or punished for this type of activity' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].",2,2002,Chile
142,"The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the final judicial ruling on these dismissals.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:Sopraval S.A.(a) With regard to the allegations of acts of intimidation and violence by the police during a gathering of striking workers outside the company s buildings on  and  May  (resulting in workers being injured and detained), the Committee requests the Government to send it the report which the Governor of the Province promised to request and to ensure that investigations begin into the allegations and, if appropriate, that the sanctions provided for in legislation are applied.(b) With regard to allegations relating to company interference in holding a meeting to vote for censure of the union leadership, the Committee requests the Government and the complainant organization to keep it informed of the final decision of the judicial authority in this respect.(c) With regard to the rest of the allegations of acts which might have been committed on the part of Sopraval (allegations which are mentioned in the conclusions, last paragraph of the section on the enterprise in question), the Committee requests the Government to send its observations in this respect and inform it as to whether the judicial proceedings for anti-union practices mentioned generally in its reply refer to any of the pending allegations.Cecinas San Jorge S.A.(d) With regard to the company s alleged promotion of a union, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in the future, as well as to inform it of the outcome of any judicial action which the administrative labour authority brings before the judicial authority.(e) The Committee requests the Government to take measures ensuring that collective negotiation at Cecinas San Jorge S.A. takes place with the workers' organizations which have been freely formed by the workers, as well as examining the legality of the collective contract with the union which the Government describes as  biased' towards the company.(f) With regard to the allegation relating to the dismissal of Mr. Alvaro Zamorano, president of the Cecinas San Jorge Inter-company Union and the Cecinas San Jorge Company Union, the Committee requests the Government to make renewed efforts with the company to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed union leader and to take measures to avoid the repetition of such acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations according to which the company dismissed nine union members during negotiation of a collective contract on  October  and on  October  began slander proceedings against union officer Mr. Alvaro Zamorano for having stated that the company had offered money to workers to resign from the union.Bakery companies(h) With regard to the dismissal, without having previously obtained judicial authorization, of Mr. Juan Aros Donoso, officer of the Federation of Bread Workers of the th Region and president of the Via del Mar Inter-company Union of the Bread Industry, from the company of Mr. Manuel Regueiro, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to investigate whether the dismissal in question took place and, if so, to inform it of the specific facts behind it. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Electroerosin Japax Chile S.A.(i) With regard to the alleged dismissal of nine workers enjoying union protection between  and  July , during the start of the process of negotiating a folder of petitions, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the final judicial ruling on these dismissals.",1,2002,Chile
143,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in June , and on that occasion requested the Government to communicate the text of the final ruling given concerning the dismissal of the trade union official Mr. Yapur Ruiz and to take all measures in its power to ensure that he was reinstated until such time as a decision was given on the latest legal action after the successive judicial decisions ordering his reinstatement [see th Report, paras. -].
.In a communication dated  September , the Government states that Mr. Yapur Ruiz has been reinstated, in accordance with the judicial ruling.
.The Committee notes this information with interest.
.At its meeting in May-June , the Committee made the following recommendations on certain questions that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) In view of the circumstances of this case, the Committee once again requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the trade union official, Mr. Yapur Ruz, is reinstated in his post at least until the last appeal brought before the courts is settled and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region, (ESVAL S.A.), the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation in this respect and keep it informed of its result.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government sends abundant information on the four rulings ordering the reinstatement of the trade union official, Erik Dusan Yapur Ruiz, and on a new legal action by the employer before the appellate court concerning the implementation of the ruling of the Court of First Instance.
.As regards the alleged anti-union practices by the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region (ESVAL S.A.) against the union and its president and sole member, Mr. Aquiles Mercado, the Government states that the trade union in question is currently inactive as a result of the ruling of the Regional Electoral Tribunal of the Vth Region which annulled all official acts carried out by Mr. Aquiles Mercado as representative of the trade union after  March , especially those relating to amendments to the union s by-laws. This inactivity will continue as long as the minimum quorum of members required for it to become active again is not achieved and the union is not formally dissolved by a competent court. The Government states, however, that, Mr. Aquiles Mercado terminated his employment with the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region (ESVAL S.A.), and both parties were entirely satisfied with the settlement which they signed.
.The Committee takes note of all the Government s observations. It requests the Government to communicate the text of the final ruling given concerning the dismissal of the trade union official, Mr. Yapur Ruiz, and again requests the Government to take all measures in its power to ensure that he is reinstated until such time as a decision is given on the latest legal action after the successive judicial decisions ordering his reinstatement. The Committee deplores the delay that has occurred in the proceedings.
.As regards the allegations concerning the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region (ESVAL S.A.), the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that the union is currently inactive for want of the legal minimum membership, and that the union s president, Mr. Aquiles Mercado, signed an agreement terminating his employment. Under these conditions, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the case.
.The Committee examined this case at its May-June  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see st Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )].
.The Government sent new observations in communications dated  January and  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its May-June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see st Report, para. ]:(a) In the circumstances of this case, the Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that Mr. Yapur Ruz is reinstated in his place of work at least until the appeals lodged in this case are decided by the court. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b) As regards the serious allegations concerning the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region, ESVAL S.A., the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not communicated its observations in this respect and requests it to send them without delay in order to examine these allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In its communications of  January and  February , the Government refers to the situation concerning the dismissal of the trade union official Erick Dusan Yapur Ruz, director of trade union No.  of the Pedro Pablo Castillo public transport company. The Government points out that, on  May , a complaint alleging anti-union activities by the employer was brought before the First Labour Court of San Miguel, Case No. ?. The Court handed down a ruling on  June , finding the employer guilty of the aforementioned activities and imposing a fine of  UT (payment units) ( UT = US$). The defendant lodged an appeal and submitted an application for judicial review for error of form. The Labour Directorate in turn lodged an appeal for review. The Supreme Court automatically quashed the final ruling because essential evidential procedures had been omitted. The court of first instance (First Labour Court) consequently brought the case back to the preliminary hearing stage. On  March , the Labour Court ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union official, cautioning the employer that any failure to comply with the court order would result in detention. On  May  the company lodged an appeal for preventive constitutional protection (amparo). The Court of Appeal rejected this appeal but replaced the threat of detention with a fine of  UTM (monthly payment unit). On  August  a final ruling was handed down, finding the defendant guilty of anti-union activities and imposing a fine of  UTM, ordering the immediate reinstatement of the trade union official Mr. Yapur Ruz and ordering the defendant to pay the costs of the case. On  August  the defendant lodged an appeal and submitted an application for judicial review for error of form to the Court of Appeal. On  September , the Court declared the application for judicial review to be inadmissible and, as regards the appeal, declared that proceedings relating to this matter were before the San Miguel Court of Appeal. This appeal is still pending and has been neither pleaded nor settled up to the date of the report supplied by the Labour Directorate in Case No.  of  November .
.With regard to the situation of ESVAL, and in particular with respect to Mr. Aquiles Mercado, president of one of the enterprise trade unions, the Government declares that, on  April , a former member of the trade union (of two members who had that status) brought a complaint (Case No. -) before the Regional Electoral Tribunal of the Vth Region concerning the leadership elections held on  March , in which Mr. Aquiles Mercado, the only member of the union at the time, was elected. The Electoral Tribunal decided, in accordance with a ruling of  October , to annul that election, also declaring that a new election could not be held, since the trade union did not achieve the quorum laid down in article  of the Labour Code. That ruling was the subject of an appeal for reversal (the only admissible form of appeal) by Mr. Aquiles Mercado. Up to the date of the report supplied by the Labour Directorate in Case No.  of  November , that appeal has not been settled. Article  of the Labour Code lays down the following provisions:Article . In order to form a trade union in an enterprise which has more than fifty workers, a minimum of twenty-five workers representing at least ten per cent of the total of those who provide services in the said enterprise shall be required.Notwithstanding the above, in order to form a trade union in enterprises in which no trade union already exists, at least eight workers shall be required, and the quorum required in the previous subparagraph must be achieved within a period of not more than one year, on expiry of which the legal personality of the union shall statutorily cease to exist, should that requirement fail to be met.If the enterprise has fifty workers or less, a trade union may be formed by eight of those workers.If the enterprise has more than one establishment, the workers belonging to each establishment may also form a trade union, with a minimum of twenty-five workers representing at least thirty per cent of",-1,2002,Chile
144,"the workers of that establishment.Notwithstanding the above, whatever the percentage that they represent, a trade union may be formed by two hundred and fifty or more workers of the same enterprise.
.In conclusion, the Government points out that the problem relating to Mr. Aquiles Mercado, according to information from the Labour Directorate, is that he elected himself president of a trade union which has only one member: himself. In this case there is no violation of freedom of association.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the dismissal of the trade union official, Mr. Erick Dusan Yapur Ruz, the Committee had noted in its previous examination of the case that the Government had informed it that he had been dismissed illegally in  (as had been verified by the labour inspectorate) and that the court of first instance and the appeal court had ordered his reinstatement and imposed a heavy fine on the Pedro Pablo Castillo company [see st Report, para. ].
.The Committee notes the new statements by the Government to the effect that, after various appeals, on  March and  August , the judicial authority again ordered on two occasions (the last of these via a final ruling) the reinstatement of the aforementioned trade union official and imposed fresh sanctions on the company, which continued to appeal.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee deplores the delay in this case and reiterates the conclusions that it formulated at its May-June  meeting [see st Report, paras.  and ]:The Committee recalls that the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, para. ).
.In view of the circumstances of this case, the Committee once again requests the Government to adopt measures to ensure that Mr. Yapur Ruz is reinstated in his post at least until the last appeal brought before the courts is settled. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region (ESVAL S.A.), the Committee recalls that the complainant organization had alleged that serious incidents had occurred against that union, especially against Mr. Aquiles Mercado, the president of the union, and other officials of the union, and that the union had been the subject of pressure and harassment from the company since ; according to the complainant organization, since the trade union firmly opposed the privatization of the company, attempts were made to suborn the staff by means of threats and dismissals; officials' work equipment (telephones, computers) was illegally confiscated; they were prohibited from performing their duties and payments of their wages were delayed in order to intimidate them and make them leave the union [see st Report, para. ].
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that, on  October , the judicial authority annulled the  March  election of Mr. Aquiles Mercado as president of the trade union since the union had just one member (Mr. Aquiles Mercado himself), and that under these circumstances article  of the Labour Code concerning the minimum number of workers for forming a trade union was not respected. The Committee notes the fact that Mr. Aquiles Mercado lodged an appeal for reversal which has still not been settled.
.The Committee nevertheless wishes to emphasize the fact that the complaint was submitted by the complainant organization in November  and therefore predates the unusual elections referred to by the Government. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations and keep it informed of its result.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In view of the circumstances of this case, the Committee once again requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the trade union official, Mr. Yapur Ruz, is reinstated in his post at least until the last appeal brought before the courts is settled and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region, (ESVAL S.A.), the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation in this respect and keep it informed of its result.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Latin American Workers' Confederation (CLAT) of August and November .
.The Government sent its partial observations in a letter dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of August , the Latin American Workers' Confederation (CLAT) alleges the anti-union dismissal of Erick Dusan Yapur Ruz who had worked as a driver in the Pedro Pablo Castillo Castillo collective haulage and transport company since  and was director of trade union No.  of the company. The complainant organization indicates that although on  June , the First Labour Court in San Miguel ordered his reinstatement in his normal work, up to the time of the submission of the complaint, Mr. Yapur Ruz had not been reinstated nor paid the corresponding remuneration. This situation persists despite pressure exercised by the National Confederation of Transport and Related Workers in Chile (CONATRATCH) on the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications and the presence of inspectors in the workplace, who reported that Mr. Yapur Ruz was denied access to the company s premises. The complainant organization maintains that this kind of dismissal is an attack on the right to work and freedom of association and finally requests that Mr. Yapur Ruz be reinstated in his post.
.In addition, in its communication of November , the complainant organization alleges that according to information received from the Autonomous Confederation of Workers of Chile (CAT), serious incidents occurred against the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region, ESVAL S.A., in particular against Mr. Aquiles Mercado, president of the union and other union officials. According to the complainant organization, the trade union has been subject to pressure and harassment by the company since , when it was discovered that financial resources had been squandered, which seriously affected the capital, remuneration and legal shares in the company s profits. The trade union firmly opposed the privatization of the company and because of this stand attempts were made to suborn the personnel by threats and dismissals which succeeded in frightening the members of the trade union. Many of them, however, refused to be suborned. In addition, the officials' office equipment (telephone, computer) was illegally confiscated, they were prohibited from performing their functions and payment of their remuneration was delayed in order to frighten them and make them leave the union. The complainant organization adds that this attitude is unacceptable and reports that the company s majority shareholder is the British transnational corporation, Anglian Water Group.
.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that Mr. Erick Yapur Ruz is the president of trade union No. of the company concerned and director of the National Confederation of Company and Inter-company Federations and Trade Unions of Land Transport and Related Workers of Chile (CONATRATCH). The Government states that on  October , Mr. Yapur Ruz was unlawfully dismissed, a fact verified and sanctioned by the competent labour inspectorate. Subsequently, the unit for the Defence of Freedom of Association of the Metropolitan Regional Labour Directorate prepared a judicial complaint of anti-union practices by the employer which was submitted to the San Miguel Court of Appeal. The Labour Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr. Yapur Ruz on  June  but this was not possible because Mr. Yapur Ruz did not turn up. His reinstatement finally took place on  June, immediately after which the Regional Labour Directorate as plaintiff added the reinstatement order to the records of the case. On  June, the court handed down a judgement in which it found the enterprise Pedro Pablo Castillo Castillo guilty of anti-union practices, namely the unlawful dismissal of a worker with trade union immunity and imposed a fine and the costs of the trial. Given that at the time when the judgement was handed down, the reinstatement had already taken place, the court did not rule on that aspect. The employer entered an appeal and application for annulment and the hearing of the case is at present pending.
.The Government states that on  July  the enterprise Pedro Pablo Castillo Castillo, having been notified of the matter, again dismissed Mr. Yapur Ruz on the grounds that he was awaiting the result of the appeal. The employer was fined heavily for failing to comply with the reinstatement order and failure to pay in full the remuneration owed to the trade union official.
.As regards the alleged anti-union dismissal of",-1,2002,Chile
145,"Mr. Erick Dusan Yapur Ruz, a driver in the Pedro Pablo Castillo Castillo collective haulage and transport company and director of trade union No.  of the company, the Committee observes that although the official was reinstated for a time in June , at the time when the complaint was submitted, he was no longer in his post and had not been paid the related remuneration and, according to inspectors who visited the workplace, the official had been denied access to the company s premises.
.The Committee observes that the Government confirms the facts indicated by the complainant that: Mr. Eric Yapur Ruz is the president of trade union No.  of the company; he was unlawfully dismissed; and that at present he is still not in his post. The Committee also observes that the Government states that: () the matter was verified and sanctioned by the competent labour inspectorate; () the unit for the Defence of Freedom of Association of the Metropolitan Regional Labour Directorate submitted a judicial complaint of anti-union practices by the employer; () the Labour Court ordered his reinstatement which could not take place on the date envisaged because Mr. Yapur Ruz did not turn up; () the reinstatement finally took place and immediately thereafter the Regional Labour Directorate added the reinstatement order to the records of the case; () the court found the enterprise Pedro Pablo Castillo Castillo guilty of anti-union practices consisting of the unlawful dismissal of a worker with trade union immunity and imposed a fine and the costs of the trial; () the ruling did not mention reinstatement since at the time, reinstatement had already taken place; () the ruling was appealed by the employer and the hearing of the case is now pending; () on  July , the enterprise Pedro Pablo Castillo Castillo, having been notified of the ruling, again dismissed Mr. Yapur Ruz from his functions on the grounds that he was awaiting the result of the appeal; and () the employer was heavily fined for failure to comply with the reinstatement order and pay in full the remuneration owed to Mr. Yapur Ruz.
.The Committee recalls that the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, para. ]. In the circumstances of this case, the Committee requests the Government to adopt measures to ensure that Mr. Yapur Ruz is reinstated in his place of work at least until the appeal and application for annulment are decided by the court. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.The Committee also observes that the complainant organization alleges that serious incidents occurred against the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region, ESVAL S.A., in particular against Mr. Aquiles Mercado, president of the union and other union officials, and that the trade union has been subject to pressure and harassment by the company since . According to the complainant organization, as the trade union firmly opposed the privatization of the company; attempts were made to suborn the personnel by threats and dismissals; the officials' office equipment (telephone, computer) was illegally confiscated; and they were prohibited from performing their functions and payment of their remuneration was delayed in order to frighten them and make them leave the union. The Committee notes with regret that the Government has not communicated its observations in this respect and requests it to send them without delay in order to examine these allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In the circumstances of this case, the Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that Mr. Yapur Ruz is reinstated in his place of work at least until the appeals lodged in this case are decided by the court. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.(b) As regards the serious allegations concerning the Trade Union of the Sanitation Works Company of the Vth Region, ESVAL S.A., the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not communicated its observations in this respect and requests it to send them without delay in order to examine these allegations in full knowledge of the facts.",-1,2002,Chile
146,".At its meeting in November , the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the decision handed down with regard to the dismissal of seven unionized pilots from the Lan Chile enterprise [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communications dated  April  and  January , the Government states that there are currently two lawsuits relating to the dismissal of Lan Chile pilots. The latter (lawsuit No. -, brought before the Fifth Labour Court of Santiago) has been ruled upon and the complaint has been rejected by the Labour Tribunal. As to the action brought before the Sixth Labour Court of Santiago by the Labour Directorate with regard to anti-union practices (lawsuit No. -), a ruling was handed down in first instance in favour of the complainant. While the ruling was under appeal, the parties reached an agreement out of court, as a result of which the Appeals Court of Santiago revoked the ruling in first instance.
.The Committee notes the extrajudicial agreement between the parties with respect to the dismissal of the pilots, and the decision of the judicial authority concerning the dismissal of one of the pilots in which his complaint was rejected.
.At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the decision handed down with regard to the dismissal of seven pilots and to keep it informed of the result of the judicial proceedings for anti-union practices filed against Lan Chile S.A. by a former member of the union [see rd Report, para. ].
.In its communication dated  April , the Government states that the court of first instance rejected the motion for anti-union practices on the basis of prescription and because the former member who had made the claim did not have the legal interest. Also, the court fined the enterprise (  unidades tributarias'  for not having fully discounted the union dues; this ruling was confirmed by the Court of Appeal of Santiago.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee again requests the Government to inform it of the decision handed down with regard to the dismissal of seven unionized pilots from the Lan Chile enterprise.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting and adopted an interim report [see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )].
.The Government sent, on  May , the comments, dated February , of the Confederation of Production and Trade, and provided additional observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its November  meeting, the Committee noted the Government s statements [see th Report, para. ], which confirmed that:' the action entitled  work-to-rule' taken by the trade union consisted in fulfilling the provisions of aeronautical regulations to the letter, which obviously did not involve the infringement of applicable standards; no contractual or legal standards were violated;' between  September and  October , the enterprise dismissed  trade union members. In  of these cases, the enterprise invoked  company requirements' and in cases it involved a  serious breach of contractual obligations'  However, in these  cases, there is a clear relationship between the delays and the breaches in contractual obligations (or internal regulations). Following the dismissal of these  workers, the company reinstated  and amongst those not reinstated were eight former trade union directors and workers who participated in the  legal strike. Therefore, the measure was highly discriminatory given that, in essence, it affected the most active members of the organization, namely those who were dismissed for respecting a trade union agreement consisting in  work-to-rule'  without violating contractual or legal standards. Three of the five members of the trade union executive board left the company following legal proceedings (which lead to an agreement or out-of-court negotiations). Thirty?seven pilots affected filed a request to vacate the dismissals before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago;' the dismissals reduced the negotiating power of the workers (participants decreased by  per cent compared with the previous collective bargaining process) and while the enterprise signed a new collective agreement, it also came to an agreement with three groups of pilots that had formed part of the trade union. The collective agreement with the trade union was for four years ( months) with a  per cent reduction in the pay increase that otherwise would have been due, whereas the collective agreements with the groups of workers were for  months and a lower pay adjustment. Therefore, the pilots will not be able to bargain collectively at the same time and a strike will be very difficult to sustain in this context;' it has been established that unionized pilots and technicians were subjected to intense pressure aimed at making them withdraw trade union membership. This is shown in documents and communications issued by the employer which offer improved conditions of work that are incompatible with continued trade union membership. This approach was also reflected in the explicit threats of dismissal that were made by some supervisors and acknowledged by some workers during conversations with the officer from the Labour Inspectorate. The trade union can legally file a complaint before the courts for these events and have the company fined;' according to the inspections conducted within the enterprise, the latter excluded trade union members from flight training for operating new company aeroplanes;' forty pilots dismissed for having participated in the  work-to-rule' action were reinstated with the condition that they write a letter in which they had to acknowledge responsibility for the possible damage the industrial action may have caused, as well as blame the trade union for forcing them into the alleged transgression. In their new individual contracts, these pilots did not regain the collective benefits that they had previously enjoyed;' the administrative authority fined the enterprise on two occasions for failing to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contract or for failing to provide four trade union officials with their work schedules (to keep their licence, pilots must be accredited with a specific number of flight hours, and the inability to do so amounts, in practice, to professional disqualification).
.The Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee decided to present an interim report on this case, considering that information was lacking. In particular, the Committee requests the Government to solicit information from the employers' organizations concerned, with a view to having at its disposal their views, as well as those of the enterprise concerned, on the questions at issue. The Committee will then re-examine this case.(b) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations which have been confirmed by the Government, and expresses its deep concern in view of the number, and nature, of the anti-union practices that were discriminatory or contrary to collective bargaining and resulted in trade union membership dropping from  to .(c) As regards the allegations relating to acts of anti-union discrimination (mass dismissals for conducting trade union activities, pressure exerted on pilots and their family members so that the former withdrew their trade union membership, the exclusion of trade union members from flight training for operating new aeroplanes, the failure to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contracts of trade union officials, the reinstatement of more than half of those dismissed under anti-union conditions), the Committee deeply deplores these anti-union practices and highlights the importance that the discriminatory practices suffered by the complainant organization and its members be rectified and sanctioned without delay.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of legal proceedings that are currently in force or that will intervene by reason of the previously mentioned anti-union dismissals and practices, and expects that effective and dissuasive sanctions, along with compensatory measures, will be imposed without delay in order to put a stop to the enterprise s anti union practices in the future. The Committee requests the Government to initiate discussions with a view to the possible reinstatement of the  pilots who have taken legal action against their dismissal.(e) As regards the complainant s allegations and the Government s statement that the enterprise bargained with individual pilots or with groups of pilots for anti-union purposes, and in order to prevent pilots from bargaining collectively in a simultaneous manner in the future, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to prevent Lan Chile S.A. from bargaining for anti-union purposes with individual pilots or non-unionized groups of pilots, and to keep it informed of legal action that may be initiated with regard to such practices.
.The Confederation of Production and Trade (CPC) states that the Government, unfairly, neither informed nor consulted Lan Chile S.A. with regard to the present complaint before the Committee on Freedom of Association. It was a cause for surprise that the Government, acting outside its",-1,2002,Chile
147,"legal powers, spoke unilaterally and arbitrarily of  anti?union practices' at Lan Chile S.A.; this is a serious infringement of the legislation as notice and decision on infringements through alleged unfair practices or anti-union practices are exclusively the domain of the labour courts (article  of the Labour Code). Moreover, the Labour Inspectorate is responsible for lodging complaints of such practices with the courts, but it did not do so and neither did the trade union; there is only one complaint lodged with the legal authorities relating to establishing whether the dismissal of certain workers was null and void based on the alleged anti-union practices. The CPC indicates, furthermore, that the Government has added other new facts to the complaint by the complainant organization.
.The CPC indicates, with regard to the complaint and the dismissal of pilots, that between  August and  September  there was an average increase of operating flight time of planes of  hours (. per cent more than the standard operating flight time).
.Flight delays caused disruptions in flight traffic control at the airport of Santiago de Chile (frequent changes in the planning of arrivals, alterations in approach sequences, integration of other users in holding patterns, etc.) and passengers missed connections, enduring long waits and, at times, flights were cancelled.
.Other deliberate actions were to fly at altitudes below those recommended in order to use more fuel. Moreover, the average of medical leave increased from .- daily to  daily, which forced the company to cancel flights when replacement alternatives were not sufficient.
.The dismissals occurred for these reasons and to stop the damage that was wrongfully being caused and not because the process of collective bargaining was drawing near or because of the trade union membership of the pilots. In fact, following the dismissals, there was a trade union meeting during which it was agreed to suspend the actions undertaken in order to meet with the management of the company, achieving in the meetings with the latter complete agreement with regard to the collective bargaining under way, which was negotiated specifically with the same trade union officials who are the complainants in this case, culminating in the signing of a collective agreement with the trade union organization on  November .
.The dismissals were a result of the  serious failure to fulfil the obligations imposed by the employment contract' (article . of the Labour Code) and, specifically, the behaviour of those dismissed was inconsistent with the technical standards of their duties and led to considerable damage to the company and its clients, both on the operational level, such as its commercial image (destroying the work of years) and on the economic level. They also seriously infringed the internal regulations of the company.
.Lan Chile S.A. was the number one company in the One World Alliance on international routes and number two for domestic routes. However, with the strategy promoted by a group of pilots ( go-slow' , the company was ranked last in the punctuality statistics for the period  August to  September ; the averages indicate a fall from . per cent to . per cent on domestic routes and from . per cent to . per cent on international routes. The measures used were a series of deliberate and concerted actions of unwarranted delays in flights, to the point which the General Directorate for Civil Aviation issued a resolution prohibiting unwarranted delays. These actions included a longer time to authorize closing the plane doors, longer  delays' on the tarmac both before departure and on arrival, the misuse of medical leave and flying at altitudes lower than usual, as well as other clearly obstructive actions. Once the dismissals had been declared by the company, the parameters of these issues returned to normal.
.Those dismissed, moreover, infringed the contractual obligations of the duties of fidelity and loyalty.
.Up to February , one-third of the  workers (i.e. ) who filed legal complaints against the enterprise for unfair dismissal renounced their complaints, having arrived at an agreement with the enterprise and ending the dispute that they had with it.
.Lan Chile S.A. totally rejects any  pressure' on pilots and technicians to withdraw their trade union membership; the Government has not specified what this pressure was, and it is completely and absolutely untrue. A large majority of the workers are members of trade unions without having problems as a result of this and the company maintains normal relationships with these trade unions. Company policy fully respects trade union and labour rights. It is also completely untrue that the company has pressured the families of the pilots so that they withdraw their trade union membership. However, many members of the pilots' trade union believed that the  go-slow' was unnecessary and out of proportion, above all taking into account that it coincided with the tragic events of  September , and they freely chose to withdraw their trade union membership from the pilots' trade union without any interference from the company. There have been no complaints lodged with the courts with regard to the alleged pressures noted by the Government of Chile, in spite of the fact that the legislation envisages serious penalties when trade union membership is hindered.
.The Government s statement that it noted that the company excluded pilots and co-pilots belonging to the complainant organization from flight training for operating the new company aeroplanes is completely untrue (documentation attesting that all pilots have received the regulation training and advanced courses is attached). For example, during the period stated, three trade union members obtained their promotion as pilots of the Airbus .
.It is not true that the dismissals reduced the negotiating power of the workers or that collective bargaining was fragmented and gave rise to lesser benefits than those previously obtained. On the contrary, in spite of the fact that the pilots were bargaining during the greatest commercial aviation crisis in history and in the context of the serious economic situation of a neighbouring country ' Argentina (which had losses of US$ million in the fourth trimester of ) ' the pilots not only did not suffer a reduction in benefits and remuneration but an increase according to the change in the consumer price index was agreed on, as well as a real increase in wages equivalent to  per cent per year.
.According to the Government, three groups of workers, bargaining separately, signed collective agreements for  months, in circumstances in which the trade union did so for  months, for which reason, in future negotiations, there will be some pilots who will not be able to negotiate collectively through the regulated channels and at the same time, and who will not have a negotiating power that can act as an appropriate counterbalance. In the complaint and in the information provided by the Government of Chile, it states that the periods agreed by each one of the contracts and the collective agreements ensure that the pilots will not be able, in practice, to come together to bargain collectively in the regulated manner or at the same time, and that they will not be able to negotiate with their counterpart on an equal footing. This is incorrect.
.First, Lan Chile S.A. states that the various collective agreements and contracts were freely signed by the contracting parties, who acted in full autonomy. The representatives of the pilots and co-pilots established, together with the company, the duration of the various collective agreements that bound them, which not only ensure their current level of income for a prolonged period of time when the civil aviation market is very unstable but also increase it in real terms throughout the whole period. The duration agreed upon will clearly benefit the workers affected by these instruments and will impose quite a serious situation of inflexibility on the company, as it will not be able to try to reduce the cost of the wages covered by these instruments as they are protected by legal regulations that prevent individual bargaining for wages established in collective instruments.
.Second, it should be highlighted that the collective agreement signed by the company and the complainant organization dates from  November , i.e. after the main collective labour agreements whose durations are being contested.
.In the case of Lan Chile S.A., pilots and co-pilots are always able to unite, when they consider it most convenient, and bargain collectively or separately, at the time of expiry of the last of the collective contracts or agreements, or before, if the company will accept such a procedure. However, there is no one absolute obstacle that makes it impossible for all workers employed as pilots or co-pilots of Lan Chile S.A. to associate in one single draft collective agreement should they wish to do so.
.While the Government s information may imply, from its own particular point of view, that the periods agreed upon in the collective agreements and contracts are prejudicial to the pilots and co-pilots of Lan Chile S.A., the reality is that these employees themselves chose periods longer",-1,2002,Chile
148,"than those agreed upon, and in doing so believed that this would benefit them.
.With regard to the alleged publicity campaign undertaken by Lan Chile S.A. against the complainant organization, its officials and members, Lan Chile S.A. does not know of the existence of any type of publicity campaign against the trade union, its officials or members, which is referred to in the complaint submitted by the trade union, either in form or in substance. Similarly, Lan Chile S.A. categorically states that it has not financed, either directly or indirectly, notices, publications, press studies or other forms of publicity aimed at damaging or influencing the image of the company s trade unions.
.Moreover, the pilots and co-pilots are the public image of the company for its clients and the highest authority in the company s planes and the company has an interest in maintaining their prestige and repute, and there is no reflection in the media of any doubt in their professional capacity, which the company believes is of the highest standard and quality.
.Lan Chile S.A. indicated that it was proud of its pilots, their professional capacity and their dexterity, and it would be simply irrational to begin a campaign, from within the company, to undermine them, given that this would directly affect the company, which, as an aviation company, must, among other things, guarantee the appropriate competence of the pilots and co-pilots in the cockpits of its various planes.
.Logically, not all the press articles were pleasing to or supportive of the parties mentioned, but to proceed from there to maintain that the company organized and financed a campaign of this type is a very different state of affairs. Lan Chile S.A. quotes, with press cuttings, a series of statements by the secretary of the pilots' trade union that are clearly critical of and prejudicial to the company and that are not based on fact. It is possible that many things were said that could have and should have been omitted by the parties in an atmosphere as tense as the  go-slow' protest, but it is neither fair nor true to maintain that there was  a campaign by Lan Chile S.A. to discredit the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians of Lan Chile' 
.The Government s report indicates that  of the pilots dismissed for disciplinary reasons were reinstated by the employer on the condition that they write a letter in which they acknowledged responsibility for the possible damage the industrial action may have caused, and blaming the trade union for forcing them into the alleged transgression. Moreover, it states that the pilots, in their new individual contracts, did not regain the collective benefits that they had previously enjoyed. With regard to this issue, the Lan Chile S.A. company finally reinstated  pilots at Lan Chile, Lan Cargo (formerly Ladeco) and Lan Express. The labour and remuneration benefits that these workers enjoy are identical in all cases to those pertaining to the rest of the pilot body at Lan Chile S.A., for which reason it is untrue that they have been discriminated against in this matter. The exception to the above is of four cases of pilots who were employed on a temporary basis with temporary contracts and various wage levels.
.With regard to the alleged written statement requested by the company, wherein the former employees were required, in order to be re-employed,  to acknowledge responsibility for the possible damage the industrial action may have caused, and blaming the trade union for forcing them into the alleged transgression' is not true.
.While many of the dismissed pilots and co-pilots requested the company in writing that they be reinstated, the tone and content of these letters was that believed relevant by each individual, and the company made no demands in this respect. It is difficult moreover to see how the demand to request reinstatement from the company in a letter might affect freedom of association and the rights of workers in any way, particularly when these letters have no effect other than to facilitate reinstatement with the company. Moreover, these letters were never made public.
.The report indicates that Lan Chile S.A. has made various threats of dismissal to pilots of the company. Lan Chile S.A. does not know of any of the alleged threats of dismissal to its workers that are referred to in the complaint from the trade union. It is not aware of the causes that may have given rise to them nor to whom specifically they were directed or who specifically threatened dismissal to a pilot of Lan Chile S.A. None of this information was supplied by the Government, which says that it confirms these threats. It should be pointed out that the complaint, illogically, states that the company at the same time is  in desperate need of pilots' and is making  an effort to ensure adequate staffing levels during the next period of heavy air traffic' 
.If, as the complainant organization states, the number of trade union members has gone from  to , it should be emphasized that the actions decided upon by the executive board of the trade union caused a deep sense of unease and concern among many members who believed that the trade union measures were unjustified and disproportionate, particularly in the context of the events of  September . The company did not encourage members to withdraw their membership. Moreover, the fact that the executive board of the trade union went from five to three members is due to the trade union s decision.
.In three cases, the officials themselves requested their disassociation from the company, indicating that their situation with the members was untenable and their representativeness was minimal, for which reasons they preferred to relinquish their trade union duties.
.With regard to the decrease in the membership of the trade union and a significant reduction in resources, in the form of trade union dues, the company has nothing to do with the resources of the trade union.
.In its communication of  January , the Government transmits the following information, provided by Lan Chile S.A.:  of the  workers who had filed proceedings against the dismissals of September  have signed a direct agreement with the company whereby they withdrew unilaterally from their demands; the only cases remaining pending concern seven workers. The withdrawals (which the Government annexes to its communication) mention that  in its employer s capacity, during all the working relationship binding the undersigned, Lan Chile maintained an appropriate conduct, showed respect and complied with labour standards  ?
.Referring to the anti-union practices allegedly committed by Lan Chile S.A., the Government adds that on  September , a former member of the union filed charges of anti-union practices which are dealt with by the th Chamber of the Labour jurisdiction; the latter has requested information from the Metropolitan Regional Directorate of Labour and has concluded that this Directorate should be made a party to said proceedings, under article  of the Labour Code. At the hearing on  October , the company raised the time limit provided for in article  of the Code of Civil Procedure, and argued that the court was already seized with the issue, in the context of the case relating to the dismissal of the pilots.
.Finally, as regards the collective bargaining conducted by Lan Chile S.A. with individual pilots or small groups of pilots, to impede bargaining with the whole group of workers, the Government indicates that the company has been firmly advised that the labour authorities would not permit anti-union actions and that the penalties provided for in the law for such actions would be applied.
.In the present case the complainant organization mainly alleges a campaign organized by Lan Chile S.A. to break up its organization, which began in  and took the form of a series of illegal practices of anti-union discrimination, above all in connection with negotiations aimed at concluding a new collective agreement. According to the complainant, these practices include a publicity campaign against the trade union; the mass dismissal of unionized pilots; threats of dismissal; pressure exerted on pilots and their family members so that the former withdrew trade union membership; discrimination against trade union members with regard to training; the re-employment of dismissed pilots under anti-union conditions (the acceptance of individual responsibility for the industrial action entitled  work-to-rule'  a written statement that the trade union ordered them to participate in this action; and acceptance to be covered by individual employment contracts rather than the collective agreement).
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Confederation of Production and Trade (CPC) wherein the Lan Chile S.A. company s point of view is presented and the allegations of the complainant organization concerning a series of illegal labour practices violating trade union rights and the Government s statements attributing Lan Chile S.A. with anti-union practices are rejected. According to the company, the complainant organization instituted a series of deliberate and concerted actions by the pilots prior to collective bargaining",-1,2002,Chile
149,"in order to harm the company; the information provided by the CPC points to a combination of  work-to-rule' and  go-slow' activities and deliberate delays to flights, a large number of medical leave certificates and measures to increase costs (flying at altitudes lower than those recommended), which caused economic damage, damage to the image of the company and adversely affected clients at the same time as it caused disturbances in air traffic control, according to the company. In order to put an end to this situation, the company proceeded with dismissals. According to the CPC, a new collective agreement was signed on  November  and only  of the pilots who had been dismissed were continuing with proceedings against the company for their dismissal in September and October . The Committee notes the contradiction between the points of view of Lan Chile S.A. and the Government with regard to the existence of anti-union practices, but observes that according to the Government, in September , a former member of the union has filed charges of anti-union practices with the judicial authorities, which have decided that the Metropolitan Regional Directorate of Labour should be made a party to said proceedings. The Committee also notes the recent Government s statement that  of the  workers who had filed proceedings against their dismissals have withdrawn their demands, have declared that the company had maintained throughout that period an appropriate conduct, in conformity with the law, and that there remain only seven pending cases.
.In the circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the decision that is handed down with regard to the dismissal of the seven pilots and to keep it informed of the results of the judicial charges brought for anti-union practices by an ex-member of the union.
.Independently of the decision to be made by the courts on the alleged anti-union practices, the Committee emphasizes that in this case the initial number of dismissals extended to  pilots who were members of the trade union, even though, a little later, the company reinstated a large number of these and was reaching agreements with others, so that only seven cases of dismissal remain pending before the courts at present.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government indicates, in connection with the collective bargaining conducted by Lan Chile S.A. with individual pilots or small groups of pilots, to impede bargaining with the whole group of workers, that the company has been firmly advised that the labour authorities would not permit anti-union actions and that the penalties provided for in the law for such actions would be applied. The Committee recalls that measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the decision that is handed down with regard to the dismissal of the seven pilots and to keep it informed of the result of the judicial proceedings for anti-union practices filed against Lan Chile S.A. by an ex-member of the union.
.The complaint is set out in a communication from the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians of Lan Chile (SPTLC) dated  January . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  July .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians of Lan Chile S.A. makes allegations concerning a series of illegal labour practices contrary to Conventions Nos.  and  in connection with negotiations aimed at concluding a new collective agreement. The complainant organization explains that in , Chile witnessed an intense labour dispute between the trade union and Lan Chile S.A., which is the country s largest commercial air transport company. Before contractual negotiations began on  October , when the parties were legally obliged to maintain the status quo, the company started a fierce and very publicized campaign against the trade union. Consequently, the trade union reacted by taking industrial action, which included  work-to-rule'  in an attempt to counteract the practices used against it. As a result of the campaign carried out by the company, in both the place of work and the press, the trade union has lost over  per cent of its members in recent months.
.Initially, the company tried to rid itself of unionized pilots by transferring them to recently created subsidiary enterprises. The company achieved this by negotiating directly with trade union members and promising them fast-track promotion in these subsidiaries provided they withdrew trade union membership. Between May and September , the company managed to transfer collective work units to subsidiaries or enterprises abroad, although at significantly higher operational costs.
.The company subsequently dismissed various pilots, all of whom were active members of the trade union. On  September , the company dismissed  unionized pilots, supposedly for  disciplinary' reasons. In particular, the company dismissed all pilots who attended a speech given that month by John Darrah, President of the Allied Pilots Association. Another  pilots and trade union members were later dismissed for disciplinary reasons between  and  October. At the same time,  pilots were dismissed owing to a reduction in the workforce. Many of the pilots dismissed days before the collective bargaining process began were very active members of the trade union; eight of these pilots were former directors of the trade union.
.The management then launched a final assault on the remaining members and, both directly and indirectly, threatened them with dismissal. For example, various supervisors telephoned the wives or other family members of pilots to threaten and intimidate them into exerting pressure on their husbands to withdraw trade union membership and sign individual contracts with the company. Furthermore, the company called upon the services of non-unionized pilots to circulate rumours that key members of the trade union had withdrawn their membership or cooperated with the company. This effort led more than  members to withdraw trade union membership.
.Discrimination against the trade union can be seen to a greater extent in the company s refusal to honour seniority with regard to flight training for new aeroplanes. Pilots are usually trained to operate new aeroplanes in order of seniority. However, following the trade union s industrial action  work-to-rule'  all flight training was cancelled. When the school was later re-opened, the company excluded all trade union members, independently of their seniority, from participating in flight training. The trade union presented this complaint to the company, but no action has been taken.
.In view of the loss of so many pilots, the company was, and is still, in desperate need of pilots. Since the company does not wish to ease the pressure exerted on the trade union, it is contracting non-unionized pilots from Peru or Ecuador, amongst other countries, and in many cases to the full knowledge, and with the consent, of the Civil Aviation Authorities (DGAC) and the Government of Chile.
.Lan Chile is starting to offer dismissed pilots with reinstatement in an effort to ensure adequate staffing levels during the next period of heavy air traffic. However, reinstatement comes at a very high cost. Former trade union pilots wishing to return must write a letter by their own hand in which they accept individual responsibility for any damage that may have been caused during the industrial action,  work-to-rule' and state that the trade union told them to participate in this action. When a pilot is reemployed by the company, or one of the subsidiaries, he is not covered by the existing collective agreement but by an individual employment contract.
.To date, nearly  of the  trade union members no longer work for the company or were pressurized in withdrawing their membership, or persuaded to do so; the number of members went from  to . Furthermore, the company initiated legal action for harassment against one of the directors of the trade union just before negotiations began. A company representative announced a second case of legal action, but this has still not been presented. The pilots dismissed illegally have initiated legal proceedings against the company demanding their reinstatement. It is estimated that a decision on this issue will take more than two years.
.The complainant organization points out that the reported events describe a campaign aimed at breaking up the trade union.
.In its communication of  July , the Government explains that during the second semester of , in the months prior to the expiry of the collective agreement for pilots and technicians, a climate began",-1,2002,Chile
150,"to develop that was hardly suitable for the negotiations planned for October of that year between Lan Chile S.A. and the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians of Lan Chile S.A. It should be noted that this situation developed following the attack and destruction of the Twin Towers in the United States, and that this incident obviously had an effect on some of the events denounced by the trade union, but does not provide a single or sufficient explanation.
.The Government then lists a series of events which, as it points out, constitute anti-union practices.Individual bargaining between the enterprise and pilots
.During the second quarter of , the enterprise created subsidiary enterprises to which some unionized pilots were transferred following individual bargaining, which provided them with access to improved financial conditions, and their withdrawal of trade union membership. This process was public knowledge and was even encouraged by company executives.Publicity campaign against collective bargaining
.The atmosphere being experienced within Lan Chile S.A. was made known to the public through articles in the press that appeared repeatedly from August  onwards. These articles pointed out that the collective bargaining process to be carried out by the pilots was a threat to the entreprise and to the country s economy given that the bargaining appeared to be intrinsically linked to conflicts and paralysis. These conclusions stem from articles that appeared in the  El Mercurio' newspaper during August .
.In a public notice, the trade union s executive board qualified these articles in the press as a campaign against the trade union in order to discredit the workers' organization and discourage collective bargaining by generating a negative public opinion. The trade union responded by implementing the industrial action entitled  work-to-rule'  consisting in fulfilling the provisions of aeronautical regulations to the letter. This obviously involved the non-infringement of applicable standards, but also involved straying from the usual practices employed by the enterprise in air navigation processes, and which are outside the regulations, in order to cut costs for fuel and other consumables.Mass dismissal of active trade union members
.These events were followed by the mass dismissal of unionized pilots. Between  September and  October , the company dismissed  members. In  of these cases the company invoked  company requirements' as the reason for the dismissals and in  cases it invoked the  serious breach of contractual obligations'  When the enterprise describes the serious breach of contractual obligations, it refers, inter alia, to confusing situations which led to delays for some flights. However, there is no clear relationship between the delays and the breach of contracts or internal regulations.
.Following the dismissal of these  workers, the company reinstated  of them. Amongst those not reinstated were eight former trade union directors and workers who participated in the  legal strike. Therefore, the measure was highly discriminatory given that, in essence, it affected the most active members of the organization, namely those who were dismissed for respecting a trade union agreement consisting in  work-to-rule'  without violating contractual or legal standards.
.The  workers affected filed a motion to vacate the dismissals before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago, filed under  Bustamante and Others versus Lan Chile S.A.' (Case No. -).Reduction in the workers' negotiating power
.The dismissals prior to the commencement of collective bargaining had repercussions on the collective bargaining process promoted by the trade union in that only  members participated. This represents a  per cent reduction in the number of participants compared with the previous collective bargaining process. The process was concluded without a strike and a four-year collective agreement was signed, with a  per cent reduction in the pay increase that otherwise would have been due. At the same time, the entreprise came to an agreement with three groups of pilots, who during the previous negotiation process formed part of the trade union, in the form of -month collective agreements with a lower pay adjustment.Pressure exerted by Lan Chile S.A. for thewithdrawal of trade union membership
.Following inspections by the employment services during the course of , it was established that unionized pilots and technicians were subjected to intense pressure aimed at making them withdraw membership from their trade union organization. This is shown in documents and communications issued by the employer which offer improved conditions of work that are incompatible with continued trade union membership. This approach was also reflected in the implicit threats of dismissal that were made by some supervisors and acknowledged by some workers during conversations with the officer from the Labour Inspectorate. As a result, the trade union executive board received membership withdrawals from mid- until the first-quarter of ; it currently has only  members.Discrimination against trade unionmembers with regard to training
.Lan Chile S.A. excluded trade union members from flight training for operating the new company airplanes. This was subsequently taken up by the trade union executive board with the employer, but this measure was not reversed. In the past, training was considered a recompense for pilots' seniority. According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the enterprise, such exclusion became apparent shortly before the collective bargaining process began. According to the information provided by the trade union executive board, this segregation still continues during the present year.Conditions for the reinstatement of dismissed pilots
.According to the information collected during the inspections conducted in the company in ,  pilots dismissed for disciplinary reasons, for having participated in the action entitled  work-to-rule'  were reinstated by the employer with the condition that they write a letter in which they had to acknowledge responsibility for the possible damage the industrial action may have caused; furthermore, they had to blame the trade union for forcing them into the alleged transgression. With their new individual contracts, these pilots did not regain the collective benefits that they had previously enjoyed.Replacement of dismissed unionized pilotsby recruiting foreign pilots
.The company failed to comply when requested for information by the inspectors in order to determine the legality of such recruitment. As a result of this conduct, the enterprise was fined on three occasions, on the most recent occasion, it was given the maximum administrative sanction for hindering the labour inspector s work.Harassment of trade union officials: Failure to grant thework agreed upon and professional disqualification
.In August , a complaint was made about the suspension from everyday duties of the trade union directors, Messrs. Nibaldo Jorquera and Artidoro Leal, and Lan Chile S.A. was sanctioned for failing to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contract. This also happened to the official Baldovino Bendix.
.This conduct began to take the form of excluding trade union officials from work schedules, which are documents used to notify each pilot of his flight itinerary, rest periods, training activities and other events for the following month. The collective agreement obliges the employer to provide this document.
.In January , another administrative fine was issued for failing to provide the officials Jozcef Szita, Artidoro Leal, Nibaldo Jorquera and Baldovino Bendix with work schedules and for failing to grant the first two mentioned officials the agreed upon work.
.It should be pointed out that, according to the provisions of the Civil Aeronautical Authority, in order to keep their license, pilots must be accredited with a determined number of flight hours. Without such a license they cannot work as pilots or co-pilots. In practice this amounts to professional disqualification and makes it impossible for them to work for this, or another, aviation company since they fail to meet the essential requirements.
.Moreover, the Government indicates the effects of the action taken by Lan Chile S.A. which constitutes anti-union and unfair practices in collective bargaining:' Trade union membership. After having been the most representative union and bringing together nearly all of the pilots and technicians at Lan Chile S.A., with  members, the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians now has only  members, as a result of the dismissals, membership withdrawals and creation of subsidiary enterprises.' Trade union executive board. In October , the trade union executive board was composed of five members. In the first-quarter of , only one director remained in service since three officials left the company, in one case following legal proceedings which lead to an agreement, and in the other cases following out-of-court negotiations. The last reorganization of the executive board, on  May , only enabled the election of three directors.' Trade union assets. In view of the reduction in membership, the trade union stopped receiving a significant amount of resources, in the form of trade union dues. Therefore, the trade union was forced to move to smaller headquarters and reduce the number of officers and advisers.' Collective bargaining. The collective bargaining of pilots, which until  had been carried out exclusively by the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians, was significantly fragmented during the last negotiating process, and therefore led to fewer collective benefits. Moreover, by negotiating separately, three groups signed instruments for  months, whereas the trade",-1,2002,Chile
151,"union did so for  months. Thus, during future negotiations, the pilots of Lan Chile S.A. will not be able to bargain collectively in the regulated manner or at the same time, and therefore, they will not be able to negotiate with their counterpart on an equal footing given that action, such as strikes, will be very difficult to sustain in this context.' Mass dismissal of pilots. The case in which  pilots are requesting a motion to vacate dismissals, before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago, filed under  Bustamante and Others versus Lan Chile S.A.' (Case No. -), is in the evidentiary stage. Undoubtedly, the most marked event in this case, owing to its seriousness and the number of workers affected, is the mass dismissal of members. The reasons given for these dismissals by the company are not connected to the global setback in civil aviation following the events of  September . The strategy developed by the company prior to the collective bargaining process with the aim of weakening the trade union actor with which it had to negotiate, shows that internal factors were the cause. The use of this strategy weakened the trade union, decreased the workers' negotiating prospects and was of serious detriment to those workers who were disqualified from carrying out their profession. Furthermore, this strategy devastated the trade union organization, clearing the way for the company to exert its power without an appropriate counterweight, which, before these events, had been provided by the Trade Union of Pilots and Technicians as a strong and independent trade union organization capable of establishing the counterbalance required in labour relations.
.Lastly, the Government declares that the conduct by Lan Chile S.A. aimed at making pilots renounce withdraw trade union membership is covered fully in the stipulations of article , paragraph (a) of the Labour Code, which states:Article . The following persons, in particular, are guilty of committing a violation of freedom of association:(a) Those who exert physical or moral force on workers in order to obtain their trade union membership, or membership withdrawal, or so that a worker abstains from belonging to a trade union, and those who similarly stop a worker from promoting the establishment of a trade union organization, or oblige him to do so.Therefore, the trade union should file a complaint for anti-union practices against Lan Chile S.A. before the labour courts. For the information of the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government attached a copy of a recent ruling, which recognizes the validity of ILO Conventions Nos.  and , accepts the complaint made by a trade union for anti-union practices in its enterprise and sentences the enterprise in question to pay a fine to the National Training and Employment Service (SENCE).
.The Committee decided to present an interim report on this case, considering that information was lacking. In particular, the Committee requests the Government to solicit information from the employers' organizations concerned, with a view to having at its disposal their views, as well as those of the enterprise concerned, on the questions at issue. The Committee will then re-examine this case taking into account the information received.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant alleges that Lan Chile S.A. conducted a campaign to break up its organization, which began in , and which took the form of a series of illegal practices of anti-union discrimination, above all in connection with negotiations aimed at concluding a new collective agreement. According to the complainant, these practices include a publicity campaign against the trade union, the mass dismissal of unionized pilots, threats of dismissal, pressure exerted on pilots and their family members so that the former withdraw union membership, discrimination against union members with regard to training, the recruitment of dismissed pilots in subsidiary enterprises under anti-union conditions (the acceptance of individual responsibility for the industrial action entitled  work-to-rule'  a statement that the trade union ordered them to participate in this action and agreement to be covered by individual employment contracts rather than the collective agreement), and the harassment of a trade union official.
.The Committee notes the statements made by the Government which confirm the allegations, qualify the alleged events as anti-union practices and even include (given that the Government s reply came six months after the allegations) more recent events contrary to trade union rights. Generally speaking, the Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations, which have been confirmed by the Government, and expresses its deep concern in view of the number, and nature, of the anti-union practices which were discriminatory or contrary to collective bargaining, and resulted in trade union membership dropping from  to .
.More specifically, the Committee notes the statements made by the Government in which it states that:' the action entitled  work-to-rule' taken by the trade union consisted in fulfilling the provisions of aeronautical regulations to the letter, which obviously did not involve the infringement of applicable standards; no contractual or legal standards were violated;' between  September and  October , the enterprise dismissed  trade union members. In  of these cases, the enterprise invoked  company requirements' and in  cases it involved a  serious breach of contractual obligations'  However, in these  cases, there is a clear relationship between the delays and the breaches in contractual obligations (or internal regulations). Following the dismissal of these  workers, the company reinstated  and amongst those not reinstated were eight former trade union directors and workers who participated in the  legal strike. Therefore, the measure was highly discriminatory given that, in essence, it affected the most active members of the organization, namely those who were dismissed for respecting a trade union agreement consisting in  work-to-rule'  without violating contractual or legal standards. Three of the five members of the trade union executive board left the company following legal proceedings (which lead to an agreement or out-of-court negotiations). Thirty-seven pilots affected filed a request to vacate the dismissals before the Fifth Labour Court of First Instance of Santiago;' the dismissals reduced the negotiating power of the workers (participants decreased by  per cent compared with the previous collective bargaining process) and while the enterprise signed a new collective agreement, it also came to an agreement with three groups of pilots that had formed part of the trade union. The collective agreement with the trade union was for four years ( months) with a  per cent reduction in the pay increase that otherwise would have been due, whereas the collective agreements with the groups of workers were for  months and a lower pay adjustment. Therefore, the pilots will not be able to bargain collectively at the same time and a strike will be very difficult to sustain in this context;' it has been established that unionized pilots and technicians were subjected to intense pressure aimed at making them withdraw trade union membership. This is shown in documents and communications issued by the employer which offer improved conditions of work that are incompatible with continued trade union membership. This approach was also reflected in the explicit threats of dismissal that were made by some supervisors and acknowledged by some workers during conversations with the officer from the Labour Inspectorate. The trade union can legally file a complaint before the courts for these events and have the company fined;' according to the inspections conducted within the enterprise, the latter excluded trade union members from flight training for operating new company aeroplanes;
.As regards the allegations relating to acts of anti-union discrimination (mass dismissal for conducting trade union activities, pressure exerted on pilots and their family members in order that the former withdraw their trade union membership, the exclusion of trade union members from training for operating new aeroplanes, the failure to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contracts of trade union officials and the reinstatement of more than half of those dismissed under anti-union conditions), the Committee notes that the Government confirms these allegations, that more than half of those dismissed were reinstated and that three came to an agreement within the framework of legal proceedings. The Committee notes that the Government also suggests that the pressure exerted by the enterprise so that pilots withdraw trade union membership could lead to legal proceedings in which the company could be given a punitive fine for anti-union practices. The Committee also notes that the acts of harassment against four trade union officials (failure to grant work) were sanctioned on two occasions with a fine imposed by the administrative authority.
.The Committee deeply deplores all of the anti-union practices described and highlights that no person shall be prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ], and that protection against anti-union discrimination should apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of",-1,2002,Chile
152,"or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities outside the workplace or, with the employer s consent, during working hours [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Furthermore, no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and legislation should lay down explicitly remedies and penalties against acts of anti-union discrimination in order to ensure the effective application of Article  of Convention No.  [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. To this effect, respect for the principles of freedom of association clearly requires that workers who consider that they have been prejudiced because of their trade union activities should have access to means of redress which are expeditious, inexpensive and fully impartial [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In the present case, the Committee highlights the importance that the discriminatory practices suffered by the complainant organization and its members be rectified and sanctioned without delay, and notes with concern that, according to the complainant organization, the proceedings relating to the dismissal of pilots will take more than two years.
.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of legal proceedings that are currently in course or that will intervene by reason of the previously mentioned anti-union dismissals and practices and expects that dissuasive and effective sanctions, along with compensatory measures, will be imposed without delay in order to put a stop to the enterprise s anti-union practices in the future. The Committee requests the Government to initiate discussions with a view to the possible reinstatement of the  pilots who have taken legal action to oppose their dismissal.
.With regard to the allegations that the enterprise bargained with individual pilots for anti-union purposes, the Committee observes that the Government confirms this individual bargaining and also refers to bargaining with groups of pilots for anti-union purposes and in order to prevent pilots from bargaining collectively in a simultaneous manner in the future. The Committee emphasizes that the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), provides that for the purpose of this Recommendation, the term  collective agreements' means all agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more representative workers' organizations, or, in the absence of such organizations, the representatives of the workers duly elected and authorized by them in accordance with national laws and regulations, on the other. In this respect, the Committee emphasized that the said Recommendation stresses the role of workers' organizations as one of the parties in collective bargaining. Direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, by-passing representative organizations where these exist, might in certain cases be detrimental to the principle that negotiation between employers and organizations of workers should be encouraged and promoted [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that in one previous case it found it difficult to reconcile the equal status given in the law to individual and collective contracts with the ILO principles on collective bargaining, according to which the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations should be encouraged and promoted, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. In effect, it seemed that the Act allowed collective bargaining by means of collective agreements, along with other alternatives, rather than promoting and encouraging it [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to prevent Lan Chile S.A. from bargaining for anti-union purposes with individual pilots or non-unionized groups of pilots, and to keep it informed of legal action that may be initiated with regard to such practices.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee decided to present an interim report on this case, considering that information was lacking. In particular, the Committee requests the Government to solicit information from the employers' organizations concerned, with a view to having at its disposal their views, as well as those of the enterprise concerned, on the questions at issue. The Committee will then re-examine this case.(b) The Committee emphasizes the seriousness of the allegations which have been confirmed by the Government, and expresses its deep concern in view of the number, and nature, of the anti-union practices that were discriminatory or contrary to collective bargaining and resulted in trade union membership dropping from  to .(c) As regards the allegations relating to acts of anti-union discrimination (mass dismissals for conducting trade union activities, pressure exerted on pilots and their family members so that the former withdrew their trade union membership, the exclusion of trade union members from flight training for operating new aeroplanes, the failure to grant the work agreed upon in the employment contracts of trade union officials, the reinstatement of more than half of those dismissed under anti-union conditions), the Committee deeply deplores these anti-union practices and highlights the importance that the discriminatory practices suffered by the complainant organization and its members be rectified and sanctioned without delay.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of legal proceedings that are currently in force or that will intervene by reason of the previously mentioned anti-union dismissals and practices, and expects that effective and dissuasive sanctions, along with compensatory measures, will be imposed without delay in order to put a stop to the enterprise s anti?union practices in the future. The Committee requests the Government to initiate discussions with a view to the possible reinstatement of the  pilots who have taken legal action against their dismissal.(e) As regards the complainant s allegations and the Government s statement that the enterprise bargained with individual pilots or with groups of pilots for anti-union purposes, and in order to prevent pilots from bargaining collectively in a simultaneous manner in the future, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to prevent Lan Chile S.A. from bargaining for anti-union purposes with individual pilots or non-unionized groups of pilots, and to keep it informed of legal action that may be initiated with regard to such practices.",2,2002,Chile
153,".At its November  meeting, the Committee requested the Government and the authorities of the municipality of Empedrado to take measures to reinstate the trade union leader Juana Contreras Labarca, without loss of earnings, in a comparable post if the one she occupied had been eliminated, and to keep it informed of any developments [see th Report, para. ].
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that the trade union official has still not been reinstated owing to the lack of municipal budgetary resources.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to continue to make every effort towards ensuring the reinstatement of Juana Contreras Labarca, without loss of pay, in a comparable post if the one she occupied had been eliminated, and to keep it informed of any developments.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT) states that the Association of Health Workers of the Municipality of Empedrado was established on  September . As recorded in the founding document, Ms. Juana Contreras Labarca joined the executive committee and took office as President. The employer was informed of this on  September of the same year. In addition, the Maule Regional Labour Directorate notified the mayor of the Municipality of Empedrado on  February  that the Association had been validly established, had been granted legal personality and that its president, Ms. Contreras Labarca, was covered by trade union immunity, all of the above in accordance with the provisions of Act No. ,.
.The complainant alleges that the Municipality of Empedrado terminated the employment relationship of Ms. Juana Contreras Labarca as of  January  by Decree No.  of  December . The complainant adds that it petitioned the Maule Regional Office of the Comptroller on  January  to instruct the employer to reinstate her immediately in her post and in the duties which she was performing at the time of the unlawful dismissal. This petition was examined and accepted by the Regional Office of the Comptroller, which handed down Decision No.  of  March , stating that  the post occupied by Ms. Juana Contreras Labarca cannot be eliminated from the health staff of the Municipality of Empedrado, given her status of trade union official, as stated' 
.The complainant states further that the Maule Regional Office of the Comptroller, by Decision No.  of  March , ordered the immediate execution of the abovementioned decision and that the case had been examined by the Legal Department of the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, which issued Decision No.  of  September , confirming the decision of the Maule Regional Office of the Comptroller, ordering immediate execution of its decisions and stating further that this situation was in violation of legal and constitutional provisions. Lastly, the complainant states that an appeal for protection was filed with the Talca Court of Appeals on  February  requesting the reinstatement of Ms. Contreras Labarca in accordance with the order of the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that on  September , the Municipal Council of the Municipality of Empredrado, composed of six democratically elected members belonging to four different political parties, agreed on the establishment of staffing levels of the Municipal Department of Primary Health Care for the year , which included a -hour reduction in the last category, i.e. category  D'  The Maule Health Service was notified of this agreement on  September  and did not object to the elimination of staff in category  D'  The Government points out that the only member of staff in category  D' was Ms. Juana Contreras Labarca.
.The Government states that the contract of Ms. Juana Contreras Labarca, a category  D' worker, with the municipality was terminated as of  January  by Municipal Decree No.  of  December , based on the agreement reached in the Municipal Council in September . The Municipal Decree also ordered that she be paid statutory compensation.
.The Government adds that section  of Act No. ,, laying down regulations for municipal primary health care, lists the grounds for termination of the employment relationship of staff and provides in clause (i) that employees who are members of primary health-care staff shall only be removed from such staff as a result of a reduction or change in staffing levels in accordance with section  of the Act. Section  lays down the factors to be taken into consideration by the administrative body to set appropriate staffing levels for carrying out the health activities each year, which must conform to the procedure laid down in section  of the Act. According to the administrative case law of the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic, in cases where the establishment of staffing levels involves a reduction or modification, it is for the municipality to exercise its own discretion in determining which employees will be affected by such measures and cease to be staff members on the grounds set forth in section (i) of Act No. ,. Moreover, this is consistent with the definition of staffing levels set forth in section  of the Act, under which it is for each administrative body to determine the total weekly hours of work required for its activities.
.The Government states that on  February , Ms. Contreras Labarca filed an appeal for protection with the Talca Court of Appeal claiming violation of the constitutional guarantee of protection of work and requesting that she be reinstated. On  July , the Talca Court of Appeals ruled the appeal inadmissible. The worker concerned subsequently filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, which upheld the decision of the Court of Appeals and ruled the appeal inadmissible.
.According to the Government, as at May , the worker in question has not gone to the Municipality of Empedrado to sign the release terminating her employment relationship, neither has she collected the compensation awarded to her in accordance with the law. Lastly, the Government states that in view of the above, Ms. Juana Contreras Labarca should bring the case before the ordinary courts by proceeding to enforce her rights against the Municipality of Empedrado, as the labour departments are not competent to rule on violations of labour legislation committed by the municipalities against their employees.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that decisions to determine staffing levels of workers which reduce or increase hours of work of certain categories of employees in municipalities are the subject of consultations with the trade union organizations concerned.(b) As regards the termination of the employment relationship of trade union leader Ms. Juana Contreras Labarca, the Committee, bearing in mind Recommendation No. , requests the Government and the authorities of the Municipality of Empedrado to take measures to reinstate the trade union leader in question, without loss of earnings, in a comparable post if the one she occupied has been eliminated, and to keep it informed of any developments.",0,2001,Chile
154,".At its March  meeting, the Committee requested the Government to send a copy of the ruling handed down in the criminal proceeding relating to the death of Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora during the strike at the FABISA S.A. enterprise in May  [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  April , the Government stated that the Labour Directorate did not have any information regarding the action brought by Mr. Luis Lagos' widow before the th Criminal Court of Santiago (No. -), about which his widow had reported.
.The Committee recalls that in its previous response the Government had reported the content of the criminal ruling in this case, also indicating the amount of the compensation that was due to the family of Luis Lagos, and it again requests that the Government send the ruling handed down in respect of the aforementioned acts of violence.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings concerning the death of Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Donaldo Zamora during the strike at the FABISA S.A. enterprise in May  [see rd Report, para. ].
.In a communication dated  October , the Government states that the th Criminal Court of Santiago, which has jurisdiction in this case, is examining the case concerning the alleged manslaughter of the worker Luis Lagos B. and the injuries sustained by Donaldo Zamora. The case is at the plenary stage and a criminal indictment has been filed. The bus driver who ran down and caused the death of Luis Lagos and injured Donaldo Zamora is the subject of legal proceedings and has been released on bail. The family of the deceased worker is acting as plaintiff in the case and is seeking financial compensation for the incident, in addition to any criminal liability that may apply.
.The Government states that the th Labour Court of Santiago ruled that the FABISA S.A. enterprise was responsible for the worker's death. It also ruled that the enterprise must provide financial compensation to the Lagos family, given that the incident was an occupational accident. The Labour Court in its ruling stated that the FABISA S.A. enterprise was responsible for the death of Mr. Lagos, since a company manager had instructed the driver to force his way into the plant premises. The Labour Court also ruled that the enterprise must pay the following sums in compensation to the family of the deceased man: for loss of earnings - ,, pesos; for emotional distress - ,, pesos; and for the four surviving children of the deceased - ,, pesos.
.The Committee takes note of this information, and requests the Government to send a copy of the ruling handed down in the proceedings concerning the death of Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Donaldo Zamora during the strike at the FABISA S.A. enterprise in May .
.At its November  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues still pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way concerning the death of Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Donaldo Zamora during the strike held in the FABISA S.A. enterprise in May . The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the sentence handed down by the judicial authority concerning the dismissal of  workers following the conclusion of the said strike.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the workers who were dismissed and who petitioned the judicial authorities in this regard individually reached a financial agreement with the enterprise. There are currently no disputes at the enterprise and a new collective agreement has been signed.
.The Committee notes this information and once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings concerning the death of Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Donaldo Zamora during the strike held at the FABISA S.A. enterprise in May .
.At its June  meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendations on the issues still pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way concerning the death the Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora during the strike held in the FABISA enterprise in May . Moreover, the Committee deeply regrets that the FABISA enterprise has failed to respect the agreement to review the dismissals of  workers following the strike. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation concerning these dismissals and, if it is found that the workers were dismissed for exercising their trade union activities, to take the necessary measures within its power to ensure that they are reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the criminal proceedings concerning the death of Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora are presently being judged since the prosecution was filed on  July . The period of time granted to the complainants to contest the transfer has not yet expired. At the same time, the Court entered a temporary and partial non-suit for the alleged homicide of Mr. Lagos and the alleged attempted homicide of the seriously injured worker, in favour of Mr. Hernndez, an executive from the FABISA enterprise. Both decisions to enter a non-suit were appealed by the complainants and the Court of Second Instance is now processing these appeals. The only complainants in this case are the relatives of the victims.
.As regards the situation of the  workers dismissed following the strike, during the collective bargaining process, the Government states that the  workers dismissed shortly after the strike was concluded went to the tribunal to request legal compensation for unfair dismissal. With regard to the other five workers who were later dismissed, they came to an agreement with the employer for the payment of compensation according to their years of service and signed the corresponding final discharges, thereby terminating their working relationship.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings concerning the death of Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora during the strike held at the FABISA enterprise in May . The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the sentence handed down by the judicial authority concerning the dismissal of  workers following the conclusion of the said strike.
.The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting, and on that occasion:-	expressed the hope that the judicial proceedings initiated in relation to the death of Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora during the strike held in the FABISA enterprise will determine those responsible and be concluded rapidly and that, in the event that it is determined that a crime has been committed, the guilty persons will be sanctioned; and-	requested the Government to endeavour to ensure that the agreement to review the situation of the workers who participated in the strike held in the FABISA enterprise between  April and  June  is respected, that the situation of the workers dismissed after the agreement was reached is reviewed, and if it is found that they were dismissed for exercising their legitimate trade union activities, to take effective measures to ensure that they are reinstated. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken in this respect [see th Report, paras. ?].
.In a communication dated  March , the Government states that:(a) the judicial proceedings filed under No. - with the th Criminal Court of Santiago, against the driver of the vehicle that caused the accident leading to the death of the worker Mr. Luis Lagos and injuring Mr. Donaldo Zamora, are now in the pre-trial investigation stage. The driver faces charges of homicide and causing serious injury and has been released on bail for the payment of a sum of money; and(b) the FABISA enterprise, employer of the dismissed workers, in spite of the good offices of the Labour Directorate, represented by the Regional Labour Director of the Metropolitan Region, did not fulfil its commitment to review the dismissals of the workers with a view to their reinstatement but, on the contrary, dismissed them for reasons that removed their entitlement to compensation. Legal action concerning possible anti-union practices at the time of the events should have been taken by the persons affected, but they failed to take the issue to the competent judicial authorities. In this respect, it should be noted that, through the reforms introduced by Law No. , the legislation concerning anti-union practices has been amended, giving the Labour Directorate the power to",1,2001,Chile
155,"take a more active role when it becomes aware of situations or activities that could be classed as anti-union practices. The law provides an obligation for the Directorate to investigate, ex officio or at the request of an interested party, the facts at its disposal and, if appropriate, to transfer them to the competent judicial authority. It shall also enclose the report of the Inspectorate, which constitutes a significant procedural improvement in comparison with previous legislation. Moreover, it is provided with the power to become a party, if it considers it necessary, in trials pertaining to this issue. The recent legal amendments also establish a new judicial procedure for examining cases concerning anti-union and unfair practices, designed to speed up proceedings, to the benefit of the workers concerned. A significant increase in the fines imposed to sanction anti-union practices, which will consist of sums of between  and  monthly tax units, will act as a disincentive to discrimination. These labour reforms will have a positive impact on labour relations, discouraging practices that hinder the effective exercise of trade union rights and collective negotiation, and enhancing the protection offered to those concerned.
.Taking note of this information, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way concerning the death of Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora during the strike held in the FABISA enterprise in May . Moreover, the Committee deeply regrets that the FABISA enterprise has failed to respect the agreement to review the dismissals of  workers following the strike. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation concerning these dismissals and, if it is found that the workers were dismissed for exercising their trade union activities, to take all necessary measures within its power to ensure that they are reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union International of Workers of the Energy, Metal, Chemistry, Oil and Related Industries (UIS-TEMQPIA) dated  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  June , the Trade Union International of Workers of the Energy, Metal, Chemistry, Oil and Related Industries (UIS-TEMQPIA) alleges that, by using a provision of the Labour Code, the Bianchi Bicycle Factory S.A. (FABISA) hired workers to replace trade union members who were carrying out a strike beginning on  April  in order to obtain a wage increase.
.The complainant adds that on  May , after three days of a legal strike, when the trade union members were peacefully demonstrating at the entrance gate of the company, executives of the enterprise ordered a driver belonging to an outside transport company to drive through a strike picket that was blocking the access of the vehicle, which was transporting executives and strike-breakers. The complainant states that, disobeying police orders to park the bus so that the workers could enter on foot, the driver drove into the strikers. As a result, Mr. Luis Lagos was killed and Mr. Donaldo Zamora seriously injured.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that the FABISA enterprise and the trade union had concluded a collective agreement that was due to expire in May ; on  March  the trade union initiated collective bargaining by presenting a draft collective agreement, involving  unionized workers and  members who up to that time had not been unionized. The enterprise responded within the time limit, rejecting the workers' proposals. On  April the workers voted in favour of rejecting the employer s final offer and approved a strike by  per cent of quorum. The strike began on  April at . a.m., and as soon as it had begun the employer hired workers to replace the strikers. The replacement of workers was carried out in accordance with the legislation in force (sections  and  of the Labour Code), and therefore there can be no legal objection to the employer s conduct.
.The Government adds that the workers involved gathered in a public demonstration at the entrance gate of the enterprise and that tensions arose between the parties. For this reason, on  May the employer sought the good offices of the North Santiago Municipal Labour Inspectorate, which did not take effect immediately as the trade union leaders could not be located. On the fourth day of the strike,  May, at about . a.m., when a group of demonstrators were attempting to prevent replacement workers brought in by bus from entering the enterprise, the worker Luis Lagos was killed and another worker, Donaldo Zamora, was injured when they were run over by the vehicle driven by Francisco Curiln Surez. The Government states that these acts are the subject of proceedings filed under No. - with the th Criminal Court of Santiago, the plaintiffs being the Confederation of Metal Workers (CONTRAMET), the trade union of workers of the FABISA enterprise, and the families of the deceased and injured workers. Proceedings have been filed against the driver of the bus for homicide and are now at the investigation stage with certain formalities still pending, and the court is examining the responsibility of the chief administrative officer of the FABISA enterprise, who was in the bus that ran over the victims, but there is still not enough evidence to indict him.
.The Government states that in view of the public impact of the death of the worker, Luis Lagos, on the following day the activity of the enterprise was suspended. The talks between the parties were broken off and only resumed, following intervention by the Regional Labour Directorate, during the week after the tragedy that cost the worker s life; the enterprise continued operating with replacement workers and the strikers resumed their demonstrations around the factory and in public areas, this time denouncing the enterprise s responsibility for the worker s death.
.Lastly, the Government states that: () on  June , the workers concerned decided to stop the legal strike and went back to work on the following day, on the terms laid down by the employer in its initial reply, which was also its final offer; () the week after the process was finalized, some  workers were dismissed (the trade union leaders filed a complaint against this with the Regional Labour Directorate, which prompted the convening of a tripartite meeting at which a number of agreements were reached, including a review of the situation of the dismissed workers; examination of the proposal that remuneration be based on productivity; an improvement in the labour relations climate, seeking the advice of a consultant; and consideration of the possibility of voluntary retirement of the workers with satisfactory compensation); () according to recent conversations with trade union leaders, these agreements were being carried out, but five more dismissals of workers involved in the collective bargaining process had been confirmed; and () it was observed that the management of the enterprise and the trade union leaders have made efforts to restore relations, but a climate of resentment and mistrust still persists among the workers and has not yet been overcome.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant alleges that the FABISA. enterprise hired workers to replace members of a trade union who were engaged in a strike and that homicide was committed and serious injuries inflicted on strikers attempting to block access to the factory of a bus carrying executives and workers hired to replace the strikers.
.As regards the allegation concerning the replacement of strikers under the provisions of the Labour Code, the Committee notes that after the enterprise had rejected a draft collective agreement, the workers called a strike and, since the beginning of the strike, the employer hired workers to fill the strikers' posts and that the replacements were in accordance with the legislation in force. The Committee notes that the recent legislative reform maintains the possibility of replacing strikers. Section  of the Labour Code provides that:If a strike takes place in an enterprise or an institution in which the interruption of the work could cause real and irreparable damages to its equipment or damage the health of users of a health or social assistance establishment or which provides essential services, the trade union or negotiating agent has to submit a list of indispensable workers in order to accomplish the work the interruption of which could cause such damage. The union or negotiating agent must submit to the employer, following the employer s written request, the list of workers who will be part of the emergency team, within  hours of the written request. In case of non-compliance, the employer can ask the Labour Inspection to intervene in this regard. The previous provision",2,2001,Chile
156,"applies in the case of a refusal from the workers to provide the said list, or when there is a disagreement concerning who should be on the list. The request to the Labour Inspection must be submitted by the employer within five days following the refusal of the workers or in case of disagreement on the content of the list, and the decision must be applied within  hours following the employers request. The decision of the Labour Inspection can be appealed to the Labour Court within five days of the said decision or once the abovementioned delay has expired.Article  of the Labour Code provides:It is forbidden to replace strikers under the last offer provides at least, in the manner and delays provided for in article (): (a) the same provisions as those of the contract, the collective agreement or arbitral award (adjusted to take into account the cost-of-living index, as set by the National Institute of Statistics or by the competent organization); (b) an annual minimum increment of the consumer price index for the length of the contract, except as regards the last  months; (c) a replacement indemnity with a value equal to four motivation premiums for each replacement worker. The total amount of this indemnity will be paid, in equal parts, to striking workers, within five days from the end of the strike. In this case, the employer may, from the first day of the strike, hire the workers it deems necessary to fulfil the duties of strikers. Moreover, the workers may, in this case, choose to go back to their post on the th day after the beginning of the strike. Should the employer not complete an offer in line with the conditions provided for in subparagraph  and in the circumstances therein indicated, it may hire the workers it deems necessary from the th day of the strike, provided it gives the indemnity mentioned in subparagraph (c). However, the employers may hire the workers it deems necessary to fulfil the duties of strikers, from the th day of the strike. Where no collective agreement is in force, the offer mentioned in subparagraph  is considered as made if the employer offers at least a minimum annual increment, indexed on the consumer price index for the length of the contract, except as regards the last  months. Under this article, the employer may present more than one offer, provided that at least one of these proposals fulfils the conditions provided for in said provision and, as the case may be, provide for the indemnity mentioned in subparagraph (c). If the workers decide to reintegrate these parts individually under this article, they do so at least under the conditions mentioned in the employer s last offer. Once the employer has exercised the rights mentioned in this article, it may not withdraw the offers mentioned therein.In this respect, the Committee recalls that  the hiring of workers to break a strike in a sector which cannot be regarded as an essential sector in the strict sense of the term, and hence one in which strikes might be forbidden, constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee also observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made observations to the same effect on this issue with respect to Chile. Regretting that the FABISA enterprise ' which manufactures bicycles ' has hired workers to replace strikers, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend sections  and  of the Labour Code which allow the replacement of workers engaged in a strike in services that are not essential in the strict sense of the term (i.e. services whose interruption may endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).
.As regards the allegation concerning the death of Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora when they attempted, together with other workers, to block the access to the factory of a vehicle transporting executives and other workers, the Committee notes that the Government states that a judicial inquiry is being carried out in which proceedings have been filed against the driver of the bus for homicide and that the responsibility of the chief administrative officer of the enterprise who was riding in the bus is being examined. In this respect, deeply deploring the death of and serious injuries sustained by the strikers in question, the Committee expresses the hope that the judicial proceedings will determine those responsible and be concluded rapidly and that in the event it is determined that a crime has been committed, the guilty persons will be sanctioned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government states that after the end of the strike a number of workers were dismissed in two stages ( at first, followed by five more) and that although the management of the enterprise and the trade union leaders have made efforts to restore relations, a climate of resentment and mistrust persists among the workers and has not been overcome. In this respect, the Committee also notes that the Government states that after the initial  dismissals following the strike, it was agreed that their situation would be reviewed, but that five more workers were subsequently dismissed. The Committee recalls that  respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that workers should not be dismissed or refused re-employment on account of their having participated in a strike or other industrial action. It is irrelevant for these purposes whether the dismissal occurs during or after the strike' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Regretting these dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to endeavour to ensure that the agreement to review the situation of the workers initially dismissed is respected, that the situation of those subsequently dismissed is also reviewed, and that if it is found that they were dismissed for exercising their legitimate trade union activities effective measures are taken to reinstate them. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken in this respect.
.The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend sections  and  of the Labour Code allowing the replacement of workers engaged in a strike in services that are not essential in the strict sense of the term (i.e. services whose interruption may endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).(b) Deeply deploring the death of Mr. Luis Lagos and the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Donaldo Zamora during the strike held in the FABISA enterprise, the Committee expresses the hope that the judicial proceedings initiated in this respect will determine those responsible and be concluded rapidly and that, in the event that it is determined that a crime has been committed, the guilty persons will be sanctioned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in the respect.(c) The Committee requests the Government to endeavour to ensure that the agreement to review the situation of the workers who participated in the strike held in the FABISA enterprise between  April and  June  is respected, that the situation of the workers dismissed after the agreement was reached is reviewed, and if it is found that they were dismissed for exercising their legitimate trade union activities, to take effective measures to ensure that they are reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken in this respect.(d) The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case.",-1,2001,Chile
157,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee observed that the complainants disputed that resolution No.  of  July , issued by the Ministry of the Economy, Public Works and Reconstruction, should prohibit the right to strike not only for those workers at the Metropolitan Sanitation Company who were providing an essential service, but also for those who were involved in areas that were clearly separate from the provision of essential services, such as administrative tasks, legal advice, design projects, planning, construction and works inspection, information technology and others. The Committee recalled that water supply services were an essential service where the right to strike might be prohibited with adequate protection to compensate for that limitation [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ]. However, the Committee noted that the Government stated that further investigation was needed as regards the claim presented by the complainants, in which the different sections or duties that were carried out within the company be defined so that only those workers who were directly linked to the provision of the essential service be deprived of the right to strike and that the investigation should be carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security as soon as possible. The Committee appreciated and encouraged that initiative and hoped that the investigation would be carried out very shortly.
.In a communication dated  January , the Government states that the Labour Services are currently studying how to define the different sections or duties within the Metropolitan Sanitation Company in order to identify the workers who are directly linked to the provision of the essential service, and that it will inform the Committee as soon as the studies are finalized.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement with interest and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from Trade Union No. , Metropolitan Sanitation Company, Trade Union No. , Metropolitan Sanitation Company, and the Professional and Technical Employees' Trade Union of the Metropolitan Sanitation Company.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  January , Trade Union No. , Metropolitan Sanitation Company, Trade Union No. , Metropolitan Sanitation Company, and the Professional and Technical Employees' Trade Union of the Metropolitan Sanitation Company state that in resolution No.  of  July , published on  August , the Ministry of the Economy, Public Works and Reconstruction, in collaboration with the Ministries of Defence and of Labour and Social Security have included the Metropolitan Sanitation Company (EMOS S.A.) in the list of companies falling into the categories referred to in article  of the Labour Code which provides the possibility of prohibiting a strike and referring conflicts to compulsory arbitration, in particular, for those companies the interruption of the services of which would endanger the health or provision of services to the population.
.The resolution implies that all workers in the company will be affected by the prohibition to strike and will be obliged, in the case of a labour dispute, to have recourse to compulsory arbitration.
.The complainant acknowledges that the production and distribution of drinking water and the collection and treatment of waste water that is carried out by EMOS S.A. for those living in the metropolitan area can and should be registered as essential services, inasmuch as they involve the life and health of the population.
.However, EMOS S.A. is involved in providing services other than these essential services that are clearly distinct from the latter, as are all the purely administrative services. Among those services which remain purely administrative should be mentioned, for example, those relating to legal advice (public prosecution), design projects, construction planning and works inspection, information technology, logistics, property registration, archiving, library services, public relations, infrastructure management, commercial management, financial management and administration, human resources, etc. Furthermore, in those sections dealing with production, and distribution of drinking water and collection and treatment of waste water there are professional, technical and administrative personnel whose jobs have nothing to do with the production of essential services.
.The complainants believe that the right to strike should be prohibited only for those workers who are directly involved in essential services and not for the workers whose jobs do not encompass essential services and whose strike action would not prevent the company from fulfilling its obligation to provide essential services.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government states that there are certain restrictions to the right to strike in Chilean legislation, the most relevant being when this right is prohibited.
.This prohibition is to be found in article , No. , of the Political Constitution of the Republic and in article  of the Labour Code, the latter of which provides that some workers who may bargain collectively may not call a strike. The workers concerned include those who work in certain companies decided upon on a yearly basis under the joint resolution issued by the Ministries of National Defence, Economy, Public Works and Reconstruction, and Labour, to which the complainants refer.
.This restriction to a constitutional right, as the right to strike should be, as such narrowly interpreted and therefore applicable only to those companies:' which are public utilities;' where a stoppage in services would seriously endanger health;' where a strike would acutely affect the provision of essential services to the population;' where a stoppage would mean that the economy of the country was endangered; and' where a stoppage would seriously endanger national security.
.With regard to these criteria it should be mentioned that since , democratic governments have gradually reduced the original list, trying to ensure that the restrictions are imposed only on those companies that effectively provide essential services, such as those mentioned in the previous paragraph.
.Furthermore, there is currently a series of labour reforms being carried out that will bring the country s labour legislation closer to that which is laid down in Conventions Nos.  and  on freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.With regard to the rest, the description previously mentioned conforms with that laid down by the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association, which states that  to determine situations in which a strike could be prohibited, the criteria which has to be established is the existence of a clear and imminent threat to the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population' 
.In this context the ILO has listed those services that, in its opinion, can be considered essential. These include the hospital sector, electricity services, water supply services, the telephone service and air traffic control.
.Therefore, the ILO itself lists among the services that it considers to be essential services related to water supply, which is the case of the Metropolitan Sanitation Company which, without a shadow of a doubt, does supply an essential service.
.Given the previous information, it should also be pointed out that the constitutional provision previously quoted expressly states in its final paragraph that public service employees shall not declare strike action. Neither shall those persons working in corporations or companies, whatever their category, purpose or function, that provide essential services to the public or whose stoppage would seriously endanger the health of the population, the economy of the country, the provision of essential services to the population or national security. The law lays down procedures available to those corporations or companies whose workers are subject to that prohibition.
.Under constitutional law, this prohibition applies to the company in its entirety and, therefore, to all those working at that company. These workers may have recourse to compulsory arbitration, a procedure that replaces the right to strike.
.Finally, the Government states that further investigation is needed as regards the claim presented by the complainants, in which the different sections or duties that are carried out within the company be defined so that only those workers who are directly linked to the provision of the essential service be subjected to that prohibition; that investigation shall be carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security as soon as possible.
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint the complainants dispute that resolution No.  of  July , issued by the Ministry of the Economy, Public Works and Reconstruction, should prohibit the right to strike not only for those workers at the Metropolitan Sanitation Company who are providing an essential service, but also for those who are involved in areas that are clearly separate from the provision of essential services, such as administrative tasks, legal advice, design projects, planning, construction and works inspection, information technology and others.
.The Committee notes that the Government states that water supply services are an essential service.
.The Committee recalls that  the",-1,2001,Chile
158,"right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population)' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.The Committee also recalls that water supply services are an essential service where the right to strike may be prohibited with adequate protection to compensate for this limitation [see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ]. The Committee notes, however, that the Government states that further investigation is needed as regards the claim presented by the complainants, in which the different sections or duties that are carried out within the company be defined so that only those workers who are directly linked to the provision of the essential service be subjected to the prohibition of the right to strike; that investigation shall be carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security as soon as possible.

159,".The complaint is contained in communications from the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Food Industry, Tourism, Hotel and Restaurant, and Related and Allied Workers (COTIACH) dated  October and  December .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  October and  December , the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Food Industry, Tourism, Hotel and Restaurant, and Related and Allied Workers (COTIACH) alleges that since approximately , the enterprise Agrcola Arizta Ltda. periodically obliges its workers to sign, under threat of dismissal or other reprisals, instruments which it calls  collective labour agreements'  According to the COTIACH, these documents contain labour-related provisions and are drawn up by the enterprise without any worker participation or any type of real bargaining that would afford them collective status. In fact, the workers do not actually sign these  agreements' but instead a blank sheet of paper before the head of personnel which contains their name and identity card details, and this document is subsequently attached to the instrument drawn up by the enterprise and sent to the Labour Inspectorate for registration.
.The complainant adds that the purpose of this practice is to prevent workers at the enterprise using their constitutional right to collective bargaining. Each time a trade union tries to bargain collectively on behalf of its members, Agrcola Arizta Ltda. objects to the involvement of any of its workers who have signed the abovementioned agreements, given that as they are in principle covered by a collective agreement currently in force, according to Chilean labour standards (articles () and  of the Labour Code) they are not entitled to engage in further collective bargaining until the end of the term of application of the relevant instruments. However, even if the workers have signed such instruments, they do not constitute collective agreements. According to the COTIACH, article  of the Labour Code that authorizes such practices is contrary to the principles of freedom of association: the bargaining in question takes place without trade union participation and the workers involved do not have the right to strike. These instruments, when they are indeed signed by workers, have been called  multiple individual contracts' or contracts of adhesion, as from a legal standpoint they constitute individual labour contracts.
.The complainant adds that on  November , company union No.  submitted a draft collective labour contract, on behalf of  affiliated workers, and that the enterprise objected to  of the workers participating in the negotiations, maintaining that they had signed  collective agreements' and pointing out that other workers had left the enterprise, leaving only six workers entitled to be represented by the trade union in the collective bargaining process. The COTIACH states that following a detailed study of the facts, the Labour Inspectorate decided that the instruments cited by the enterprise to prevent the majority of the unionized workers participating in the bargaining process did not constitute collective instruments and ordered the enterprise to include these workers in the negotiations (Decision No.  of  November ). The enterprise lodged an application for protection with the Court of Appeal of San Miguel, considering that the Labour Inspectorate had violated its right of ownership by refusing to recognize the guarantees and provisions contained in the collective agreements.
.The COTIACH states that the Court of Appeal declare Decision No.  issued by the Labour Inspectorate null and void because it affected the right of ownership of Agrcola Arizta Ltda., and this judgement was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice. Nevertheless, the complainant indicates that Agrcola Arizta Ltda. has recently been sanctioned by the Second Labour Court of San Miguel for engaging in anti?union practices against the complainant trade union. More specifically, the judgement handed down by the court magistrate indicates that the enterprise s practice of making workers sign such  collective labour agreements' is a violation of freedom of association and imposes a fine on the enterprise.
.According to the COTIACH, the impact of the above actions on trade union No.  is clear: at the enterprise there are a dozen  collective agreements' covering a varying number of workers (between  and ) and they all have different periods of validity, allowing Agrcola Arizta Ltda. to ensure that the trade union will never be able to bargain collectively on behalf of all its members.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that Agrcola Arizta Ltda. has also engaged in other conduct in violation of freedom of association. More specifically, it alleges that workers joining the enterprise are constantly pressurized not to join the trade union and that affiliated workers are pressurized to end their membership. Just one fact suffices to demonstrate the magnitude of anti-unionism in this enterprise: company union No.  was established five years ago with over  members and by the end of  its members had fallen to just , in other words approximately  workers had left the organization, many of whom had been dismissed, while others had given in to the enterprise s pressures and threats.
.In its communication of  March  the Government states that according to the information registered by the Labour Services in  and , the enterprise Agrcola Arizta Ltda. concluded the following collective agreements: collective agreement signed on  March  with  workers, in force until  February ; collective agreement signed on  October  with  workers, in force until  September ; collective agreement signed on  March  with  workers, in force until  February ; collective agreement signed on  April  with  workers, in force until  March ; collective agreement signed on  May  with  workers, in force until  April ; and collective agreement signed on  October  with  workers, in force until  September . All these agreements affect employees' work at the establishment situated in the commune of La Cisterna, Santiago. Two further agreements relate to workers in establishments in the city of Melipilla: collective agreement signed on  May  with  workers, in force until  May ; and collective agreement signed on  September  with  workers, in force until  August .
.The Government adds that the Municipal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Sur and the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Melipilla, in whose jurisdictions establishments belonging to the enterprise are located, have conducted a number of investigations into these collective agreements to determine whether they are in fact the result of true collective bargaining and are consequently legally binding as such in the terms stipulated in article  of the Labour Code, which reads as follows:Without prejudice to the regulated collective bargaining procedure, with the prior agreement of the parties, at any time and without restrictions of any type, it shall be possible to initiate, between one or more employers and one or more trade union organizations or groups of workers, irrespective of the number of their members, direct negotiations that shall not be subject to rules of procedure, to agree on common conditions of work and remuneration or other benefits, applicable to one or more enterprises, premises, sites or establishments for a specific period of time. Temporary or provisional trade unions or groups of workers shall be able to reach agreement with one or more employers on common conditions of work and remuneration for specific sites or tasks of a temporary or seasonal nature. These negotiations shall not be subject to the procedural rules established for regulated collective bargaining, neither will they give rise to the rights, prerogatives and obligations indicated in this Code. The collective instruments signed shall be called collective agreements (convenios colectivos) and shall have the same effects as collective contracts (contratos colectivos), without prejudice to the special rules referred to in article .
.The Government states that from the investigations carried out, which include confidential interviews with workers covered by the collective agreement in question, trade union officials and enterprise representatives, it has been possible to conclude repeatedly that none of the instruments reviewed can be qualified as a collective agreement resulting from the negotiation process laid down in article , as the facts considered clearly demonstrate an absence of collective consent or real participation in the supposed negotiations, which supports the view that these agreements are in fact  contracts of adhesion' whereby workers are asked individually to accept a specific contractual proposal offered by Agrcola Arizta Ltda.
.The Government indicates with respect to this practice that the Labour Inspectorate developed a repeated and uniform approach, establishing that the legislator shall only consider as a collective agreement one which is signed by a collective subject, in other words, as far as workers are concerned, by employees grouped together for that purpose, which is only the case when they are acting through one",0,2000,Chile
160,"or more trade union organizations or when they have agreed together to do so.
.A review of the various investigative reports into this subject reveal a number of elements in support of the conclusion that the agreements in question do not represent the collective will, for example the absence of the participation or consent of the workers' group, whose signature appears on the document, is demonstrated by the fact that the proposed agreement is submitted on the initiative of the enterprise, which defined its content in advance, with the employees participating little, if at all. Neither is there any participation through representatives elected or appointed by the workers' group as, according to the investigators' findings in all the cases in point, either the enterprise appoints them or they nominate themselves. Similarly, the shortness of the process is striking, and once again points to a lack of worker participation, as the period between the presentation of the offer by the enterprise and the signing of the agreement is generally only two days, and during this time the workers do not have access to the proposed text; and the (two) meetings held with the groups are extremely short and involve virtually no discussion, as they consist of the enterprise providing information about and inviting acceptance of the proposed offer. Lastly, the employees, grouped together in sections, are called upon to sign the document, a procedure which is carried out in the presence of a person of authority.
.With reference to the specific situation of regulated collective bargaining by workers' union No. , the Government indicates that this began on  November  when the corresponding draft collective contract was submitted to the enterprise; a total of  workers from the La Cisterna establishment participated. In its reply, the enterprise objected to the participation of  of the workers, owing to other collective agreements being in force which excluded them from participating in the process. The negotiating committee submitted an objection of legality to the Labour Inspectorate which conducted the requisite investigation in accordance with the prevailing administrative procedures; results were the same as those already mentioned, that is to say that the collective agreements cited by the enterprise were not in fact collective and consequently the Inspectorate established in Decision No.  of  November  (handed down by the Municipal Labour Inspector of Santiago Sur) that the workers in question could negotiate. Given this situation, Agrcola Arizta Ltda. lodged an application for protection with the Court of Appeal of San Miguel (collegiate, civil, ordinary court) against the Municipal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Sur. The Court of Appeal of San Miguel accepted the appeal and in a judgement dated  April  indicated in the part containing the verdict and sentence:' the application for protection lodged in record  by Agrcola Arizta Ltda. against the Municipal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Sur is accepted and its appeal against Decision No.  of  November  is declared null and void; the Inspectorate shall decide on the appropriate legal course of action with respect to the employer s observations concerning the draft collective contract submitted by company union No. .The Municipal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Sur lodged a remedy of appeal against the ruling of the Court of Appeal of San Miguel before the Supreme Court but, in a judgement dated  May , the Supreme Court upheld the appealed judgement of  April . On this point it should be noted that the judgement of the Court of Appeal of San Miguel reiterates what to date constitutes the majority opinion of the courts of justice in this matter; it considers that labour inspectorates are not competent to try or to rule on the legal nature of collective instruments, as it is the labour courts that have exclusive jurisdiction in this matter. Consequently the labour inspectorates, by ruling in the manner that the Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Sur did, would be encroaching on jurisdictional powers which, in the view of the courts, is illegal and arbitrary.
.The Government points out that in practice this judgement meant that the regulated negotiations of union No.  could not be concluded as the number of workers participating in the process was drastically reduced which obviously translated into a weakening of the negotiations and of the trade union organization. This organization had previously brought an action against the enterprise for unfair practices that infringed collective bargaining before the Second Labour Court of San Miguel, basing its action, among other things, on the situation relating to the existence of numerous collective agreements. In a judgement dated  January , the Court imposed a fine on Agrcola Arizta Ltda. Whereas clause No.  of the judgement establishes as follows:The actions of the defendant established in the above whereas clauses constitute an unfair practice that infringes upon collective bargaining as legally defined in article (d) of the Labour Code, that is  any arbitrary or abusive practice intended to restrict collective bargaining or render it impossible'  given the fact that as the workers were bound by a collective agreement in force they found themselves prevented from participating in any collective bargaining that might be initiated by the complainant trade union, having been pressurized into agreeing to conclude the agreements referred to, which demonstrates that said practice is the true intention of the employer when he proposes such instruments.Nevertheless, this judgement cited in the application for protection by the Labour Inspectorate of San Miguel, was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which in the fourth whereas clause of its judgement indicated that the matter of unfair practice in collective bargaining, the trying and punishing of which constitute a process which is regulated by the Labour Code, and infringements of constitutional guarantees that should be reviewed by way of applications for protection, were separate issues.
.Lastly, the Government states that all the information in the above paragraphs confirms that the enterprise s repeatedly observed conduct has led to a situation where there is practically no trade union activity within it. Currently union No.  has a very small number of members. Likewise, the enterprise has managed to eliminate collective bargaining, keeping the majority of its employees subject to collective agreements resulting from processes it controls itself. However, the fact that pressure was placed on the workers to sign the agreements presented by their employer has been recognized and explicitly established in the judicial decision of the Second Labour Court of San Miguel which censured the enterprise s unfair practices regarding collective bargaining, stating in its seventh whereas clause:The workers were pressurized in order to obtain their consent to sign the collective agreements under reference, either through the threat of dismissal or transfer to the general service section, with the corresponding reduction in their remuneration, or by offering them a sum of money for their signature, a situation which was acknowledged by the defence witnesses.From all the background information provided it can be seen without a shadow of a doubt that the enterprise Agrcola Arizta Ltda. has maintained an attitude of ongoing harassment vis--vis the trade union activity carried out in the enterprise, as demonstrated by the fact that at present only trade union No.  is in operation, while a further two trade union organizations have been in recess for a few years. The enterprise approaches collective bargaining in the same way; at present there are no collective instruments which have resulted from regulated negotiations but, on the contrary, the principal practice in the enterprise, and the practice which covers the majority of its workers, is that of collective agreements. It is important to point out that all the actions carefully and diligently carried out by the officials of the Labour Inspectorate, in the various bodies to which applications were made, have been unable to prevent or reduce the open persecution by Agrcola Arizta Ltda. of the trade union organizations, their officials and their activities, as seen in the case of the collective bargaining initiated by company union No. .
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant alleges that the enterprise Agrcola Arizta Ltda.: () obliges its workers to sign, under threat, instruments that it calls  collective labour agreements' which are in fact contracts of adhesion or multiple individual contracts (m.i.c.); () prevented company union No.  from negotiating a collective contract on behalf of  workers, arguing that  of them had already signed the abovementioned  collective agreements' (that is to say m.i.c.); and () pressurizes the workers who join the enterprise not to become members of the trade union and the workers who are affiliated to leave the trade union, which has led to  workers leaving the organization.
.As regards the allegation that the enterprise obliges its workers to sign, under threat, instruments that it calls  collective labour agreements' (that is to say m.i.c.), the Committee notes the Government s statement that numerous investigations have been carried out by the administrative authorities and that it has been repeatedly concluded that",2,2000,Chile
161,"the agreements cannot be classified as collective agreements resulting from negotiation as provided for in the Labour Code, given that the elements seen clearly reflect the lack of collective consent and of real participation in the supposed negotiations and that these agreements resemble  contracts of adhesion' which the workers are called upon to accept individually when offered a contractual proposal by the enterprise. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the Collective Agreements Recommendation,  (No. ), provides that:' for the purpose of this Recommendation, the term  collective agreements' means all agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more representative workers' organizations, or, in the absence of such organizations, the representatives of the workers duly elected and authorized by them in accordance with national laws and regulations, on the other.In this respect, the Committee emphasized that the said Recommendation stresses the role of workers' organizations as one of the parties in collective bargaining. Direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, bypassing representative organizations where these exist, might in certain cases be detrimental to the principle that negotiation between employers and organizations of workers should be encouraged and promoted [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the enterprise respects the principles of collective bargaining and in particular Article  of Convention No.  concerning the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation with workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend legislation to clearly prevent this type of practice of  multiple individual contracts' when there is a representative trade union and to see to it that direct negotiation with workers does not create difficulties for or weaken the position of trade unions.
.Concerning the alleged refusal by Agrcola Arizta Ltda. to negotiate with company union No.  a draft collective contract that covered  workers, arguing that  of them were covered by  collective agreements' in force (these were in fact  multiple individual contracts' , the Committee notes the Government s statement that: (i) the Labour Inspectorate concluded that the collective agreements cited by the enterprise were not actually collective agreements and that consequently the disputed workers could negotiate; (ii) the enterprise lodged an application for protection with the judicial authorities against the ruling of the Labour Inspectorate that was accepted (the Government indicates that the legal judgement reproduces the majority opinion of the courts of justice to the effect that labour inspectorates are not competent to try or to rule on the legal nature of collective instruments and specifically on whether in this particular case multiple individual contracts constituted a collective agreement or not; in other words this question should have been submitted to the competent judicial authority and not to the Inspectorate); and (iii) consequently, given the lack of authority of the Labour Inspectorate to rule on the matter, in practice the trade union could not conclude the negotiation of the collective contract as the number of workers able to participate in the collective negotiation process was drastically reduced. In this respect, the Committee observes that, irrespective of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the competent institutional body to decide on the legal nature of the collective instruments, in January  another judicial authority fined the enterprise for unfair practices in collective bargaining, stating that the workers were pressurized in order to obtain their consent to sign collective agreements (m.i.c.) either through the threat of dismissal or transfer to the general service section, with the corresponding reduction in their wage remuneration; or by offering them a sum of money to sign the documents. In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the enterprise s argument that  of the  workers covered by a draft collective agreement were already covered by collective agreements is contrary to the principle of good faith that should reign in negotiations between the parties. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to ensure that Agrcola Arizta Ltda. and its company union No.  participate in negotiations in good faith and do everything possible to reach agreement.
.As regards the allegation that Agrcola Arizta Ltda. pressurizes workers joining the enterprise not to become members of the trade union and workers who are affiliated to leave the trade union, resulting in  workers having left the organization, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the enterprise has maintained an attitude of ongoing harassment towards trade union activity, as demonstrated by the fact that union No.  is currently the only one in operation, while a further two trade union organizations have been in recess for a few years. According to the Government, all the actions carried out by the administrative authority in the various bodies to which applications were made have been unable either to prevent or reduce the open persecution by the enterprise of the trade union organizations, their officials and their activities, as seen in the case of the collective bargaining initiated by union No. . In this respect, while it deeply deplores the anti-union conduct of the enterprise in question established by the authorities which constitutes a clear violation of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Chile, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures necessary to end the violations of these Conventions and the acts of harassment against the enterprise trade unions, their officials and members and to take measures to punish those responsible.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the enterprise Agrcola Arizta Ltda. respects the principles of collective bargaining and in particular Article  of Convention No.  relating to the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation with workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend legislation to clearly prevent the practice of  multiple individual contracts' when there is a representative trade union and to see to it that direct negotiation with workers does not create difficulties for, or weaken the position of, trade unions.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that Agrcola Arizta Ltda. and its company union No.  participate in negotiations in good faith and do everything possible to reach agreement.(c) Deeply deploring the anti-union conduct of Agrcola Arizta Ltda., established by the authorities, which constitutes a clear violation of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Chile, the Committee requests the Government to take all measures necessary to end the violations of these Conventions and the acts of harassment against the enterprise trade unions, their officials and members and to take measures to punish those responsible.",2,2000,Chile
162,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  February  from the Confederation of Banking Trade Unions (CSB).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the Confederation of Banking Trade Unions (CSB), which is affiliated to the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT), alleges that the Chilean authorities have disregarded the principles of freedom of association and violated Convention No. , to the detriment of trade union autonomy and the free election of CUT officials, in that public officials were directly involved in funding the election campaigns of certain candidates in the CUT leadership elections. The CSB supplies an official document from the Under-Secretary of Labour to the Finance Minister stating that a trade union official had referred to a commitment by the Minister to provide assistance for trade union officials on their election visits to various regions in December . The document refers to nine trade union officials by name. This illicit procedure is one of a number of actions which resulted in several candidates not standing for election or withdrawing their candidatures. According to the CSB, the debate concerning the legitimacy and transparency of the election process is still continuing.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that the allegations are based on a communication dated  November  from the Under-Secretary of Labour to the Finance Minister requesting financial assistance for travel by Christian Democrat trade union officials during the CUT elections. The Government states that the letter in question was of a purely personal nature but that, owing to an administrative error, it was sent on official stationery and that, because of its purely personal nature, it in no way implied any commitment to the use of public funds, nor did it constitute government interference in the internal affairs of trade union organizations.
.The Government states that an internal inquiry established that, during November and December , the only travel in this context involved officials of the Under-Secretariat of Labour on official business, and that none of the trade union officials named in the communication referred to above undertook any trips at the expense of the Under-Secretariat. The Public Accounts Inspectorate of the Republic, a body that is independent of any state ministry, authority or department, and is responsible among other things for monitoring compliance with the Administrative Statutes, was informed of the inquiry. The Government recalls that the authority in question can carry out any inspections or inquiries that it may deem necessary and establishes the facts under investigation through administrative proceedings.
.The Government adds that on  August , the official inspector of the Public Accounts Inspectorate took a statement under oath from the official who had been Under-Secretary of Labour in , to the effect that the communication in question, which was published in El Metropolitano on  July , was purely personal in nature, that no reply to it was ever received from the Finance Minister, and that no public funds were involved, nor was there any payment of travel expenses on behalf of the trade union officials named in the communication. This information was also passed on to the Chamber of Deputies on  December last, and the authorities at the time reiterated that public funds were not used to benefit certain trade unionists.
.The Government concludes by stating that it has been the practice of governments to encourage the autonomous development of workers' and employers' organizations in order to create a channel for social dialogue and thereby implement economic and social policies intended to bring about both economic growth and social equity.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant has alleged that public officials were directly involved in funding the election campaigns of certain candidates in the CUT elections in December , in particular with regard to financial assistance for travel to different regions. The Committee notes the statements of the Government to the effect that the official document from the Under-Secretariat of Labour, on which the complainant bases its allegations, was a purely personal document which, owing to an administrative error, was sent on official stationery. The Committee also notes that according to the public accounts inspectorate of the Republic, public funds were not involved and travel expenses were not paid on behalf of the officials referred to by the complainant.
.While regretting the use of official stationery for personal communications on trade union matters by a government representative, the Committee considers that the case does not require further examination.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require further examination.",0,2000,Chile
163,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January  from the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT). The Government replied in its communication of  February .
.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January , the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT) explains that it had for a long time been calling for the ratification by Chile of ILO Conventions Nos.  and , which was finally achieved due mainly to the CUT. The CUT adds that on  January , the President of the Republic formally signed the instrument of ratification of Conventions Nos.  and  and others, which had been approved by the National Congress, in a formal ceremony. A number of trade union officials had been invited, including the National President of the CUT, Mr. Etiel Moraga Contreras, who was also invited in his capacity as President of Industrial Trade Union No.  of the company Codelco-Chile (Sewel y Mina, Divisin El Teniente). However, when Mr. Etiel Moraga Contreras attempted to enter the Presidential Residence where the ceremony was due to take place, he was prevented from entering and left the premises together with other trade union officials who left as a gesture of solidarity in the face of the affront. The discrimination and offensive treatment suffered by the CUT President was an insult not only to him as an individual, which would in itself be a grave offence, but was also an affront to the trade union which he represented and to all Chilean workers affiliated to the CUT.
.The CUT adds that no union leader was invited to represent the CUT at the formal signing ceremony in question. It would appear that, as far as the Government is concerned, the CUT does not exist, or has been removed from its list of social organizations.
.According to the CUT, this incident did not come about by chance or as a result of a regrettable oversight, as has been claimed by certain authorities; on the contrary, it reflects the treatment meted out by the Government in recent times to the CUT and other organizations, predominantly in the public sector. The CUT states that an executive committee and national president were elected in democratic and autonomous elections, and considers that the Government, in refusing to acknowledge the representative nature of the union, showed a deplorable lack of consistency and tolerance. According to the CUT, the organization's national President, as its lawful representative, is entitled to deal with public or private bodies in all matters relating to the objectives set out in its statutes. The CUT considers that the Government has restricted the right laid down in Article , paragraph , of ILO Convention No.  and has infringed the union's right of representation under the terms of the Labour Code. Lastly, the CUT, while acknowledging that the Labour Directorate has already issued the appropriate certification, requests the Government, through the authority invested in the President of the Republic, to formally recognize the union's executive committee and national President.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that on  January , the President of the Republic Mr. Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, at a ceremony in the Presidential Residence, signed the instrument of ratification of the fundamental Conventions Nos. , ,  and , which had been approved by the National Congress on  November . The signing ceremony took place in the Montt-Varas room in the presence of some  invited guests, including members of the Labour and Social Security Committees of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, Government representatives, industrialists, trade union officials, heads of NGOs, trade union and trade associations, labour advocates, representatives of the Industrial Relations Association and of the Chilean Society for Labour Law, labour representatives, academics and university professors of labour law, and representatives of international organizations.
.The Government adds that in December , the Office of the President sent out a large number of personal invitations for the signing ceremony. For that purpose, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security provided a list of people to be invited. The list included the following: (a)  Members of Parliament; (b)  Government representatives; (c)  senior officials of the Confederation of Production and Trade (employers); (d)  leaders of organizations affiliated to the Confederation of Production and Trade; (e) five directors of small enterprises representing CONUPIA; (f)  former leaders of the CUT; (g)  current leaders of the CUT; (h)  leaders of trade union federations and confederations in the Santiago Metropolitan Area and the Valparaso Region; (i)  leaders of the National Association of Treasury Employees (public sector); (j)  leaders of workers' associations; (k)  trade union presidents; (l)  representatives of NGOs, union and trade associations; (m)  labour advocates, representatives of the Industrial Relations Association and the Chilean Society for Labour Law; (n)  academics, university professors and representatives of international organizations. The final guest list contained  people.
.The Government explains further that Mr. Etiel Moraga Contreras was included in the list in his dual capacity as President of the CUT and head of a trade union, and that in view of the large number of invitations issued and the limited capacity of the Montt-Varas room in the Palace where the ceremony was to be held, the palace guards refused to allow anyone else to enter once the room was full. For that reason, a number of people apart from Mr. Etiel Moraga Contreras were unable to enter. They included Mr. William Thayer Arteaga (a former Minister of Labour and Social Security, former Rector of the Universidad Austral de Valdivia, former Senator and President of the Senate Labour Affairs Committee); Mr. Eduardo Loyola Osorio (formerly Under-Secretary of State for Labour, labour advocate, formerly Chilean representative on the Governing Body of the ILO, currently Vice-President of Human Resources, Codelco-Chile); Ms. Gladys Laedger (Head of Office for the Director of Labour Affairs), and others.
.The Government concludes by stating that there has never been any discrimination against Mr. Etiel Moraga Contreras, nor was he prohibited from entering the Government Palace.
.The Committee notes that the complainant (the CUT) is critical of the fact that its President was prevented from attending an official ceremony for the signing by the Government of Chile of the instrument of ratification of a number of ILO Conventions (Conventions Nos. , ,  and ) which had been approved by the National Congress. The complainant also claims that no senior official was invited to represent the CUT at the ceremony, and that the organizations' representativeness and that of its new executive committee, as well as its right of representation, have thereby been called into question.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements in which it () denies that there has been any discrimination against the CUT President or other persons; () states that  people were invited to the ceremony, including  former leaders and  current leaders of the CUT; () states that the Montt-Varas room where the ceremony took place and where some  invited guests had gathered was full and for that reason the guards did not allow anyone else to enter; and () explains that other guests apart from the CUT President remained outside.
.The Committee concludes that the fact that the President of the CUT and many other people were unable to attend the ceremony of signing the instrument of ratification of a number of ILO Conventions (including Conventions Nos.  and ) was the result of problems of organization, specifically, of the fact that the room used for the ceremony was not big enough to accommodate all the invited guests. The Committee particularly regrets the fact that the President of the CUT, an organization which for many years had called for the ratification of these Conventions, was unable to attend the ceremony as a result of the problems referred to, and trusts that it will be possible to prevent such problems arising in future. However, in the light of all the evidence available to it, and taking into account the fact that many other people were unable to enter the room where the ceremony was held, the Committee cannot confirm that there has been discrimination against the President of the CUT.
.As regards the allegation that the incident in question reflects the general treatment which the CUT has suffered in recent times, the Committee notes that the CUT makes no reference to any specific actions or attitudes directed against it. Under these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that the present case does not call for further examination.",0,1999,Chile
164,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Teachers' Association of Chile dated  November . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), or the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the Teachers' Association of Chile states that, with the return to democracy in Chile, since  a process has begun of restoring the rights lost by public servants during the preceding period of authoritarian government; this essentially took the form of increases in remuneration, which had seriously deteriorated during that period. Accordingly, in line with the commitments undertaken by the Government of that time in the context of its programme, a public sector committee was set up which met once a year and brought together representatives of the Government, on the one hand, and, on the other, leaders of the organizations representing the public sector and the Single Central Organization of Chilean Workers (CUT). Through frank and open dialogue, this committee reached agreements which were subsequently transformed into national legislation. These agreements were intended to introduce a general adjustment in the amount of remuneration and other benefits for public servants. In this respect, it should be pointed out that these agreements and the enactments in which they were subsequently enshrined were in effect for a period of one year. The complainant organization states that thus, over the years, the groundwork was laid for a collective bargaining process that was ultimately accepted, despite the fact that the ""ground rules"" according to which it was institutionalized, both as to form and to substance, had been called into question, in addition to the fact that the resulting salary increases had seemed inadequate.
.The complainant organization points out that, at the same time, sectoral agreements were concluded with the Government to meet the specific interests represented by each organization; both the spirit and the letter of these agreements were independent of and exceeded the general salary adjustments covering the CUT and the other organizations of public servants. In most cases these sectoral wage increases were preceded by industrial action. In  the Government unilaterally and arbitrarily changed the ""ground rules"" which it had itself accepted in previous agreements, by refusing to negotiate and submitting the general adjustment Bill to the National Congress without going through the bargaining procedures and mechanisms which had been understood as having been approved and given legitimacy by both sides.
.Specifically, the complainant organization alleges that on  October  the public sector organizations and the CUT sent the Government a memorandum setting forth the workers' claims and aspirations to be discussed in the  bargaining round. On  October , the Government, through the Ministries of Finance, Labour and Social Welfare and the Economy, issued an invitation to a double session on the following Monday,  October, from  a.m. to  p.m. and from . p.m. onwards in order to ""bring their positions closer together"" and explore possibilities of reaching an agreement on a general salary adjustment and holiday bonuses in the public sector. Immediately afterwards the Government stated that ""in view of the heavy legislative agenda and the lack of time available to process this Bill, it is necessary to send it next Tuesday in order for the general salary adjustment and holiday bonuses to enter into force on  December, which is the chief responsibility of the Government"". The complainant organization adds that the Government's claim that an agreement of such scope and importance could be signed after no more than  hours of negotiations was unrealistic. It states that the mechanism proposed by the Government placed an unacceptable imposition on the unions since, among other things, it meant that they would be forced not to reach an agreement but rather to accept or reject a rigid and inflexible proposal made by the authorities, within a bargaining period which did not allow them to consult their first-level organizations and thus infringed the elementary principles of freedom of association and trade union democracy. According to the trade union organization, it is obvious that the -hour period allowed by the Government to complete negotiations clearly shows its intention not to bargain and the fact that it had already made its decision, namely to submit the Bill on the general salary adjustment to the National Congress without the agreement of the public sector unions.
.The complainant organization alleges further that the bargaining rules have been changed. It points out that, as the Government stated in reply to its memorandum, up to  the components of the general salary adjustment were inflation or cost-of-living increases, productivity and what was known as the ""equity bonus"" (minimum level of redistributive social justice). In this case, however, the productivity variable was unilaterally eliminated, the reason given by the authorities being that it had already been negotiated in the agreements concluded with the sectoral organizations, which is an absolutely false, tendentious and malicious assertion. By way of example, the complainant organization cites act No. ,, containing the last agreement between the Teachers' Association of Chile and the government authorities. Section  of the Act provides that the special increase in remuneration for  ""will apply independently of the general pay adjustments established for the public sector"". What is more, section  of the same Act, concerning the pay increase for , does not refer to the public sector adjustment for that year or state that the increase was being granted as part of the latter. The complainant organization affirms that it is thus a recent Act of the Republic of Chile which refutes the authorities' claim that productivity was taken into account in the agreement that is faithfully reflected in the Act, since none of its provisions state that the above-mentioned special pay increase for teachers was granted as part of the general salary adjustment for the public sector as far as the productivity variable is concerned. What the Act does say is in fact the contrary, as is crystal clear from the use of the word ""independently"".
.The complainant organization alleges further that anti-union practices hindering the exercise of freedom of association have been carried out. It points out that sectoral bargaining by public servants has generally been accompanied by industrial action, in the legitimate exercise of the right to strike and other measures that were intended to demonstrate disagreement with the Government and which had no other aim but the defence of socio-economic interests.
.The complainant organization states that its attention was drawn to a confidential letter, No.  of  September , signed by the Under-Secretary of Labour and addressed to the regional representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, on the subject of negotiations under way with the National Association of Fiscal Employees (ANEF), the relevant part of which states as follows: ""The executive of the ANEF has announced a plan of industrial action calling for a general salary adjustment of  per cent in payment of the historical debt', among other demands; I would therefore like to have a weekly report on any action taken, messages and measures for the regional implementation of this industrial action plan"". The complainant organization states that this confidential letter not only points to an abuse of authority and indicates that the Under-Secretary of Labour has exceeded the powers conferred upon him by the internal regulatory framework but, most importantly, constitutes an act of unlawful and undue interference in the activities and functioning of trade unions.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states the following:
.() in a written note addressed to the President of the CUT on  October , the Ministers of Labour and Social Security, Finance and the Economy expressed their views and proposals in response to the ""Memorandum from the public sector to the Government concerning the  bargaining round"". This document, entitled ""Government proposal in response to the memorandum from the Single Central Organization of Workers to the Government concerning the process of determining salary adjustments and other benefits for "", contains the following economic proposals: (i) a general salary adjustment calculated on the basis of future inflation (. per cent) and supplemented by a factor of  per cent, totalling per cent; (ii) a proposal not to introduce any change in the minimum wage, since the new system of performance incentives brings about another increase in remuneration ; (iii)  university scholarships to be granted in ; (iv) the Government's housing policy is based on considerations of equity, which does not allow the introduction of social schemes; (v) the authorities consider that the higher education policy meets citizens' needs adequately, ruling out the introduction of other benefits; (vi) a Christmas bonus of , pesos for those earning less than , pesos and , pesos for those earning more than that amount; (vii) a",0,1997,Chile
165,"national holiday bonus of , and , pesos respectively, applying the same threshold of , pesos; (viii) an education grant of , pesos; (ix) , pesos per worker as a contribution to their welfare; and (x) a proposal to maintain the sectoral agreements that had already been reached. In view of the lack of time available, in the same note the Ministers invited the CUT leaders and public sector organizations ""to hold a double working meeting in the Ministry of Finance on Monday,  October from  a.m. to  p.m. and from . p.m. onwards, with a view to bringing their positions closer together and exploring the possibilities of reaching an agreement on a ""general salary adjustment and holiday bonuses in the public sector"". In view of the heavy legislative agenda and the lack of time available to process this Bill, it is necessary to send it next Tuesday in order for the general salary adjustment and holiday bonuses to enter into force on  December, which is the chief responsibility of the Government"". The Ministers went on to invite them to work and resume talks on the weekend (Saturday,  and Sunday,  October), if the union leaders were available, or on Monday,  October, according to the programme outlined above;
.As regards the allegation concerning unlawful interference by the Under-Secretary of Labour in the activities and functioning of public sector trade unions, in the form of a confidential letter, No.  of  September , the Government states that this letter contained instructions to officials under the authority of the Under-Secretary of Labour, namely the regional secretaries of the Ministry, of whom there are  nationwide. The Government points out that these instructions consisted in requesting information concerning the demands for pay adjustments made by the National Association of Fiscal Employees (ANEF) which were reportedly as high as  per cent. The Government states that the same officials were requested to circulate information at the regional level on the pay increases granted in the public administration since  and to announce the Government's willingness to launch a new stage in wage determination based on incentives or bonuses for individual and team performance by public servants. Lastly, the Government states that there have therefore not been any anti-union practices or interference in the activities of trade union organizations.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges certain defects in the collective bargaining process in the public sector, attributable to the administrative authorities, as well as a change in bargaining rules, namely the fact that the Government did not take productivity into account as a criterion in introducing salary increases for , contrary to previous practice. The Committee notes further that the complainant organization alleges that the administrative authorities engaged in anti-union practices in the form of a confidential letter sent to the regional secretaries of the Ministry of Labour.
.As regards the allegation concerning defects in the collective bargaining process in the public sector attributable to the administrative authorities, the Committee notes that, in its reply, the Government states the following: (i) on  October  the Under-Secretary of Labour addressed a written invitation to the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) to participate in the process of dialogue on labour and technical matters to determine the general salary adjustment and holiday bonuses in the public sector; (ii) on  October ,  public sector workers' organizations, coordinated by the CUT, addressed a memorandum to the authorities in which they set forth their economic demands; (iii) on  October the administrative authorities communicated in writing to the President of the CUT the Government's proposal in response to the CUT memorandum concerning the process of determining the salary adjustment and other benefits for ; (iv) on  October the meeting with the CUT and public sector organizations took place, but after several hours of discussion during which the sides presented their arguments, the workers' representatives did not yield on their original demand for pay adjustments; and (v) faced with the impossibility of reaching an agreement and taking into account the fact that the Bill on the general salary adjustment and holiday bonuses would have to be submitted to Parliament as a matter of urgency on  October  so as to enter into force on  December, the President of the Republic sent it for processing.
.In this respect, the Committee observes that the allegations of the complainant organization and the Government's reply indicate that a bargaining process was under way between the trade union organizations in the public sector and the authorities. However, the Committee observes that in this case the collective bargaining process for a salary adjustment in the public sector lasted for a period of five days -- from  to  October -- which, in the light of these circumstances, was inadequate, especially given the fact that the negotiations themselves (that is, once the trade union organization's proposals and the authorities' counter proposal had been put forward) lasted only one day ( October). In these conditions, the Committee considers that the public sector trade unions did not have sufficient time to negotiate on the salary adjustments for , which in this specific case is contrary to the spirit of collective bargaining. The Committee therefore requests the Government to ensure that in future sufficient advance notice is given to public sector trade union organizations when they are convened for collective bargaining, so as to allow them a reasonable period of time to negotiate their conditions of employment, especially in view of the fact that there are strict time-limits for submitting bills to Parliament.
.As regards the allegation concerning the change in bargaining rules, namely the fact that the Government did not take productivity into account as a criterion in determining salary increases for , contrary to previous practice, the Committee notes the Government's statement that: () the salary adjustment fixed for  is aimed at compensating for the expected price increase this year and supplements wage increases set forth in previous agreements; () under the combined effect of a general adjustment plus other sectoral adjustments, the average salary increase for public servants for  will reach  per cent in nominal terms; and () the key objectives of the labour policy pursued in the public sector are to establish an institutional framework for social dialogue and to introduce performance incentives in remuneration. In this respect, while the Committee observes that provision has been made for a salary increase for workers in the public sector in  and that a policy of introducing pay incentives is being implemented, it would emphasise that the determination of criteria to be applied by the parties in fixing wages (cost-of-living increases, productivity, etc.) is a matter for negotiation between the parties and it is not for the Committee to express an opinion on the criteria that should be applied in fixing pay adjustments. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the allegation concerning alleged anti-union practices committed by the administrative authority in the form of a confidential letter addressed to the regional secretaries of the Ministry of Labour (the content of which was reproduced in the allegations of the complainant organization), the Committee notes the Government's statement that the letter in question contained instructions to officials under the authority of the Under-Secretariat of Labour, requesting information concerning demands for pay adjustments made by the National Association of Fiscal Employees, and asking them to circulate information on the pay increases granted since  and the policy regarding the new round of wage fixing. In this respect, the Committee observes that the text of the confidential letter to which the complainant organization objected reflects the administrative authority's concern to be informed of ""action taken, messages and measures for the regional implementation of this industrial action plan"". In the view of the Committee, this letter could reflect the authority's concern for the industrial action to take place in accordance with the legislation, for example, by allowing them to take measures to organize minimum services in the event of a strike. Moreover, the text of the letter in question does not contain any indication of an intention to engage in undue interference in the trade union activities of public sector workers' organizations, neither does it order any measures to this effect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Considering that the trade union organizations of the public sector did not have sufficient time to negotiate on the salary adjustment for , which in this specific case is contrary to the spirit of collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that in future sufficient advance notice is given to public sector trade union organizations when they are convened for collective bargaining, so as to allow them a reasonable period of time to negotiate their conditions of employment, especially in view of the fact that there are strict time-limits for submitting",-1,1997,Chile

167,".At its meeting in November , the Committee examined allegations concerning the dismissal of the trade union leaders Mr. Sergio Antonio Cea Valenzuela, Mr. Sergio Silva Prez and Mr. Jorge Muoz Llanos of the security transport company Brink's of Chile S.A. The Government sent extensive documentation and details of the various court rulings rejecting these unionists' complaints and indicated that the ruling of the First Labour Tribunal of Valparaso, rejecting the evidence regarding their status as workers and trade union leaders, was under appeal. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal proceedings (see th Report, paras. ,  and ).
.In a communication dated  March , the Government stated that on  August , the Valparaso Court of Appeal rejected the application by Mr. Cea Valenzuela, Mr. Silva Prez and Mr. Muoz Llanos and upheld the lower court's ruling. On  September , the lawyers acting on behalf of the union leaders applied to the Valparaso Court of Appeal for clarification, expansion or correction of its ruling of  August , with a view to obtaining clarification on certain questionable points and rectifying certain errors which in their view the ruling contained. On  September , the Valparaso Court of Appeal rejected this application. On  September , the lawyers acting for the union leaders applied to the Supreme Court, through the Valparaso Court of Appeal, for a ruling to set aside the ruling of  August on the grounds that it was contradictory. On  October , the Supreme Court reviewed the application and ruled it to be inadmissible. On  November , the Supreme Court issued an implementation order in respect of the ruling handed down by the Court of Appeal, which thus became an enforceable judgement against which no further appeals could be made.
.The Committee takes note of this information and of the contents of the court rulings according to which the persons concerned did not have the status of trade union leaders at the time of their dismissals and consequently did not enjoy special protection.
.In a previous examination of the case (see th Report, paras. -, adopted by the Governing Body at its March  (st) Session), certain allegations remained pending with regard to the dismissal of, or legal proceedings instituted against, trade union leaders. On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):-- With regard to the dismissal, without court authorization, of trade union leaders in Rhona SA (Mr. Araos Herrera) and Brink's (Messrs. Cea Valenzuela, Silva Prez and Muoz Llanos) and, given that Chilean legislation requires prior court authorization for the dismissal of trade union leaders and that such authorization was not sought in the present case, the Committee deplores the dismissal of the four trade unionists listed by the complainant and urges the Government immediately to take measures for their reinstatement. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the current legal action.-- Regarding the clearance of the Senate chambers, the temporary detention of Luis Pereira, Nicols Soto and Luis Mesina, trade union leaders, and the initiation of criminal action against them on ""contempt of authority"" charges, the Committee, whilst noting the Government's statement that these facts were provoked by ""gross"" insults directed at certain senators during the debate on a Bill as well as by disorderly behaviour designed to interrupt the speakers, requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the current action taken against these union leaders.
.In its communication dated  July , the Government states that Mr. Eduardo Araos Herrera and Rhona SA came to a settlement in the case before the Labour Tribunal of Via del Mar; in accordance with this agreement, the enterprise paid all of the employment benefits which had been the subject of the action (US$,) and Mr. Araos Herrera renounced his employment and any other legal action in connection with the employment relationship between the two parties. With regard to the dismissals of the trade union leaders, namely Messrs. Sergio Antonio Cea Valenzuela, Sergio Silva and Jorge Muoz, the Government forwarded extensive documentation and details regarding the various court decisions rejecting these unionists' complaints and indicates that the ruling handed down by the First Labour Tribunal of Valparaso, rejecting the evidence regarding their status as workers and trade union leaders, is at present under appeal. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal proceedings.
.With regard to the detention and prosecution on charges of ""contempt of authority"" of the leaders of the Confederation of Bank Employees' Trade Unions, Messrs. Luis Pereira Concha, Nicols Soto Reyes and Luis Mesina Marn, the Government reports that the proceedings have been stayed and, consequently, no sentence has been pronounced. The Committee takes note of this information.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  November .
.The Government sent observations in a letter of  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that on  July  the electricity company Rhona S.A. unilaterally terminated the contract of employment that it had with Mr. Eduardo Araos Herrera, Secretary of the Rhona S.A. National Union and Treasurer of the Metal Workers' Federation (FETEM). According to the ICFTU, this dismissal constitutes a serious violation of the provisions regarding workers' immunity established in the labour law of Chile and, consequently, the relevant trade union organizations instituted legal proceedings with a view to reversing the dismissal; at the same time they submitted a complaint to the labour administration in order to gain the union leader's reinstatement. Nevertheless, the judicial bodies and administrative authorities were overruled by the defiant attitude of Rhona S.A. officials who refused to implement the decisions taken by the National Labour Office which called for the reinstatement of the unfairly dismissed union leader. The ICFTU also alleges that Messrs. Sergio Cea Valenzuela, Sergio Silva Prez and Jorge Muoz Llanos, trade union leaders in Brink's of Chile, were unjustly dismissed -- despite trade union immunity -- on account of their action to establish a trade union within their company.
.Moreover, the ICFTU alleges that when the Confederation of Bank Employees' Trade Unions organized a day of protest on  May  in the Senate of the Republic as a show of that sector's disagreement with the Bill seeking to extend workdays to Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, the workers were forcibly removed and, subsequently, Luis Pereira, Nicols Soto and Luis Mesina, trade union leaders, were detained. These leaders were then released; however, the Senate initiated unprecedented criminal action against them on grounds of ""contempt of authority""; they are thus currently the subject of judicial proceedings despite the repeated calls by trade unions and social organizations for the charges to be dropped.
.In its letter of  February , the Government states that Mr. Eduardo Araos Herrera, leader of the Rhona S.A. union and of the Metal Workers' Federation (FETEM), was indeed dismissed by his employer without the relevant tribunal's prior authorization having been obtained, as stipulated by article  of the Labour Code. The employer justified the dismissal by stating that on the date of termination the worker was not a trade union leader. Officials of the labour inspectorate of Via del Mar visited Rhona S.A. and instructed the employer to reinstate the worker and to fulfil all contractual obligations. Nevertheless, the company did not comply with the labour inspectors' instructions and declined to reinstate the worker. Given the circumstances, the trade union leader took the case to the competent labour tribunal, seeking the reversal of his dismissal and, therefore, reinstatement in the company. The case is at present before the Labour Tribunal of Via del Mar.
.With regard to the dismissal of Messrs. Sergio Cea Valenzuela, Sergio Silva Prez and Jorge Muoz Llanos, leaders of the Union of Employees of Brink's of Chile, V Region, the Government indicates that the said union was established on  May  and elected the aforementioned leaders. The company refused to accredit them and proceeded to dismiss them. The Government adds that, in view of the fact that these workers enjoy trade union immunity and that the company had not obtained the competent labour tribunal's prior authorization of dismissal, the Labour Inspectorate of Via del Mar visited Brink's of Chile, V Region, and instructed it to reinstate these workers. The company did not comply with the labour inspectors' instructions; the inspectorate subsequently imposed money fines. Given this situation, the workers instituted judicial proceedings on grounds of ""anti-trade union practices"" before the Labour Tribunal of Via del Mar. The case was declared receivable and a judgement was passed in their favour on  September . However, the company appealed to the High Court (Court of",-1,1997,Chile
168,"Appeal) which declared the former judgement null and void and ordered postponement of the proceedings for the purposes of preliminary investigation as requested by the company. The case is at present under examination before the First Labour Tribunal of Valparaso.
.The Government indicates that the Labour Office, as well as the labour inspectorate attached to it, have no legal powers to enforce its decisions. Their powers permit them only to apply money fines. It is labour tribunals which are competent, following regular legal proceedings heard by them, to order the reinstatement of dismissed workers enjoying trade union immunity.
.In connection with the detention and prosecution for ""contempt of authority"" of leaders of the Confederation of Bank Employees' Trade Unions, Messrs. Luis Pereira Concha, Nicols Soto Reyes and Luis Mesina Marn, the Government states that it consulted the Senate of the Republic (branch of the legislature); its President declared the following on  October :-- The Senate of Chile, in keeping with its traditional tolerance of the opinions voiced in debate as well as favouring publicity of its proceedings, admits the presence in its chambers of any person wishing to attend its sessions and to become acquainted with the range of opinion; this rule applies generally and indefinitely with certain exceptions applying to private sessions.-- Presence in the public gallery naturally implies that persons shall refrain from demonstrations: in the event of such action, the presiding member shall exercise his/her powers to maintain order. For that purpose, article () of the Standing Orders of the Senate empowers him/her to summon the assistance of the police, to order that the galleries be cleared and ""to place in court custody the person instigating disorder on any part of the premises"".-- The above-mentioned powers ensue from three legal texts, two of which are contained in the Penal Code of Chile, and which have been in force without amendment since  March ; they term as offences certain forms of conduct affecting the legislative bodies, their committees or senators/parliamentarians. Article  provides for punishment of whomsoever, in word or deed, insults any of the legislative bodies or their committees, be it at public meetings attended by them or in the exercise of their various responsibilities. Article  states that ""whosoever seriously disrupts order at sittings of the legislative bodies or whosoever adopts insulting or threatening behaviour at such meetings towards any parliamentarian or senator"" or, similarly, whosoever insults or threatens a senator or parliamentarian in connection with the opinions he/she has voiced in Congress shall be guilty of contempt of authority (first paragraph, Nos.  and ).-- The State Security Act, No. , of  August , states in article (b), that it is an offence against public order to slander, insult or libel senators or parliamentarians, independently of whether the defamation, insult or libel is associated or not with the exercise of the offended party's functions.-- The same State Security Act stipulates, in article , that the judicial body competent to examine the offences addressed, inter alia, by the aforementioned three articles, is the Court of Appeal.-- In order to present the facts prompting the action subsequently instituted by the Senate in the relevant courts, we quote the version given by the Vice-President of the House, the Honourable Senator, Mr. Eugenio Cantuarias, before the judge trying the case:On Tuesday,  May , the Senate was sitting in afternoon session with a large attendance in the public gallery. The debate centred on the Bill to amend the General Banks Act, ...During the statements by certain senators, several demonstrations broke out in the public gallery ... there was applause, mockery or insults which prompted me as acting President of the Senate to recall that demonstrations were not permitted. Nevertheless, ... the disruption became so serious that I was obliged to suspend the proceedings in order to allow the police to clear the gallery and, subsequently, to pursue the sitting without further interruption.I must point out to Your Worship that the vocabulary uttered included words ... directed principally at certain senators including ... and that the behaviour designed to interrupt the speakers consisted of the shouting of slogans and the hurling of various objects from the gallery into the Senate Hall ...The police officials (Carabineros de Chile) in attendance on the premises and who cleared the gallery ... identified the main persons responsible for this disruption and the above-mentioned abuse as being Messrs. Nicols Soto Reyes, Luis Fernando Mesina Marn and Luis Armando Pereira Concha ...-- As can be appreciated, the action instituted by the Senate complies strictly with the relevant legal provisions and regulations; it is aimed solely at protecting its dignity and due respect. No committed defender of the democratic institutions will hesitate to feel objectively concerned by the facts described above, independently of the perpetrators' motives. Consequently, the Senate simply called upon an entirely impartial body, the competent court of law, to investigate the facts and determine whether they constitute any of the aforementioned offences and, in that eventuality, establish the relevant liabilities.-- In respect of the proceedings instituted at the Senate's behest versus the trade union leaders of the Confederation of Bank Employees' Trade Unions, this action is in accordance with Roll No. - and the case is at present under investigation by a minister of the Court of Appeal of Valparaso (Civil and Collegiate Court). None of these trade unionists is in detention at this time and enjoy full freedoms.
.Finally, the Government indicates that any further factors coming to light shall be notified in due course.
.With regard to the dismissal, despite trade union immunity, of trade union leaders in the Rhona S.A. enterprise (Mr. Araos Herrera) and Brink's (Messrs. Cea Valenzuela, Silva Prez and Muoz Llanos), the Committee notes that the labour inspectorate instructed the respective employers to reinstate the above-mentioned workers, that the employers refused to do so and that, consequently, legal action was initiated with a view to the reinstatement of the dismissed persons and that such action is at present sub judice. In this regard, given that Chilean legislation requires prior judicial authorization for the dismissal of trade union leaders and that it was not sought in the present case, the Committee deplores the dismissal of the four trade unionists listed by the complainant and recalls that no one should be the subject of discrimination in employment on account of trade union membership or legitimate union functions and activities. The Committee recalls that cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and in particular a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned. (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. .) In this respect, the Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary measures for the reinstatement in their posts of the four trade unionists listed by the complainant. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the current legal action.
.Regarding the action to clear the Senate chambers and the detention of Luis Pereira, Nicols Soto and Luis Mesina, trade union leaders, as well as the criminal proceedings instituted against them on ""contempt of authority"" charges, the Committee has noted that, at present, these three trade union leaders are free and are awaiting the outcome of the court action. The Committee notes that, according to the Government and the report submitted by the President of the Senate, the action to clear the chambers, the detention and the initiation of criminal proceedings against them were due to repeated ""gross"" insults directed at certain senators during the debate on a Bill as well as due to disorderly behaviour designed to interrupt the speakers, despite warnings issued by the President of the Senate. In this regard, the Committee recalls that, in exercising their freedom of expression and in expressing their opinions, ""trade union organizations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the current action against these trade union leaders.",-1,1997,Chile
169,".The complaint in this case appears in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) of September . The Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of September , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) recalls that in September  a coup d'tat overthrew the democratically elected Government of President Salvador Allende. The military junta which took over power dissolved the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) and the federations in the metal, mining and textile industries, amongst others. All their property (trade union premises, assets and income) was immediately confiscated. The complainant adds that in October , the dictatorship once again declared illegal certain occupational federations, whose income, assets and premises were once again confiscated.
.The complainant states that after , the CUT reached a compromise with the opposition parties which had re-emerged as a result of the struggles by the workers, whereby with the restoration of democracy all the assets and resources confiscated during the dictatorship would be returned to the trade union movement, and the bank accounts of the above-mentioned federations which had been frozen from  would be unblocked. The complainant adds that during the Government of President Alwyn the CUT was provided, on the basis of a free loan, with premises situated in Moneda numero  as well as other provincial premises. Subsequently, a Bill was presented for the restitution of confiscated assets but it was rejected due to a lack of votes. The complainant points out that the present Government presented another Bill which has made no headway in Congress because it has not been given urgent attention, and that in accordance with national parliamentary procedure it is the Government which must determine the urgency of each piece of proposed legislation. Finally, the complainant states that there is a lack of interest and will on the part of the Government to resolve the dispute.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that by means of Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  of , and  of , the legal personality of various trade union organizations and occupational associations was cancelled and these bodies dissolved, with their assets passing to their legal successors or to the State. In , the Ministry of National Property brought before Parliament a Bill on the ""restitution or compensation of assets confiscated or acquired by the State by means of Legislative Decrees Nos. ,  and  of ;  of  and  of "", the substance of which had already been discussed and adopted by the Chamber of Deputies and recently by the Senate. The final adoption of these texts is expected during the first half of this year. The Government states that this Bill, which consists of  permanent and two transitory sections, establishes a time-limit of one year following its entry into force for individuals, trade union organizations, political parties and legal persons concerned to claim the restitution of the confiscated assets. In the event that these assets cannot be returned, either because they have been sold or because the State decides to keep them since they are used for public services, the respective cash compensation shall be paid. Under the law, it is expected that restitutions for an amount of around , million pesos (approximately  million dollars), corresponding to  properties, will be made. Of these,  belonged to individuals,  to political parties,  to trade union organizations and  to legal persons. Of the  pieces of property,  had been transferred and were no longer part of the Treasury assets, and  are still in the power of the State.
.The Government adds that as part of the procedure governing the above-mentioned Bill, the Ministry of National Property drew up a list of the buildings confiscated from trade union organizations, in accordance with the reports provided by the parties concerned. (The Government includes a list of these buildings.) The Government states that the situation of these buildings is as follows: (i) eight were incorporated into the Treasury assets and subsequently transferred free of charge or sold directly to various institutions and individuals; (ii) one was transferred free of charge to the CUT; (iii) seven properties are still registered in the name of the Treasury, some of which are used by state bodies for their own purposes; (iv) no information is available on the present legal situation of three properties; and (v) two properties are not recorded as belonging to the Treasury.
.The Government specifies that as a means of compensating the loss of the properties transferred to the Treasury as a result of the legislation issued under the military Government, which affected the Single Central Organization of Workers and other trade union bodies, the Ministry of National Property, after the establishment of the democratic Government, granted them usage free of charge of  properties throughout the country and has transferred free of charge two buildings in the Bobo region. (The Government includes in its reply a list of the buildings in respect of which the Single Central Organization of Workers has been awarded a grant of free usage or which have been transferred to the CUT free of charge.)
.The Committee notes in this case that the complainant alleges the non-restitution of assets confiscated from the Single Central Organization of Workers and other trade union organizations following the coup d'tat which occurred in Chile in . More specifically, the complainant states that although a Bill has been placed before Congress providing for the restitution of trade union assets, its adoption has been delayed since the Government has not made it a matter of urgency.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government, in  the Ministry of National Property placed before Congress a Bill on the restitution or compensation of assets confiscated or acquired by the State, which was discussed and adopted by the Chamber of Deputies and by the Senate, and the final adoption of which is expected during the first half of this year. The Committee furthermore notes that the Government states that the Bill in question establishes a time-limit of one year for individuals, trade union organizations, political parties and legal persons concerned to claim the restitution of the confiscated assets, and also provides that in the event that the assets cannot be returned, a corresponding cash compensation will be paid. In the same way, the Government notes with interest that according to the Government, as a means of compensating the loss of the property transferred to the public Treasury, which affected the Single Central Organization of Workers and other trade union bodies, under legislation issued by the military Government, the Ministry of National Property, following the establishment of the democratic Government, has made  grants of free usage by the CUT of buildings throughout the country and has transferred to it free of charge two buildings in the Bobo region.
.In this respect, the Committee recalls that the Fact-finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association set up in , after the change of regime, had requested the adoption of measures with a view to the restitution to trade union organizations of the assets to which they were entitled (see Trade union situation in Chile, , paragraph ).
.Considering that the CUT assets were confiscated almost  years ago, the Committee expresses its concern over this situation. The Committee also regrets that after seven years, the Bill concerning the restitution of confiscated trade union assets, which was placed before Congress in , has still not been finally adopted. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures so that the text in question, which has already been adopted by the Chamber of Deputies and by the Senate, can enter into force without delay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures so that the Act on the restitution or compensation of assets confiscated from the trade union organizations can enter into force without delay and requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken in this respect.",0,1997,Chile
170,".The complaint in this case is contained in communications from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries (UITBB) dated  January and  April . This organization subsequently sent additional information in a communication dated  May . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  October,  and  November  and  January and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  January and  April , the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries (UITBB) alleges that two workers employed in the IMS consortium died accidentally on  January  as the result of the collapse of a slope in a tunnel in which no protection on safety measures had been taken. The complainant organization states that the National Confederation of Trade Unions of Workers in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities (CNTC) had denounced the precarious occupational safety and health conditions which existed at this worksite, but that no attention was given to this appeal by the enterprise's management, the respective ministries or the administration of the underground railway.
.The complainant organization adds that in May  the enterprise management dismissed numerous workers who had participated in a brief work stoppage in support of their claims concerning wages and occupational safety and health, and that after this incident, the enterprise management systematically abolished the trade union organization which the workers had set up.
.Furthermore, the complainant organization states that ""there is no right to collective bargaining"" for building workers. Finally, the complainant organization points out that there is a permanent attitude of aggression towards workers' organizations and that ""as a corollary to the firm defence and promotion of workers' claims in the IMS enterprise, the latter initiated action contrary to any sense of ethics, and that the Government, which in various ways is encouraging the development of trade unionism controlled by employers, is also responsible for this"". The complainant organization alleges that so-called guards are recruited by the enterprise for the purpose of preventing or neutralizing activity by trade union leaders or officials and that the President of the CNTC, Mr. Adrin Fuentes Hermosilla, was threatened and prevented from entering the worksite.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states in connection with the alleged systematic liquidation of the trade union organization that the Labour Directorate has reviewed the records concerning the trade union organizations set up in the building contractor enterprises for line  of the metropolitan underground railway of Santiago and was able to establish the existence of the Trade Union of Workers of the building enterprise IMS Ltda., set up on  May , which re-elected its officers following the resignation of its previous directors on  February .
.As for the occupational accident that cost the lives of two workers on  January  in construction section D of line  of the metropolitan underground railway (the collapse of the west slope of the worksite in which Vctor Hugo Oate and Juan Ramn Moraga Muoz died), the Government states that as soon as the Labour Services were notified of the accident they immediately sent officials to the worksite to verify what had happened, who promptly took all possible measures to ensure compliance with safety standards. After a visual inspection, work in section D was immediately suspended due to the imminent danger to the health and lives of the workers in light of further possible collapses. The suspension affected the work of the building contractor enterprise IMS Ltda., the mandator of which is Metro SA, which in turn is responsible for the design of the above-mentioned works. Prior to this accident there had been no denunciations of safety problems.
.The Government adds that the Labour Services immediately requested reports from various technical bodies (Metropolitan Enterprise of Sanitary Works, National Geology and Mining Service, Governor's Office of the Metropolitan Region) as well as technical reports on the investigation of the accident from the mandator enterprise Metro SA, and the Safety Mutual Insurance Society, a body responsible for accident prevention in the works of the enterprise and the social security administrator in respect of occupational accidents and diseases. Cooperation was also requested from the Ministry of Public Works, which appointed two engineers in ground mechanics. On the basis of these reports, and in particular the instructions given by the mandator Metro SA for a reduction in the inclination of the slope and the construction of a step to reduce the height of the slope from  to  metres, and the report of the engineers of the Ministry of Public Works, which indicated that the proposed measures were sufficient to eliminate the imminent danger to the health or lives of the workers which had given rise to the suspension of work. Resolutions were issued which at first partially lifted the suspension placed on the works, to enable repairs to be carried out and, once the danger had ceased, lifted the general suspension affecting section D. Thus, work was suspended until  February . Finally, the Government states that as a result of these unfortunate events, the Labour Directorate concluded an agreement on the inspection of public works with the Ministry of Public Works, which is currently in the implementation stage. In the same way, the work of the Labour Directorate and the Metropolitan Environmental Health Service is being coordinated, and together they will deal with the subjects of occupational safety and health, and in particular serious fatal accidents. The Government states that at present a Bill is before the Senate of the Republic which will broaden the powers of the Labour Directorate in the inspection of occupational safety and health.
.In its communications dated  and  November ,  January and  May , the Government refers to the allegations of the dismissal of workers from the IMS building enterprise in May , on which it provides the following information:In May  the IMS Ltda. building enterprise dismissed  workers who were employed on line  of the Santiago underground. The grounds given for terminating the contract in  cases was that set out in section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, which reads as follows: ""Notwithstanding the provisions contained in the foregoing sections, an employer may terminate a contract of employment on grounds of the requirements of the enterprise, establishment or service, such as those deriving from their streamlining or modernization, drops in productivity, changes in the conditions of the market or of the economy, which render necessary the separation of one or more workers, or the fact that the employee's work or skills are not suited to his or her task.""The other  workers whose contracts were terminated were dismissed on the grounds set out in section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, which states: ""The contract of employment shall terminate without the employee being entitled to any compensation when the employer terminates it for one or more of the following reasons: ... desertion by the employee of his post without due cause for two consecutive days, two Mondays in the month or a total of three days during the same period of time; similarly, the unjustified absence, or absence without prior notice, of an employee responsible for an activity, job or machine whose abandonment or stoppage entails a serious disruption in the running of the operation.""The Labour Services have no record of workers being dismissed as a reprisal for their setting up a trade union, nor have they any information about the incident described as a ""brief work stoppage"" by workers at the IMS enterprise in May . Dismissals can be contested before the labour courts.
.Turning to the alleged non-existence of the right to collective bargaining for construction workers, the Government states that section  of the Labour Code provides as follows: ""The following shall not be permitted to bargain collectively: () workers who are parties to contracts of apprenticeship and workers engaged exclusively for a specified temporary or seasonal project or job."" The Government states that in practice, however, in cases of large-scale work which may be of a temporary nature, collective agreements have been concluded which have led to a substantial improvement in the benefits granted on an individual basis. This situation is the case in the building enterprise IMS Ltda., where a collective agreement was signed with the mediation of the regional authorities of the Labour Services on  March  by means of unregulated or voluntary collective bargaining. The Government states that in January  it submitted a Bill to the National Congress establishing a collective bargaining procedure for the trade unions of temporary or seasonal workers.
.With respect to the supposed threats against the President of the National Confederation of Trade Unions of Workers of Building, Wood Building Materials and Related Activities of Chile, Mr.",0,1995,Chile
171,"Adrin Fuentes Hermosilla, the Government states that the Labour Services have received no denunciations or complaints and that the Penal Code provides severe penalties for those who issue threats. Likewise, concerning the alleged encouragement given to the development of trade unionism controlled by employers which disregards the true interests of the workers, the Government emphasizes its support of the principle of trade union autonomy and states that the Labour Services have no information available to confirm such allegations; under the provisions of sections  to  of the Labour Code, any party may denounce anti-trade union or unfair practice to the labour courts, which are empowered to investigate and to order the redress or modification of acts which constitute unfair practice, and may even apply substantial fines. Finally, the Government states that a Bill has been submitted to the National Congress which will broaden protection against anti-trade union dismissal.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges: () the dismissal of a number of workers in May  from the IMS building enterprise after they held a brief work stoppage in support of their claims concerning wages and occupational safety and health; () the impossibility for construction workers to bargain collectively; () the accidental death of two workers during the construction of line  of the metropolitan underground railway being carried out by the IMS enterprise; () the presence of guards recruited by the enterprise to prevent or neutralize activity by trade union leaders or officials and the threats against the President of the CNTC who was barred from entering the worksite; and () the encouragement given by the Government to the development of trade unionism controlled by employers.
.As regards the allegation relating to the dismissal of a number of workers from the IMS building enterprise in May  after they had held a brief work stoppage in support of their claims concerning wages, occupational safety and health, and the subsequent attempt to systematically abolish the trade union organization of the IMS enterprise, the Committee observes that the Government in its reply refers to  dismissals in May  ( workers were dismissed in May  on the grounds set out in section , paragraph , of the Labour Code - requirements of the enterprise, streamlining, changes in the economy, etc. - and  others on the grounds set out in section , paragraph  - desertion of the employee's post without due cause). The Committee also notes that the Government has no record of the brief work stoppage referred to by the complainant and underlines the right of those dismissed to take legal action. In this regard, given that the Government has not indicated the concrete reasons for the various dismissals and has simply indicated the legal grounds for dismissal invoked by the enterprise, the Committee considers that there is evidence that these dismissals were more than likely of an anti-trade union nature. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls as a general point that respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that workers should not be dismissed for engaging in legitimate trade union activities and therefore requests the Government to take measures for the reinstatement of the workers concerned as far as still possible. The Committee notes that the Government has submitted to Congress a Bill which will broaden protection against acts of anti-trade union discrimination and requests the Government to keep it informed of how the submission procedure progresses.
.Turning to the allegation that under the Labour Code it is impossible for temporary workers to bargain collectively, the Committee notes that the Government states that in spite of the provisions of the Labour Code, in practice collective agreements have been concluded - independently of the provisions of the Labour Code - in large-scale worksites and that this was the case in the IMS enterprise, where a collective agreement was concluded in March , with the mediation of the regional authorities of the Labour Services. The Committee similarly notes that the Government has submitted a Bill to the National Congress establishing a concrete collective bargaining procedure for the trade unions of temporary workers. The Committee recalls that these workers should be able to negotiate collectively and requests the Government to keep it informed of how the submission of this Bill progresses.
.With respect to the accidental death of two workers during the construction of line  of the metropolitan underground railway being carried out by the IMS enterprise, the Committee notes the Government's statement that various measures were taken following the accident to eliminate dangers to the health or lives of workers (visual inspection, suspension of work, request for reports from technical bodies, etc.). In this connection, the Committee recalls that it is not for it to rule on issues concerning occupational safety and health.
.As for the allegations concerning: () the presence of guards recruited by the IMS enterprise to prevent or neutralize trade union activity and the threats made against the President of the CNTC, Mr. Adrin Fuentes Hermosilla; and () the encouragement given by the Government to the development of trade unionism controlled by employers, the Committee takes due note of the Government's declaration that the Labour Services have no information to confirm these allegations and that, under the provisions of the Labour Code (sections  to ) any party may denounce anti-trade union or unfair practice to the labour courts or submit a complaint to the criminal courts in the event of threats. Given this situation, the Committee can only observe that the allegations made by the complainant organization are very vague and that it has not provided any additional details in spite of having been invited to do so.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary so that, as far as still possible, the workers dismissed from the IMS building enterprise following a work stoppage in May  be reinstated.(b) With respect to the allegations concerning collective bargaining in the construction sector and anti-trade union dismissals, the Committee takes note of the Bills submitted by the Government to the National Congress relating to the right of temporary workers to bargain collectively and the broadening of protection against anti-trade union discrimination.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all progress made in connection with these Bills.",2,1995,Chile
172,".In a communication received by the Office on  April , the National Federation of Health Workers (FENATS) presented a complaint of violation of freedom of association against the Government of Chile. The Government furnished its comments and observations on the matter in a letter dated  September .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), nor the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.The FENATS denounces the fact that Mrs. Graciela Cruz Farias, the national leader of this trade union federation and leader also of the eighth region in which she is active in this capacity at the Concepcin Hospital, has been subjected - the federation maintains - to persecution on anti-union grounds.
.The complainant federation states that it covers , public health employees whose legal status, however, prevents them from forming a trade union. The FENATS explains that the Chilean Government has nevertheless drafted a Bill that will be submitted to Congress with a view to guaranteeing these workers the right to organize. It adds that because of the problem of their legal status, these state workers have set up corporations and associations by virtue of the right of association proclaimed in the Constitution. The complainant federation adds that it is a corporation affiliated to the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT), which supports this complaint.
.As regards the substance of the case, the FENATS states that on  February  the trade union leader in question was dismissed from her post in the public service by an internal administrative disciplinary measure which was not a court ruling and in which no civil or labour court had been involved. The dismissal was made on the grounds of ""repeated lateness and misdemeanours"" in the service because the trade union leader in question availed herself of the facilities that the Ministry of Health, in Circular No. A- of , granted to the leaders of public-sector corporative organizations; the content of the circular has frequently been referred to by the President of the Republic.
.According to the complainant federation, this disciplinary measure constitutes anti-union persecution against this leader who has constantly been subjected to harassment and attacks by the director of the Concepcin-Arauco health service, who dismissed her to prevent her from carrying out her duties as a trade union representative. The complainant federation adds that statements have been made by public employees affiliated to it according to which the director in question had, on several occasions, harassed Mrs. Cruz Farias both in her work as a public employee and in her trade union work. In November  he dismissed her because, in her capacity as a FENATS leader, she had publicly supported human rights activities. However, the director was ordered by the then senior authority to reinstate her the next day. When the national executive of the FENATS was apprised of the situation, it approached the competent authorities with a view to ending the persecution to which she had been subjected. Following the disciplinary measure against her, the federation's members at the regional level had organized a work stoppage in solidarity with her.
.The complainant federation concludes by stating that the Bill concerning the freedom of association of public employees and the regulation of time off for trade union purposes has been submitted to Congress and that the President of the Republic has requested the directors of public services to grant trade union leaders facilities in respect of working hours. The Ministry of Health has also issued instructions to this effect. The fact that non-compliance with the obligation to be present at work was invoked as grounds for dismissing Mrs. Cruz Farias is in total contradiction with the standards laid down by the government authorities in respect of permission for trade union leaders to take time off. Consequently, the FENATS considers that the facts constitute an infringement of freedom of association, an essential element of which is the independence of trade union leaders, and that the situation giving rise to the complaint is of a very serious nature in a country that won back democracy with the active participation of workers' organizations.
.The FENATS trusts that the Committee on Freedom of Association will ask the Government to take measures to have this public employee reinstated.
.In its reply of  September , the Government explains that the FENATS is an association governed by private law which acquired legal status in , in accordance with section  of Decree No.  of  but that it cannot pursue trade union objectives and comes under the Ministry of Justice and not the Ministry of Labour.
.This situation stems from the fact that state employees, because of the ban on union membership that entailed in the administrative rules governing public employees, have to resort to types of associations that differ from those to which they would belong if they enjoyed the right to organize. The rules in question, approved by Act No. . and published in the Official Gazette of  September , were adopted by the previous government. Section  of the Act provides that public employees may not: () organize or join trade unions within the framework of the state administration; and () direct, promote or take part in strikes, interruptions of activity or total or partial work stoppages by preventing people from working or machinery from operating, or otherwise disturb the normal functioning of the bodies of the state administration.
.Reconsidering the situation whereby public sector workers are discriminated against compared with those in the private sector from the point of view of the right to organize, President Aylwin's Government has submitted to Congress a Bill containing regulations in respect of associations of employees in the state administration and affording these workers adequate machinery for regulating and promoting modern and efficient management-labour relations. The Bill, which amends the above-mentioned section , is now before the Senate for discussion and the Government states that it is expecting the text to be adopted this year (). The Bill is based on the ILO's Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the dismissal of an employee in the health service at Concepcin-Arauco - which would constitute an infringement of freedom of association - the Government states that on  November  the director of the hospital requested an administrative inquiry to determine the employee's responsibility in respect of unjustified absence from work, failure to clock in and out, and repeated lateness between October  and September  amounting, on  occasions, to  hours and eight minutes.
.The head nurse appointed to carry out the administrative inquiry found that between October  and January  the person concerned had indeed taken time off without reason on  days, that she had very seldom clocked in and out and that, between these dates, she had been late on  occasions which represented  hours not worked; all this had led her immediate chief to request that she be replaced. On  March , in accordance with the administrative rules, the public prosecutor had proposed sanctions. He had concluded that the person in question had on several occasions failed to comply with her obligations under sections  and  of Act No. .. He had confirmed the charges made against her and decided that deductions should be made from her pay corresponding to the time not worked and that her contract of employment should be terminated.
.According to the Government, the administrative inquiry revealed that the facts were fully proved and that the person concerned had herself admitted that she had frequently been absent. The fact that she disputes the charges made against her does nothing to lessen them. On the contrary, she bears them out when she states that her important duties as a trade union leader should exempt her from the obligation to carry out her work. Such an excuse is without legal foundation. Furthermore, she had previously been reprimanded and fined between  and  for being late or for acting disrespectfully towards her chiefs or towards other employees in the public administration. The Government goes on to say that she nevertheless appealed to the director of the Concepcin-Arauco health service against the decision to dismiss her, in accordance with the administrative rules, but that her appeal was not well received and he confirmed the dismissal. She once again vainly appealed against this decision to a higher authority within the administration, which rejected the appeal and confirmed the decision in an official notification dated  February . She then applied for legal protection to the Court of Appeal but her suit was rejected on  June .
.The Government considers that the right of defence laid down in the rules contains guarantees of impartiality. It maintains that this former public employee has clearly not been persecuted on the grounds of her corporative activities. It was her duty, as a public employee, to work the required hours and",-1,1993,Chile
173,"to abide by the regulations applicable to , public employees.
.The Government specifies that the FENATS has  leaders on its national executive committee and disciplinary committee, who perform their duties normally, respect the hours of work, clock in and out and ask for permission to take time off for corporative reasons. The person concerned, on the other hand, as the inquiry revealed, interrupted her work at any time to go out, without asking her chief's permission or informing anybody at all. In order to facilitate her corporative work, she had even been authorized to sign a book when she left and returned instead of having to clock in and out. She did not sign the book either, however, and in fact refused to do so to ensure that there would be no proof that she was not performing her duties.
.The Government considers, as regards Mrs. Cruz Farias, that there was no persecution on anti-union grounds or infringement of freedom of association but merely enforcement of the laws and regulations in force which apply to all public employees.
.The Government states that it has granted considerable facilities to enable associations of public employees to carry out their corporative work without impeding the normal running of the service, as is proved by Presidential Resolution No.  of  July  which the Government has enclosed. This text refers to a Bill submitted to Congress which aims in particular to settle the question of the establishment of associations of employees in the administration and to grant the leaders of such associations trade union immunity. The text also informs the directors of public services that they are to grant broad facilities to the bodies that have already been set up and to those which are being established, without however impairing the normal running of their services.
.The Committee observes that the present case concerns three questions: () the question of the ban on the right to organize of public employees that is still contained in the laws and regulations in force; () the question of the facilities that should be granted to workers' representatives in the public service; and () the allegation that a workers' representative in the public health sector was persecuted on anti-union grounds.
.As regards the ban on the right to organize of public employees which is still contained in section  of Act No. . of  September  establishing the administrative rules in respect of public employees, adopted by the previous government, the Committee notes that the complainant federation and the Government both state that the present Government has submitted a Bill to Congress designed to guarantee the right to organize of employees in the state administration. The Government specifies that the Bill in question provides for adequate machinery for regulating and promoting management-labour relations and that it is based on the ILO's Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ). The Government adds that the text is now before the Senate and is expected to be adopted in the course of the year ().
.The Committee welcomes this information since the standards contained in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"" and therefore cover public employees. It notes with interest that the Government states that it wishes to reconsider the ban on trade union membership by public employees since this situation discriminates against public sector workers compared with those in the private sector in respect of the right to organize.
.The Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in accordance with the Government's statement, the Bill designed to guarantee the right to organize of public employees will be in line with the principles of freedom of association as regards protection of the right to organize of public employees as well as the facilities that should be granted to them, the procedures for determining conditions of employment and the settlement of disputes, and the civil and political rights they should enjoy. It also requests the Government to ensure that the said Bill will be adopted shortly. The Committee requests the Government to provide it with the text in question and to keep it informed of all developments in the matter.
.As regards the facilities that should be granted to workers' representatives in the public sector, the Committee notes, here too, that the complainant federation and the Government both state that the President of the Republic himself requested the directors of public services to grant workers' leaders facilities in respect of working time. According to the FENATS, such facilities had in any case been granted by the Ministry of Health in Circular No. A- of  to the leaders of corporative organizations, and that the President of the Republic had made frequent references to the content of this circular. The Committee regrets that the Government made no mention of this Ministry of Health circular of  in its reply. It nevertheless observes with interest that the full text of the Presidential Resolution of  July  expressly requests the directors of public services to grant the broadest facilities to organizations that have already been set up or are being established without impeding the normal functioning of the services.
.The Committee welcomes the intention, expressed at the highest level by the President of the Republic, to grant the broadest facilities to organizations that have already been set up or that are being established in the public sector, since, according to Article , paragraph , of Convention No. , such facilities shall be afforded to the representatives of recognized public employees' organizations in order to enable them to carry out their functions promptly and efficiently, both during and outside their hours of work. The Committee draws attention to the fact that according to paragraphs  and  of the said Article , and to Article , the granting of such facilities should not impair the efficient operation of the administration or service concerned, and that the nature and scope of these facilities should be determined by negotiation or such other methods as will allow representatives of public employees to participate.
.The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that, in accordance with the Presidential Resolution of July , those aspects of the Bill designed to guarantee the right to organize of public employees that concern the facilities to be granted to the representatives of public employees' organizations will be based on the provisions of Articles  and  of Convention No. .
.As regards the specific allegation contained in this complaint, namely the anti-union persecution alleged to have been perpetrated against a national and regional leader of the complainant federation representing workers in the public health sector, the Committee observes that the interpretations of the facts given by the complainant federation and the Government are contradictory.
.According to the complainant federation, this leader was dismissed for unjustified absence and repeated lateness whereas she was merely availing herself of the facilities granted by a circular of the Ministry of Health in  to the leaders of public sector corporations. The complainant federation recognizes that the person concerned had on many occasions been absent without authorization but maintains that it was on corporative business. Moreover it encloses the text of two circulars issued by the Under-Secretariat of State for Health in  and  requesting the directors of the health services to grant the broadest facilities to members of the national executive committee of the FENATS in carrying out their work and to consider measures likely to prevent the performing of these activities entailing an economic disadvantage for the leaders in question.
.The Government, however, states that the dismissal took place following an inquiry which gave ample proof that the person concerned had been absent on  days between  and  for no justified reason, that she had failed to clock in or out and that she had been late on  occasions, which represented  hours not worked; this had led her immediate chief to request that she be replaced. Furthermore, still according to the inquiry, between  and  the person concerned had been reprimanded and fined for lateness or disrespectful behaviour towards her chiefs or towards employees in the public administration. According to the Government, she had not been punished for her corporative activities but for having failed to put in the requisite number of hours and for not having respected the regulations governing , public employees.
.The Committee, for its part, insists on the fact that the granting of facilities should not impair the efficient operation of an administration or service but regrets that the circulars issued by the Secretariat of State for Health were not followed up at the Concepcin hospital by a definition of the scope of the facilities to be granted, in particular through negotiation.
.In the circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the case relating to the dismissal of the leader of the FENATS be examined once again in the light of the above-mentioned circulars, and if it is proved that she was dismissed due to her trade union activities, to ensure",0,1993,Chile
174,"that this leader is reinstated in her post. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the ban on the right to organize of public employees contained in Act No. . of  September , the Committee notes with interest that the Bill designed to guarantee the right to organize of employees in the state administration is now before the Senate for consideration. It requests the Government to ensure that the text will shortly be adopted and that it will be in line with the principles of freedom of association regarding the right to organize in the public service. It requests the Government to send it the text in question and to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.(b) As regards the facilities that should be granted to workers' representatives in the public sector, the Committee welcomes the intention expressed at the highest level by the President of the Republic to grant the broadest facilities to organizations that have been set up or are being established in the public sector. It calls on the Government to ensure that the Bill on the right to organize of employees in the state administration will be based on the provisions of Articles  and  of Convention No. .(c) The Committee, while stressing the fact that the granting of facilities should not impair the efficient operation of an administration or a service, regrets that the circulars issued by the Under-Secretariat of State for Health were not followed up at the Concepcin hospital by a definition of the scope of the facilities to be granted. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the case relating to the dismissal of the leader of the FENATS be examined once again in the light of the above-mentioned circulars, and if it is proved that she was dismissed due to her trade union activities, to ensure that this leader is reinstated in her post. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",-1,1993,Chile
175,".The Committee on Freedom of Association has examined this case on a number of occasions, most recently at its February-March  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).)
.Since then, the Government has sent observations on the allegations pending in communications dated  March and  April .
.After the examination of the case by the Committee in February-March , the following allegations remained pending: as regards the presidential pardon granted to Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, the Committee expressed the hope that this pardon would quickly be followed by a re-examination of the proceedings which led to the sentencing of these trade unionists; the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the court proceedings instituted by the dismissed employees of the State Railway Enterprise; the Committee requested the Government to inform it of developments in the legal proceedings brought against Messrs. Olivares, Araya and Aguirre and to send it the text of the judgements when they were handed down; the Committee once again requested the Government to provide information concerning the court proceedings initiated by the trade unionists in the hotel and food sector (CTGACH), Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states that it noted the Committee's recommendation to the effect that it hoped the presidential pardon granted to the trade unionists Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez would be followed by a re-examination of the proceedings which had led to their sentencing. In this respect, the Government points out that the trial against Messrs. Bustos and Martnez followed the rules of due process and ended in a sentence on conviction; this was examined by both the lower court and was finally brought before the Supreme Court of Justice, which upheld the judgement of the court of first instance sentencing the persons involved to internal exile. As requested, the President of the Republic granted a pardon, thus cutting short the sentence that Messrs. Bustos and Martnez were serving and quashing the conviction. The Government is therefore of the opinion, according to the communication, that these proceedings have been duly settled and are closed, resulting in the court setting the case aside, and that the matter is res judicata.
.As regards the developments in the proceedings brought against Messrs. Olivares, Araya and Aguirre for having violated section (), of Act No.  on state security (in accordance with Initiating Orders Nos. -), the Government points out that on  January , the Minister of the Interior withdrew, on behalf of the Government, the application submitted. The examining magistrate of the Court of Appeal in charge of inquiries issued an order on the same date, declaring a general stay of proceedings against the three above-mentioned persons, and requested the records to be filed. This implies that the criminal proceedings have been closed once and for all and that criminal liability has ceased.
.In its communication dated  April , the Government refers to the outcome of the court proceedings initiated by the employees of the State Railway Enterprise dismissed after the strike that occurred in April . In this respect, it points out that immediately after taking office, on  March , it instructed the Director-General of the State Railway Enterprise to try and seek a solution to the trials pending that would comply with the interests of the workers concerned. The Enterprise reached an agreement with the workers that reconciled the interests of the contending parties and solved the problem of the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. This agreement was approved by the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications and now only needs to be submitted to the Fifth Labour Court of Santiago, which is competent in the matter, before the proceedings are finally closed.
.The Government's communication also refers to the court proceedings initiated by the trade unionists of the hotel and food sector (CTGACH), Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn. It states that Angel Cataln, official of the Workers' Union of the COPASIN Company, who was dismissed in , was reinstated and requested leave without pay, thus avoiding having to work for the employer. In June , the COPASIN Company Ltd. dismissed him; on  August , a request for his reinstatement was submitted to the First Labour Court of San Miguel. The proceedings are following their normal course and the last judicial pronouncement made by the court, on  March , was to summon the parties to hear the sentence. As regards the situation of Juan Montalbn, official of the Inter-Enterprise Union in the Restaurant and Hotel Trade of the Metropolitan Region, dismissed in March , the enterprise was ordered by the court to pay his wages outstanding for  and . The Government points out that it does not have any further information to submit on this matter.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's replies on the questions that were pending in this case.
.The Committee notes that the trade union officials Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, who had been sentenced to internal exile, were granted a pardon, which quashed their conviction.
.As regards the developments in the legal proceedings brought against the trade unionists Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya and Sergio Aguirre for having violated the State Security Act, the Committee is pleased to note that the Government withdrew the application on  January , as the examining magistrate of the Court of Appeal declared a general stay in the proceedings, thus bringing the trial to an end.
.The Committee notes with interest the information provided by the new Government to the effect that the State Railway Enterprise reached an agreement with the workers who had been dismissed for having taken part in a strike in April , with a view to their reinstatement, which would put an end to the judicial proceedings these workers had instituted.
.As regards the proceedings to reinstate the trade unionists Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn in the hotel and food sector, the Committee notes that Mr. Cataln was reinstated and then requested leave without pay and was once again dismissed, which gave rise to new court proceedings for reinstatement. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these proceedings.
.As regards the case of the union official Juan Montalbn, the Committee notes that the Enterprise was ordered by the court to pay his wages outstanding for  and .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) the Committee notes that the pardon which was granted to the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez who had been sentenced to internal exile, quashed their conviction;(b) as regards the court proceedings brought against the trade unionists Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya and Sergio Aguirre for having infringed the State Security Act, the Committee is pleased that the Government has discontinued the legal proceedings brought against them, thus ending all criminal liability;(c) as regards the proceedings instituted by the workers of the State Railway Enterprise who had been dismissed for participating in a strike in April , the Committee notes with interest that an agreement was reached between the Enterprise and the dismissed workers with a view to their reinstatement, which would put an end to the judicial proceedings they had instituted;(d) as regards the court proceedings initiated by the trade unionists in the hotel and food sector (CTGACH), Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn, the Committee notes that Mr. Cataln was reinstated, requested leave without pay and was dismissed once again, which gave rise to new court proceedings for reinstatement; in this respect, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the court proceedings in question.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has examined this case on a number of occasions, most recently at its May  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ).)
.Since then, the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) has made new allegations in a communication dated  September . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  October ,  November  and  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.At its May-June  Session the Governing Body approved the following recommendations made by the Committee on these points:- the Committee requested the Government to inform it of any proceedings which may be initiated by the trade union leader Luis Meneses Aranda to recover his nationality, and it requested the complainant to provide specific information on the present situation of this unionist;- as regards union leaders Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, the Committee noted that there had been no change in the legal situation of these trade union leaders and it recalled that the detention and sentencing of trade union leaders for activities related to the protection of their members' interests endangered the free exercise of trade union rights. In the light of the latest information provided by the Government, the Committee urged the Government to take steps to lift the terms of banishment imposed on union leaders Bustos and Martnez;- as regards the legal proceedings initiated by both the College of Teachers of Iquique and by the police as a result of the events which occurred in this town on  May , the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the developments in these proceedings;- as regards the allegations made by the National Confederation of Federations and Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH), the Committee noted the information supplied by the Government and requested the Government to inform it of the developments in the legal proceedings for reinstatement brought by the unionists Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn;- as regards the proceedings instituted by a number of dismissed workers anda number of union leaders of the State Railway Enterprise, the Committee, while noting that  workers as well as trade unionists Jos Ortega and Jos Morales had withdrawn their suit and that trade unionists Andrs Salinas and Pedro Munizaga had been reinstated, requested the Government to inform it of the court proceedings initiated by the other dismissed trade unionists;- as regards the allegations of unfair practices by the Via del Mar Municipal Corporation against the SIFE, the Committee noted the specific information communicated by the Government. It requested the complainants to send more precise information on the points raised in their communication;- as regards the allegations presented by the Workers' Union of the La Previsin Insurance Company, the Committee, while noting the allegations and the Government's reply, requested the latter to inform it of developments in the legal proceedings concerning the contracts signed in ;- as regards the appeal lodged by the Ministry of Internal Affairs against several leaders of the CUT for having called a general strike on  April , the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of developments in the trial of the union leaders Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya and Sergio Aguirre, and to send it the text of the judgement to enable it to reach conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In its communication dated  September , the WCOTP cited two letters containing death threats addressed to Jorge Pavez Urrutia and Osvaldo Verdugo Pea, both leaders of the College of Teachers of Chile.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government indicated that according to information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Mr. Meneses Aranda had not initiated any proceedings towards the reacquisition of Chilean nationality, which can be restored only by law and in accordance with section , final clause of the national Constitution.
.As regards the incidents in Iquique on  May  which resulted in the initiation of court proceedings before the Military Prosecutor of Iquique for ""assault of policeman on duty"", the Government states that in January  a provisional ruling was handed down for the withdrawal of the case and that on  June  the file was closed. Therefore no one was either charged or sentenced as a result of these proceedings.
.As regards the court proceedings instituted by a group of dismissed employees of the State Railway Enterprise, the Government states that two trials are under way before the Fifth Labour Court of Santiago. In one of the trials,  workers concluded an individual agreement with the enterprise. Four cases are still pending.
.As regards the payment of length-of-service severance pay, provided for in employment contracts signed in October , to workers of the La Previsin Insurance Company, the Government states that the company has lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal of Santiago against the decision pronounced by the court of first instance.
.As regards the legal proceedings instituted against the leaders of the CUT, Diego Olivares, Sergio Aguirre and Nicanor Araya, the Government states that the trial is proceeding in the usual manner and that the defendants have access to defence counsel.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that on  October  the President of the Republic granted a presidential pardon, under Act No. , to Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, following the request made by the parties concerned through Mgr. Orozimbo Fuenzalida, a Catholic bishop. The Government considered that the adoption of this measure would be a way of contributing to keeping the peace in an atmosphere of social harmony. The result of the presidential pardon is the remission of the remainder of the sentence of internal exile which Messrs. Bustos and Martnez were serving. They were unconditionally released on  October .
.In its communication dated  November  the Government states, on the subject of the death threats addressed to Osvaldo Verdugo Pea and Jorge Pavez Urrutia, that the defendants' lawyer has lodged a writ with the Court of Appeal of Santiago requesting police protection for a period of  days, as a result of the threats addressed from Buenos Aires in Argentina. On  September , the Court of Appeal accepted this plea and ordered the police to protect these persons, both at their homes and at the headquarters of their organisation, for a period of  days. This decision was implemented by the chief of the metropolitan police of Chile as from  September . The Government states that it does not know the reasons for these death threats contained in letters coming from Argentina.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states, as regards the situation of Mr. Luis Meneses Aranda, that the Civil Identification Office gave him a national identity card, as a Chilean citizen.
.Concerning the court proceedings instituted by dismissed employees of the State Railway Enterprise, the Government indicates that they are still under way before the Labour Court of Santiago.
.As regards the disputes in the insurance company La Previsin SA, the Government indicates that the Court of Appeals of Santiago dismissed the appeal lodged by the employer, thus confirming the lower court's judgement, which granted the workers' compensation payments based on seniority.
.Respecting the legal proceedings instituted against Messrs. Diego Olivares, Sergio Aguirre and Nicanor Araya, the Government indicates that they are now being ""examined in plenary session"" and that, consequently, the tribunal should soon be able to issue a decision.
.As regards the situation of the leader Luis Meneses Aranda, the Committee notes with interest that the person in question finally obtained his Chilean identity papers.
.As regards the internal exile imposed upon trade union leaders Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, the Committee notes with interest that the persons concerned have been granted a presidential pardon and have accordingly been released unconditionally. It expresses the hope that this pardon will be quickly followed by a re-examination of the proceedings which had led to the sentencing of these persons.
.The Committee also notes with interest that the court proceedings initiated against the workers following the incidents which occurred during a demonstration organised in Iquique on  May  ended in a withdrawal of the case and that no one was either charged or sentenced.
.The Committee notes, furthermore, that the court proceedings instituted by dismissed employees of the State Railway Enterprise are still under way. It therefore requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.
.Concerning the disputes on the payment of seniority compensation to workers of the insurance company La Previsin SA, the Committee notes that the Court of Appeals confirmed the lower court's judgements, which upheld the workers' claims.
.The Committee notes that the complainants have not responded to its request to send precise information regarding their allegations in connection with the unfair practices of the Via del Mar Municipal Corporation towards the Inter-Enterprise Trade Union of Educational Officials of the Fifth Region (SIFE). Considering the allegations made in this connection to be too vague to be examined in full knowledge of the facts, the",-1,1984,Chile
177,"Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the legal proceedings brought by the Ministry of Internal Affairs against the leaders of the CUT, the Committee notes that the proceedings concerning Messrs. Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya and Sergio Aguirre are still pending. It therefore requests the Government once again to inform it of developments in these proceedings and to send it the text of the sentences when they are pronounced.
.As regards the death threats addressed to two leaders of the College of Teachers of Chile, the Committee notes that, by virtue of a judicial decision, these persons have been granted police protection for a period of  days.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided information on the court proceedings initiated by the unionists Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn of the CTGACH, with respect to their reinstatement.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee notes with interest that Mr. Meneses Aranda has finally obtained identity papers corresponding to his Chilean nationality and decides that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(b) The Committee notes with interest that Messrs. Bustos and Martnez have been granted a presidential pardon and have thus been released unconditionally and expresses the hope that this pardon will quickly be followed by a re-examination of the proceedings which led to the sentencing of these persons.(c) The Committee notes with interest that no workers were either charged or sentenced as a result of the court proceedings initiated following the incidents that occurred during a demonstration organised at Iquique on  May , it thus decides that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(d) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the court proceedings instituted by the dismissed employees of the State Railway Enterprise.(e) The Committee notes that the Appeals Court confirmed the lower court's judgement, which upheld the payment of seniority premiums to the workers of the insurance company La Previsin SA, and decides that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(f) The Committee, noting that the complainants have not responded to its request for additional information, considers that the aspect of the case concerning the unfair practices of the Via del Mar Municipal Corporation towards the Inter-Enterprise Trade Union of Education Officials of the Fifth Region (SIFE), does not call for further examination.(g) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the developments in the legal proceedings brought against Messrs. Olivares, Araya and Aguirre, and to send it the text of the sentences when they are pronounced.(h) The Committee notes that the two leaders of the College of Teachers of Chile who received death threats have been granted police protection for a period of  days and decides that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(i) The Committee once again requests the Government to provide information concerning the court proceedings initiated by the trade unionists of the CTGACH, Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has examined this case on a number of occasions, most recently at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paragraphs -, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).)
.Since then the ILO has received the following communications from the complainants: the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  October ,  January,  April and  May ; the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  February ; the Workers' Unions of the General Insurance Company and Life Insurance Company:  December ; and the World Federation of Trade Unions:  April . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February,  March,  and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its st Session in November , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations:- as regards the ban on entering the country imposed on various trade unionists, and in the light of Presidential Decree No.  which terminated the administrative bans on entering the country, the Committee requested the Government to inform it whether the unionists Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro had benefited from the terms of this Decree and on developments in the trial concerning the reacquisition of Chilean nationality by the unionist Luis Meneses Aranda;- the Committee noted with concern the sentencing to terms of internal exile and suspended sentence handed down against trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa and stressed that the arrest and sentencing of trade union leaders for activities related to the defence of their members' interests infringe the free exercise of trade union rights; it requested the Government to keep it informed of any change in the legal situation of these union leaders;- as regards the arrest of the journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas, the Committee noted that he had been released on  May , when his detention had reached the maximum period allowed by law, and requested the Government to inform it of the present legal situation of Mr. Crdenas, in particular to indicate whether court proceedings were under way for the suspected acts for which he had been held;- as regards the incidents in Valparaiso and Iquique because of May Day celebrations, the Committee expressed its concern at the way in which International Labour Day festivities in both towns had been disturbed and noted the contradicitions existing between the complainants' allegations and the Government's observations on what had happened in the two towns and requested the Government to inform it of the decision in Florencio Valenzuela's case and on the court proceedings initiated by the College of Teachers of Iquique and by the police, respectively, which were being investigated by the military prosecutor;- as regards the alleged threats and persecution of workers in the Curtiembre Interamericana company who had been involved in collective bargaining, the Committee noted that these workers had not presented complaints to the labour authorities about these alleged actions; however, it requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the bargaining proceedings;- as regards the various allegations presented by the National Confederation of Federations and Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH), the Committee noted the detailed information provided by the Government but requested specific observations on the alleged anti-union practices in this sector such as employer pressure to obstruct unionisation, unfair labour practices when trying to get bargaining rounds under way, mass dismissals of workers when they try to organise; as for the dismissal of trade union leaders Luis Benitez (Inter-Enterprise Union of Workers in the Culinary Arts), Angel Cataln (Workers' Union of the COPASIN company) and Juan Montalbn (Inter-Enterprise Union in the Restaurant and Hotel Trade of the Metropolitan Region), the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of developments in the court proceedings they had brought for their reinstatement;- as regards the dismissal of a number of workers and  trade union leaders in the State Railway Enterprise after a strike, the Committee noted the Government's statement that on  August   of the  dismissed had been reinstated and requested the Government for information on developments in the court proceedings brought by the dismissed workers and on the possible reintegration of the  dismissed trade union leaders.
.The ICFTU encloses with its communication dated  October  a letter from the leaders of the Inter-Enterprise Trade Union of Education Officials of the Fifth Region (SIFE), who allege that the Via del Mar Municipal Corporation engaged in unfair and divisive practices by setting up a parallel organisation, appointing its leaders and pressuring non-teaching personnel to leave the SIFE. Moreover, the check-off of new members' union dues is hindered. The SIFE states that it has filed a complaint against these practices and that it will submit a petition for protection before the courts on behalf of the organisation and non-teaching staff.
.In another communication, dated  January , the ICFTU alleges that the Ministry of the Economy is attempting to disqualify the leaders of the College of Teachers, Osvaldo Verdugo and Jorge Pavez, who are its President and General Secretary respectively, and are members of the National Council of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT). The complainant maintains that the attempt to disqualify them is based on laws adopted without consultation, which run counter to the principles of freedom of association, since teachers are prevented from forming a trade union and are obliged to set up a professional association, the intention being to separate the College of Teachers from the CUT.
.In a communication dated  April , the ICFTU denounces the fact that, on the grounds of the",1,1984,Chile
178,"CUT having called a general strike on  April in order to demand the lifting of the terms of exile of the union leaders Bustos and Martnez, an end to the privatisation of state enterprises and a reply to their list of claims, the Ministry of Internal Affairs had the CUT leaders summonsed for having infringed the Act on Internal Security of the State by calling the strike. The union leaders summonsed are Diego Olivares, Vice-President, Nicanor Araya, Secretary-General, and Moiss Labraa, Sergio Aguirre and Manuel Jimnez, executive council members. The CUT, and the leaders concerned in particular, repeatedly rejected the use of violence before and during the strike.
.In a communication dated  April , the World Federation of Trade Unions also denounces the fact that following the National Day of Protest organised by the CUT on  April , the Government violently suppressed that demonstration and detained the leaders of the CUT: Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya, Sergio Aguirre, Moiss Labraa and Manuel Jimnez. The detained union leaders will be brought to trial.
.In a communication of  May  the ICFTU sends additional information on the five leaders who have been summonsed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs for having called the national strike on  April. They have been able to make statements before the investigating magistrate on two occasions. The Court dropped two of the three counts brought against them by the Ministry and three of the five (Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya and Sergio Aguirre) have been informed that the cases against them have been dropped.
.In a communication dated  December , the Workers' Union of the La Previsin Insurance Company explains that the enterprise's board of directors is composed of workers representing the employers of the Chilean State Bank who hold trade union office and appoint the company's manager. The complainant adds that, as a result of all of the infringements of workers' rights, the trade union decided to hold a public protest directed against the Chilean State Bank. The complainant states that on  September , as Luis Morales Cruz, a worker, was standing in the doorway of that Bank, he was reprimanded by the director of the enterprise representing the state bank employees, who warned him to expect certain consequences; on  September Mr. Morales Cruz was notified of his dismissal. The dismissal was motivated by his having carried out trade union activities.
.The complainant also states that the enterprise disregards the contractual terms in force since  as regards recognition of length of service under which this benefit is paid in full upon termination of the employment relationship. Moreover, the complainant alleges that the leader of the trade union, Gerardo Araya Ramrez, was transferred to a post without specific duties, preventing him from performing his usual work. A claim has been filed against this situation with the Provincial Labour Inspectorate, and the enterprise has continued this practice.
.In a communication dated  February , the WCOTP alleges that the Government, through the Ministry of the Economy, Development and Reconstruction, is attempting to invalidate the election of Osvaldo Verdugo and Jorge Pavez, President and General Secretary respectively, of the College of Teachers, by requesting on the basis of resolution No.  of  January  that these leaders be replaced within  days unless they present evidence that they have clear criminal records. The teachers' leaders had been accused under section  of Act No.  (the State Security Act) of having organised a day of peaceful protest on  and  July  on behalf of the ""Civic Assembly"", an organisation of which the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) was a member. Reference will certainly be made to this accusation in their criminal records.
.In the same communication, the Government reports that the Inter-Enterprise Trade Union of Education Officials of the Fifth Region, which is mainly comprised of auxiliary workers of various municipal and private establishments, applied to enter into collective bargaining with the Via del Mar Municipal Social Development Corporation. This application was not accepted by that Corporation in view of the following considerations: a) The Comptroller-General of the Republic has, in repeated legal opinions, stated that social development corporations such as that of Via del Mar are not enterprises, and therefore the rules governing profit-oriented enterprises of the private sector do not apply to them. b) In addition, it should be borne in mind that section  of the Labour Code provides that there can be no collective bargaining in public institutions or private enterprises, over  per cent of whose budgets in either of the last two calendar years were state-financed, which is the situation of the Via del Mar Municipal Social Development Corporation. c) Moreover, section  of the Labour Code categorically prohibits bargaining between one or more employers and workers employed in more than one enterprise. This is confirmed by the interpretation of this rule given by the Labour Directorate, which ruled that inter-enterprise trade unions do not have capacity to bargain collectively in any way whatsoever.
.Therefore, the Via del Mar Municipal Social Development Corporation is neither economically able nor legally authorised to bargain collectively since this is, moreover, prohibited by law. Enforcement of a law which has been in force for over ten years cannot be considered as an unfair practice. The Inter-Enterprise Union further accuses the Corporation of unfair practice in that it is alleged to have bargained collectively with a ""professional association of auxiliary workers"", which "" ... would appear to have been set up at the Corporation's request"". In this respect, the Government points out the following: (a) there is no record of the existence of this association; (b) neither has it been possible to confirm the existence of any request filed with the court by the alleged parallel trade union organisation. Lastly, the Via del Mar Municipal Social Development Corporation states that it has always had and maintains excellent relations with all of the personnel working under it. In addition, the Corporation co-operates and has co-operated with all workers' organisations with which there is a dialogue and good understanding.
.The Government states further that Rolando Caldern Aranguiz, the former Minister of Agriculture, returned to the country on  September . Hernn del Canto Riquelme, the former Minister of Internal Affairs, returned to the country on  September  and Mario Navarro Castro returned on  September . The Government states that these persons are now residing in the country, to which they returned in accordance with Presidential Decree (E) No.  of  September , which ended their term of exile. As regards trade union leader Luis Meneses Aranda, the Government states that, under the last paragraph of article  of the Constitution of the Republic, persons who have lost Chilean nationality may be rehabilitated by law. The Government is not aware that Mr. Meneses Aranda has initiated any procedure for this purpose.
.As regards the alleged proceedings against the journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas, the Government states that Mr. Crdenas is not a party in any proceedings and that he has not been convicted.
.As regards the events which occurred on  May  in Valparaso and Iquique and the proceedings under way against union leader Florencio Valenzuela, the Government states that the Military Prosecutor of the Intendancy of the First Region of Tarapac is now investigating Case No. / brought against the Chilean police by the Iquique College of Teachers for alleged damage, assault and battery and breaking and entering and that this case was joined to Case No. / which is being investigated by the same Prosecutor and concerns assault of policemen on duty at the time of the events in this city on  May . On  January  the court ordered a temporary stay of proceedings, which ruling is currently being reviewed by the First Court of Appeal of Iquique. As regards the alleged proceedings against the presumed trade union leader Florencio Valenzuela, the Government reports that no proceedings are under way against any person by that name; nor has it been possible to ascertain Mr. Valenzuela's trade union mandate. The Government states that it appears that the information sent to the Committee on  September  was not sufficiently clear and specific since it had been reported that the Third Local Police Court of Valparaso had imposed fines on and issued warnings to the persons concerned and they had been released on the same day that they had been detained in the police station. One of the detainees was Mr. Florencio Valenzuela, who, along with the other detainees, was fined and released the same day; therefore no proceedings against Mr. Florencio Valenzuela are now pending before the local police court.
.As regards the reinstatement proceedings initiated by dismissed employees of the state railway enterprise and  union leaders of that enterprise, the Government states that the partial stoppage of activities which affected the state railway enterprise in April  was clearly illegal since, on the one hand, there was no outstanding labour problem",-1,1984,Chile
179,"and, on the other, the procedure used blatantly infringed the legal order in force. As regards the proceedings brought against the enterprise, they are under way in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Labour Code. The requested evidence of witnesses and documentary proof have been submitted. In one of the trials,  workers withdrew their suit with the agreement of the enterprise. In the trials initiated by Jos Ortega Fuentes and Jos Morales Hernndez, they also withdrew their claim with the approval of the enterprise. It should be added that Andrs Hugo Salinas and Guillermo Munizaga were reinstated by the state railway enterprise.
.The Government sends information on collective bargaining in the Curtiembre Interamericana enterprise, and notes that the bargaining process was completed on  May , with the acceptance by the workers concerned of the employer's final offer. On  May  an administrative fine equivalent to ten monthly contribution units was imposed on this enterprise for infringement of section  of the Labour Code, read together with section  of the same Code. The enterprise lodged an appeal against this fine before the Second Labour Court of Santiago entitled ""Curtiembre Interamericana vs. Labour Directorate"" Case No. , in which a ruling was given on  September  by the regular judge, who cancelled the administrative penalty on the grounds that there had been no infringement of the labour standards referred to. This decision has now been enforced.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government refers to the allegations presented by the ICFTU and the WCOTP concerning the presumed disqualification by the Ministry of the Economy of Osvaldo Verdugo and Jorge Pavez, leaders of the College of Teachers' Professional Association. It states that on  August  that professional association informed the Ministry of the Economy of the election and setting up of a new executive board. On  September , in communication No. , the Ministry of the Economy requested the necessary documents to enter the names of the members of the executive board in the Registry of Executive Boards of Professional Associations kept by that Ministry in accordance with its legal mandate. Under section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  to issue rules governing professional associations, the requirements for eligibility as a director of such an association include not having been convicted or currently being prosecuted on account of a crime or an offence. In order to comply with this legal obligation, the Ministry of the Economy, in communication No.  of  October , requested evidence of a clear criminal record from the  members elected to the executive of the College of Teachers. Of the  members of the executive,  complied with the obligations laid down by the legislation in force. The two other members, Osvaldo Verdugo and Jorge Pavez, however, instead of conforming to the law as the other  members had done, confined themselves to sending the following replies: a) On  November  they stated that their many activities prevented them from applying for a statement as to criminal record. b) A year later, on  November , they stated that they had constantly been out of the city because of their activities, and had therefore been unable to obtain the statement in question. c) In a letter dated  January , they stated that their many activities did not allow them time to apply for the statement as to criminal record.
.Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Economy confined itself to repeating twice in  (communications Nos.  and ) their request for Mr. Verdugo and Mr. Pavez to respect the formalities required by law. In view of the fact that Osvaldo Verdugo and Jorge Pavez refused repeatedly and without reason to comply with an obligation laid down in the law, the Ministry of the Economy decided to penalise their recalcitrance to which end, in Ministerial Resolution No.  of  January , it imposed a cash fine, to be paid into the treasury, on the leaders of the College of Teachers' Professional Association, namely Osvaldo Verduga Pea and Jorge Pavez Urrutia. Therefore, the Ministry of the Economy did not declare these leaders of the College of Teachers ineligible to hold office. Moreover, the Ministry of the Economy is not empowered to disqualify a leader of a professional association by administrative resolution.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government sends its observations on the allegations presented by the Workers' Union of the La Previsin General Insurance and Life Insurance Company and encloses a communication from the managers of both companies dated  February  which, according to the Government, replies to the union leaders' complaint. This communication states that the enterprise has had to face the task of streamlining its operations with consequent staff dismissals, as a result of the difficult financial situation facing it and without which it will hardly be able to continue supplying services in such a competitive and fluctuating market as that in which insurance companies operate. This represents a considerable effort on the part of the enterprise to maintain its employees' source of work, and therefore it has found it difficult to understand the position taken by the workers, who have interpreted this process as being contrary to their interests, without presenting, in the document sent to the Committee, reliable information of sufficient quality and quantity enabling a rational evaluation of the problem to be made. The communication specifies that . per cent of the assets of both companies belong to the Workers' Assistance and Health Fund of the State Bank, . per cent to the Chilean State Bank, and the balance to various shareholders.
.The communication of the managers of the two companies sent by the Government as part of its observations refers to the dismissal of Mr. Morales Cruz, stating that the latter was dismissed at the initiative of the enterprise, which availed itself of the legal power provided for in section  f)of the Labour Code, the employee being paid his statutory severance pay and contractual benefits; the person concerned had not obtained a court rescission of the dismissal, since he had no grounds to contest the decision of the enterprise. As regards the allegation that the enterprise had ignored contractual terms relating to length-of-service severance pay, the subject is being thoroughly discussed in various court proceedings in which the law courts will specify and interpret the scope of the terms of the employment contracts signed in October . The communication likewise refers to the transfer of trade union leader Mr. Araya, which was dictated by a long-standing problem with his immediate chief. As he himself can confirm, it is by no means a problem arising under this management but the enterprise is none the less doing everything possible to remedy the situation and has even offered Mr. Araya a change of job if he deems it advisable.
.In a communication dated  May  the Government refers to the summonsing of the CUT leaders Diego Olivares, Sergio Aguirre, Nicanor Araya, Manuel Jimnez and Moiss Labraa. It states that on  April , these persons incited and called for a total paralysis of production activities, transport, industry, agriculture, commercial activities and public services and utilities including hospitals, schools and universities. They gave instructions that children be kept home from school, that housewives do not go shopping or do chores, that at  p.m. everyone bang kitchen utensils and pots and pans to make deafening and unnecessary noise and that everyone stays home from work and remain inside their house at  p.m. so as to leave the streets and squares deserted. The aims of this calamity to national activities were: a) to force the Supreme Court of Justice to annul the court ruling handed down in accordance with due process and which was res judicata sentencing Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez to banishment for having committed crimes set out in a law dating back to ; b) to force the Government to make all the country's employers pay a minimum wage increase of  per cent above the current level; c) to force all the employers to pay a travel allowance amounting to two daily tickets and a food allowance; d) to demand an increase in the amount of the children's allowance; e) to force the Government to terminate the system of selling shares in companies having monetary capital; f) to force the Government to end the system of readjusting pensions, deposits and savings called the ""promotion unit"" which system had, in fact, permitted the maintenance of the purchasing power of pensions, deposits and savings.
.The Government then states that during the first few days of February  the body called the Single Central Organisation of Workers (CUT) commenced preparations for the total paralysis of the nation's activities on  April. On  March a group of persons belonging to the CUT ""approved by acclamation"" the calling of an illegal work stoppage without any vote or prior discussion according to Nicanor Araya,",2,1984,Chile
180,"General Secretary of the said body. However, this illegal work stoppage was rejected and was not joined by several major union organisations. On  April when the paralysis of activities was called, violent acts took place, such as the destruction of an underground railway wagon; the assault of the driver of a public transport vehicle which resulted in him receiving bullet wounds; the shooting of police officers by two persons planting explosives in the Quinta Normal commune; the theft, ransacking and destruction of medical consultancy rooms in the ""Joao Goulart"" suburb of La Granga; an explosion in the San Bernardo municipality causing serious damage; electricity cuts caused by the toppling of all high tension cable towers; the attack on, robbery and ransacking of merchandise in the ""San Miguel"" shopping centre in La Granga by  persons who also broke windows; the stoning and attempted ransacking of a butchery, a bottleshop and a bakery in San Miguel commune; at the cross-section of Central Avenue and Las Industrias Street, at . p.m. a group of  persons led by five heavily armed individuals whose faces were hidden by hoods broke into the above-mentioned medical clinic owned by the municipality and demolished a wall, intimidated the guards, stole the milk destined for pregnant women and lactating mothers, sacks of rice and other food which the municipality gave to the needy and to those having few resources, medicines which were distributed to patients free of charge and medical equipment and broke down doors and shattered windows and glass. The damage to private property, public buildings and individuals surpassed  million pesos (US$. million) without counting the  million pesos represented by the damage to the  electricity towers and electrical distribution installations.
.The Government states that, given the alarming situation produced by the enormous destruction of private property and the Government's duty to protect law and order and citizens' safety which were seriously affected by these acts, it was decided that the public authority, the Governor of the Interior, would petition the courts to summon Diego Olivares, Sergio Aguirre, Nicanor Araya, Manuel Jimnez and Moiss Labraa in relation to any responsibility they could have in inciting and promoting all types of activities aimed at the collective interruption and suspension of work and stoppages and strikes in public services, production, transport and commerce. This would be a crime under section () of Act No. . on State Security which had been promulgated in  when the Government of Carlos Ibaez del Campo was in power. The petition was lodged on  April  with the secretariat of the Criminal Court of Appeal of Santiago. That court appointed an examining magistrate who questioned and took the statements of the five persons involved and who, on  May , laid charges against Messrs. Olivares, Aguirre and Araya on the grounds that there was reason to believe that they had taken part in the crime set out in section  of Act No. .; at the same time he released them on bail amounting to over , pesos (about US$.). Messrs. Labraa and Jimnez were released unconditionally. The defence counsel for the accused announced that they would appeal the magistrate's decision to bring charges and they had five days in which to lodge the appeal. As regards the sentence of the Appeal Court, the affected parties can make a request for a writ of certiorari to correct any errors or abuses committed by the judges and have the sentence amended. Such a writ is heard by the Supreme Court.
.In its communication of  May , the Government provides information on the present legal status of unionists Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez; during this month of May, Messrs. Bustos' and Martinez' lawyers filed an appeal to the Chamber of Accusations, asking that their banishment be rescinded, that they be transferred to Santiago and that they be allowed to serve the remainder of their sentence on nights. The Chamber of Accusations dismissed that request as lapsed. The defence attorneys further appealed to the Santiago Appeals Court, which unanimously upheld the decision of the Chamber of Accusations. The Government adds that neither Messrs. Bustos and Martnez nor their lawyers appealed to the President of the Republic or to the Minister of Justice, to obtain the presidential clemency for the remainder of their sentence. The Government points out that a privilege can only be granted or denied if the persons concerned request it, and that it cannot grant or deny something that the would-be beneficiaries did not ask.
.As regards the ban on entering the country imposed on Rolando Caldern Aranguiz, Hernado del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro, the Committee notes with interest that in September  these persons returned to the country where they are now residing; as regards trade union leader Luis Meneses Aranda, the Committee observes that the Government states that under article  of the Political Constitution, persons who have lost Chilean nationality may be rehabilitated by a law and that Mr. Meneses Aranda has not initiated any proceedings in this respect. In this connection, the Committee would request the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings for recovery of his nationality which may be initiated by this union leader and requests the complainant to inform it precisely of his present situation.
.As regards the legal situation of union leaders Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, sentenced to banishment, the Committee notes that there has been no change in their legal situation. It recalls that the detention and sentencing of union leaders in connection with activities related to the protection of workers' interests endanger the free exercise of trade union rights. In the light of the last information provided by the Government, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to lift the terms of banishment imposed on leaders Bustos and Martnez.
.As regards the allegations concerning the journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas, the Committee notes the Government's information to the effect that Mr. Crdenas is not a party in any proceedings and he has not been convicted.
.As regards the allegation concerning proceedings against union leader Florencio Valenzuela, the Committee notes that Mr. Valenzuela was fined, together with other detainees, and was released on the same day by the Third Local Police Court of Valparaso and that no proceedings are pending against him; the Committee also notes that the proceedings initiated by the College of Professors of Iquique and by the police, respectively, which are now under way before the military courts, as a result of the events which occurred during the celebration of International Labour Day in , have been referred to the First Court of Appeal of Iquique. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of these court proceedings.
.As regards the collective bargaining process in the Curtiembre Interamericana enterprise, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that this was completed on  October , with acceptance by the workers involved of the employer's final offer.
.As regards the various allegations presented by the National Confederation of Federations and Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH), the Committee takes due note of the detailed information supplied by the Government, in particular as regards the proceedings before the appeal court initiated by Mr. Luis Bentez Galaz, leader of the Inter-Enterprise Union of Workers in the Culinary Arts, against his former employer in order to recover the benefits ordered to be paid to him. The Committee also observes that, according to the information supplied by the Government, the reinstatement proceedings initiated by union leaders Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn are still under way; the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of these proceedings.
.As regards the reinstatement proceedings initiated by a group of workers and union leaders dismissed in connection with a stoppage of work affecting the state railway enterprise, the Committee notes that in one of the trials  workers withdrew their suit with the agreement of the enterprise and that trade unionists Jos Ortega and Jos Morales also withdrew their claim with the approval of the enterprise. It also notes that trade unionists Andrs Salinas and Guillermo Munizaga have been reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the proceedings initiated by the other dismissed trade unionists, namely: Jos Criado, Chairman of the National Federation of Railway Workers; Germn Daz, Secretary of the Federation; Miguel Muoz, its Secretary-General; Ceferino Barra, Chairman of No.  Union; Juan Daz, Secretary of that union; Rafael Rivera, its Treasurer; Ren Vilches, Director of No.  Union of San Bernardo; Oscar Cabello, Director of that union ; Tito Ramrez, Secretary of Trade Union No.  of Santiago; Juan Contreras, Chairman of the No.  Traction Union; Orlando Gahona, Treasurer of that union; and Ivn Orellana and Luis Pradenas, both directors of that union.
.As regards the allegations of unfair practices by the Via del Mar Municipal Corporation against the Inter-Enterprise Union of Education Officials of the Fifth Region,",1,1984,Chile
181,"the Committee notes the specific information supplied by the Government. It requests the complainants to send more precise information on the points raised in their communication.
.As regards the allegations presented by the ICFTU and the WCOTP concerning the attempt by the Ministry of the Economy to disqualify Osvaldo Verdugo and Jorge Pavez, leaders of the College of Teachers, the Committee notes that the information supplied by the Government to the effect that in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  (which provides that in order to be eligible as a director of a professional association, a person must not have been convicted or be currently prosecuted on account of a crime or an offence) the  members of the executive of the College of Teachers were requested to present statements as to their criminal records, and  of them complied with this requirement, except for Mr. Verdugo and Mr. Pavez. This resulted in them being fined, and not disqualified, as the Ministry of the Economy is not empowered to disqualify by administrative resolution a leader of a professional association. The Committee also observes that, according to the complainant, Mr. Verdugo and Mr. Pavez had been charged under the State Security Act of having organised a demonstration in July . In this respect, the Committee points out that a conviction on account of activities related to the exercise of trade union rights should not constitute grounds for disqualification from trade union office and that a legislation providing for disqualification for this type of offence might be regarded as inconsistent with the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegations presented by the Workers' Union of the La Previsin Insurance Company, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, in particular, that Mr. Morales Cruz was dismissed in accordance with the legal provisions, and was paid all of the benefits to which he was entitled and that he did not contest this decision in court. It also notes that the allegation that the enterprise ignored the terms of contracts signed in  as regards length-of-service severance pay is being examined in court. As regards the transfer of union leader Mr. Araya, the Committee observes that the enterprise offered him the opportunity of changing his job if he deemed this advisable. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments of the proceedings under way concerning the contracts signed in .
.As regards the legal proceedings initiated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs against CUT leaders Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya, Moiss Labraa, Sergio Aguirre and Manuel Jimnez for infringement of the State Security Act by calling a general strike on  April in order to demand the lifting of the terms of banishment of union leaders Bustos and Martnez, an end to the privatisation of state enterprises and a reply to their list of claims, the Committee notes the allegations presented by the ICFTU and WFTU. It also notes the Government's observations on the enormous damage to public and private property and the injuries suffered as a result of the disturbances of  April . It observes that the union leaders Moiss Labraa and Manuel Jimnez have been released unconditionally. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the trial of the union leaders Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya and Sergio Aguirre (who have been released on bail) and to send it the text of the judgement so that it can reach conclusions on this case in full knowledge of the facts.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes that the Government has supplied detailed information on most of the allegations pending in this case.b) The Committee notes with interest that in September  Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro returned to the country, where they have been residing ever since; the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any proceedings which may be initiated by the union leader Luis Meneses Aranda for recovery of his nationality, and requests the complainant to provide specific information on the present situation of this trade unionist.c) As regards union leaders Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, the Committee notes that there has been no change in their legal situation and would recall that the detention and sentencing of union leaders in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights. Therefore, in the light of the last information provided by the Government the Committee urges the Government to take steps to lift the terms of banishment imposed on union leaders Bustos and Martnez.d) The Committee notes that the journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas is not a party in any proceedings and that he has not been convicted; it also notes that Mr. Florencio Valenzuela was released on the day he was detained after paying a fine and that no legal proceedings have been initiated against him.e) As regards the legal proceedings initiated both by the College of Teachers of Inquique and by the police as a result of the events which occurred in this town on  May , the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of these proceedings.f) As regards the collective bargaining process in the Curtiembre Interamericana enterprise, the Committee notes that this was completed on  October  with the workers' acceptance of the employer's final offer.g) As regards the allegations presented by the CTGACH, the Committee, while noting the information supplied by the Government, requests it to keep it informed of the development of the legal proceedings for reinstatement initiated by trade unionists Angel Cataln and Juan Montalbn.h) As regards the proceedings initiated by a number of dismissed workers and a number of union leaders of the state railway enterprise, the Committee, while noting that  workers have withdrawn their suit, along with unionists Jos Ortega and Jos Morales, and that trade unionists Andrs Salinas and Pedro Munizaga have been reinstated, requests the Government to inform it of the proceedings initiated by the other dismissed trade unionists.i) As regards the allegations of unfair practices by the Via del Mar Municipal Corporation against the Inter-Enterprise Union of Education Officials of the Fifth Region, the Committee notes the specific information supplied by the Government. It requests the complainants to send more precise information on the points raised in their communication.j) As regards the allegations concerning the ineligibility for union office of Osvaldo Verdugo and of Jorge Pavez, leaders of the College of Teachers, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the Ministry of the Economy is not empowered to disqualify the leader of an association by administrative resolution and that evidence of a clear criminal record is required in accordance with the law and that it has already been presented by  of the  members of the executive board of the College of Teachers. In this respect the Committee points out that a conviction on account of activities related to the exercise of trade union rights should not constitute grounds for disqualification from trade union office and that a legislation providing for disqualification for this type of offence might be regarded as inconsistent with the principles of freedom of association.k) As regards the allegations presented by the Workers' Union of the La Previsin Insurance Company, the Committee, while noting the allegations and the Government's reply, requests the Government to inform it of developments in the legal proceedings concerning the contracts signed in .l) Lastly, as regards the legal proceedings initiated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs against various leaders of the CUT for having called a general strike on  April , the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the trial of the union leaders Diego Olivares, Nicanor Araya and Sergio Aguirre and to send it the text of the judgement so that it can reach conclusions on this case in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has examined this case on a number of occasions, most recently at its May  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).)
.Since then the ILO has received the following communications from the complainants: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  May,  June,  July and  August ; College of Chilean Teachers:  May ; National Grouping of Workers (CNT):  and  June and  August ; Union of Workers in the ""Dos en Uno"" foodstore:  and  June ; National Confederation of Federations and Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH):  July ; World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  August ; National Federation of Petroleum and Related Workers of Chile:  September ; and",1,1984,Chile
182,"World Confederation of Labour (WCL):  September . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  June,  July,  August,  September and  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its th Session in May-June , the Governing Body approved the Committee's recommendations on: the ban on returning to the country imposed on a number of trade unionists, and specifically Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro, in respect of whom the Committee urged the Government to lift the ban and to keep the Committee informed of developments; the restoring of Chilean nationality to trade unionist Luis Meneses Aranda; the legal position of union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, in respect of whom the Committee noted with interest the verdict of not guilty handed down by the Santiago Court of Appeal and expressed the hope that they would continue to exercise their trade union rights normally in the future. Lastly, the Committee invited the Government to supply its observations on the allegations on which no reply had yet been received, namely: the communication from the COPESA (Consorcio Periodstico de Chile, SA) Workers' Trade Union No.  concerning the dismissal of workers from this union who resisted pressure by the undertaking to persuade them to forgo a cost-of-living pay increase which had been agreed to in a collective agreement made with the undertaking; the complaint submitted by the CTGACH concerning pressure to which workers in this sector are subjected to prevent them from organising, mass dismissals following the signing of collective agreements, the dissolution of unions in this sector, pressure by the undertaking to force workers to sign individual contracts instead of enjoying the benefits stemming from collective agreements, the use of contract labour as a means of avoiding unionisation, and the dismissal of trade union leaders and the situation in unions having members in a number of different undertakings; the complaint submitted by the ICFTU and CNT concerning the dismissal of  trade union leaders (including Miguel Muoz and Jos Criado of the CNT) and over  workers from the State Railway Undertaking for having presented the Government with petitions concerning social and economic claims and for having called a strike when the latter failed to respond; the allegations made by CONTEXTIL concerning difficulties faced by workers in the Curtiembre Interamericana Works Union in reaching a collective agreement with the undertaking and on the unfair labour practices of the said undertaking against the workers involved in the committee working on the draft collective agreement.
.In a communication dated  May , the ICFTU expresses its concern at the announcement of the abduction of the journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas, director of the review Anlisis, in Santiago on Wednesday,  May when he was entering the prison to serve a -day night detention sentence. The letter states that he was violently abducted by heavily armed unidentified civilians and that nothing is known of the present whereabouts of Mr. Crdenas, who is a member of the Journalists' Association of Chile, of the Latin American Federation of Journalists and of the Chilean Writers' Society. Mr. Crdenas has been imprisoned on three occasions, charged with insulting and slandering the military government, his review has been suspended and the premises searched by the military authorities several times. The ICFTU's letter adds that in September  the international editor of the review, Mr. Jos Carrasco Tapia, was kidnapped and killed by an armed group which has still not been brought to justice.
.In a letter dated  June , the ICFTU states that trade unionist Freddy Nuez, assistant General Secretary of the Workers' Central Democratic Organisation (CDT) and director of the ""Fuente Alto"" paperworks, went to the police of his own free will to report finding a secret chamber in his house in the Quinta Normal district of Santiago which he had been renting out for a long time; the police immediately detained him and kept him in solitary confinement for five days and then released him unconditionally. He was subsequently rearrested and kept in solitary confinement in the Santiago prison, where he had been for  days (at the time the letter was written). The military prosecutor was to decide by  June whether Mr. Nuez would be released or remain in prison. The ICFTU's letter expressed concern for the life of this trade unionist since he was in poor health as a result of the long period spent in solitary confinement and the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected.
.In a further communication, dated  July , the ICFTU denounces the violent repression by the police of the march organised by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) to obtain a response from the authorities to their demands. The march was broken up violently and an unspecified number of workers taking part in it were injured and arrested; Mr. Jorge Milln, vice-chairman of the CNT and chairman of the CEPCH (Confederation of Private Employees of Chile) is still under arrest.
.In its letter of  August , the ICFTU denounces the sentencing, on  August, of Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez to  days' internal exile. Union leader Bustos was to serve his sentence at Parral,  kilometres south of Santiago, and union leader Martnez was to serve his in Chanaral,  kilometres north of Santiago. This sentence of internal exile was imposed because these trade unionists had called the strike of  October  in support of socio-economic claims. The Court of Appeal had previously closed the case but the military government insisted on bringing it before the Supreme Court, which finally gave this verdict. The vice-chairman of the CNT, Moiss Labraa, was also sentenced to  days' imprisonment but was released on parole. These sentences were delivered  hours before the holding of the constituent assembly of the new Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT), whose main organisers were union leaders Bustos and Martnez.
.In a letter dated  August , the WFTU also denounces the sentences passed on the unionists Bustos, Martnez and Labraa.
.In a letter dated  June  the CNT explains that with a view to celebrating International Labour Day on  May, trade union organisations throughout the country requested permission from the competent government authorities to hold public demonstrations. In most cases these requests were turned down merely on the grounds of keeping public order. In the few cases where permission was granted, the demonstrations were to be held elsewhere than in the places requested, outside the city centres which would be difficult for the workers to get to. In all cases - whether or not permission had been granted to hold demonstrations - the authorities organised an impressive turnout of police forces to intimidate the population or repress the workers' legitimate right to demonstrate. This is how the May Day events that were held in various towns ended up with dozens of persons injured and hundreds under arrest.
.The CNT refers in its letter to events in the town of Iquique, the place selected by the Government for the official May Day ceremony. The official celebrations were presided over by General Augusto Pinochet and were given wide publicity. Vast numbers of people and army forces were transported there from other parts of the country. The Regional Grouping of Workers of Iquique, with due notice, requested permission to organise a public event for workers in the town. The permission was refused in accordance with the terms of a regional military decree banning all public demonstrations, with the exception, of course, of the official one organised by the Government. The workers of Iquique, like those in other towns where demonstrations were not allowed, gathered in the local cathedral to take part in the religious ceremony commemorating San Jos Obrero (the workers' patron saint) at which Monsignor Javier Prado A, the bishop of the diocese, officiated. Following the service, the workers met outside the church to listen to Arturo Martnez, general secretary of the National Grouping of Workers. Since the official ban meant that no public demonstrations could be held, the workers moved in an orderly manner towards the Regional College of Teachers which, in a gesture of solidarity, had made its union office available for a meeting. On their way to the college, the lines of workers were intercepted and set upon violently by special forces of armed police, who injured and arrested dozens of people. Among these was Julio Prieto Zrate, a worker who was hit by a tear-gas bomb fired from a shotgun, and the director of the radio Iquique FM, Fernando Muoz Marinkovic, whose arm was broken after he was attacked and beaten with truncheons. As a result of the police repression, only some  people managed to reach the union premises to hold the indoor meeting.
.The letter adds that as the meeting was beginning, with greetings from",0,1984,Chile
183,"Jorge Pavz, general secretary of the National College of Teachers, the police burst into the building, breaking doors and windows and letting off tear-gas bombs. They then withdrew, blocking the exits and forming a cordon around the building. This caused panic among the workers and their families who were inside and a disorderly and hysterical attempt to escape ensued. As the building was vacated, the police, who were not content with the material damage they had caused or with their physical and mental aggression, set about beating up and arresting people as they came out.
.The letter goes on to say that the workers in the city of Valparaso were also prevented from celebrating May Day. The Regional Grouping of Workers requested permission from the government authorities a month in advance to organise an event in the low-lying part of the town which, as is well known, is half surrounded by hills inhabited by workers and port people and which is not easily accessible to those who do not live there because of the physical effort entailed or the cost if public transport is used. The town's social organisations, represented by the ""Civic Assembly"", supported the petition of the trade union organisations, emphasising that a venue should be determined for the event and that it should not be outside the low-lying part of Valparaso. The communication states that the workers did not expect any difficulty in securing permission, especially since a public ceremony was to be organised by the regime in the centre of Valparaso a few days before May Day on the occasion of a visit by General Augusto Pinochet. However, although the authorities granted permission for a public event to be organised by the workers, the only place they could hold it was the Alejo Barrios park on the Playa Ancha hill. The authorisation amounted in fact to a veiled refusal since it would have involved transport costs for the workers to get to the park. The workers consequently decided to organise the event in the Plaza del Pueblo, in the centre of the city. The demonstration was brutally repressed by armed police who were deployed by the Government on an exceptionally large scale: military vehicles were used to attack the crowd with tear-gas and water hoses. The workers' silent and peaceful march to the meeting point, as well as the demonstration itself, were repressed mainly by a hail of rubber bullets (which can be highly dangerous) which injured a large number of workers. Among the persons injured in this way were Mr. Sergio Aguirre Martnez, a member of the executive of the National Grouping of Workers and chairman of the Seamens' Confederation, and Mr. Jos Gaete, leader of the National Union of Pensioners (UNAP) of Valparaso. According to the official government report, some  persons were arrested, including Alejandro Valenzuela, chairman of the Commercial Workers' Union of Valparaso and a member of the executive of the regional CEPCH, together with trade unionists Luis Borg and Fanor Castillo. Police brutality reached its height when, in front of witnesses, officers began to torture a youth called Gonzlez whom they had arrested, beating him about the testicles and stomach, causing almost instantaneous haemorrhage from the mouth. Trade union leaders tried in vain to persuade the police to restrain their violence but the latter replied that they were acting on orders from superiors.
.In a letter dated  June  the CNT, after outlining the situation of the trade union movement in Chile, requests the ILO to appoint a direct contacts mission to examine the complaints presented against the Government of Chile.
.In a further communication, dated  August , the CNT denounces the arbitrary dismissal of the former president of the Petroleum Workers' Federation and former adviser to the CNT, Mr. Jos Ruiz de Giorgio. The CNT states that Mr. de Giorgio's dismissal is a repressive measure motivated by his outstanding trade union work and for his having taken over the management of a regional body in favour of the ""NO"" vote in the forthcoming plebiscite.
.The Union of Workers of the ""Dos en Uno"" foodstore states that as from the last round of collective bargaining, in June , the employers began to require workers to sign instruments described as ""collective agreements"" but which are drawn up by the company as it deems fit without the workers being able to discuss the content. This, the complainant states, is obviously a one-sided ""agreement"". The company writes to each worker, informing him of its intention to establish conditions of work different from those so far governed by the collective agreement and giving them a time-limit within which to go, individually, to the personnel office to sign a new contract. The company offers some fringe benefits (such as food baskets) as an incentive. So far nine such agreements have been signed, all with different dates of entry into force, affecting practically all the workers belonging to the union.
.The letter from the Union of Workers of the ""Dos en Uno"" foodstore adds that, on  May , the union submitted a draft collective agreement but that the company responded by objecting to the participation in the bargaining of  out of the  members of the union. That is to say it recognised only the five union leaders as agents in the bargaining process. This meant that the statutory quorum could not be reached and, consequently, that this right could not be exercised. The complainant quotes section  of the Labour Code which provides that employers and workers may, by mutual agreement, begin direct discussions with a view to signing a collective agreement, as is provided in section () of the same Code which stipulates that a worker covered by a collective agreement that is still in force may not take part in other collective bargaining before the expiry of the current agreement. The communication adds that the employer (the ""Dos en Uno"" foodstore) is itself drawing up documents which it describes as collective labour agreements in order to prevent collective bargaining taking place in its establishment. The complainant concludes by stating that the facts are aggravated when the Labour Directorate and its departments go along with this type of manoeuvre, since the Labour Inspectorate of Santiago, in decision No.  of  June , rejected the objection concerning legality submitted by the union, confining itself to ascertaining the existence of documents which have the appearance of collective agreements.
.In a subsequent communication, dated  June , the Union of Workers of the ""Dos en Uno"" foodstore supplies further information in which it states that, since the number of agreements in the company is growing rapidly, they involve fewer workers each time: agreements that originally covered  workers, now cover only . Furthermore, the letter goes on to say that since the number of staff will shortly be increased to , workers, none of the groups covered by the ""agreements"" will be able to bargain collectively since they will not muster the minimum number required by section  of the Labour Code ( per cent of the total number of workers in the enterprise). Thus not only is the right to bargain collectively being undermined but the exercise of this right is actually being completely obstructed. As an illustration of the labour policy followed by the company, the union explains in its letter that immediately after the lawful -day strike in , the company dismissed over  unionised workers and replaced them by new staff.
.The letter concludes by requesting the intervention of administrative services coming under the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to investigate the type of practice that has given rise to the complaint, and the amendment of section  of the Labour Code by the addition of certain minimum requirements to safeguard collective bargaining.
.In a letter dated  May , the College of Teachers of Chile denounces the fact that on May Day , the workers of the town of Iquique were prohibited by a military decree issued by the Commander of the region, from holding any public celebration of International Labour Day. On this occasion the ban was especially significant for the workers of Iquique since the Government had selected their town as the centre for its own celebrations of what it termed ""National Labour Day"". The celebrations marking this event, which was attended by General Augusto Pinochet, were organised on a scale unprecedented in the area: vast numbers of people were transported from all over the country, an official publicity campaign was launched involving the mass media and public sites, and special police forces were brought in from Santiago and other major cities. The vast numbers of police and the enthusiasm of the Government contrasted with the ban on trade union celebrations which prevented the unions from expressing and disseminating the views and claims of the workers. The regional organisation of the National Grouping of Workers had, with the requisite notice, applied to the relevant authorities for permission to hold a public workers' demonstration",1,1984,Chile
184,"to commemorate May Day but permission had been refused. Seeing this, the Regional Directorate of the College of Teachers of Iquique, as a gesture of solidarity, made their union premises available to the workers of Iquique and to the Regional Council of the National Grouping of Workers so that this important date could be commemorated, even if only privately.
.The letter states that following a religious ceremony conducted by the Bishop of Iquique in the local cathedral, workers from the congregation walked peacefully to the premises of the Regional College of Teachers. The walk was characterised by its peaceful nature, despite the intimidating effect of the overwhelming presence of police throughout the town. They walked in an orderly manner and almost in silence along the pavements, so that the traffic was not disturbed. During the walk the workers had to endure provocation and aggression by the police, resulting in dozens of arrests and injuries. In particular, the repression involved physical blows and the use of tear-gas bombs fired from shotguns. One of the persons thus injured was the managing director of the local radio station (Radio Iquique FM), Mr. Fernando Muoz Marinkovic. About  men, women and children gathered in the union premises of the Regional College, including teachers and leaders of the Regional Grouping of Workers. The intention was to hold a private ceremony, without microphones and even with the doors and windows closed. At the point when Mr. Jorge Pavz, general secretary of the College of Teachers of Chile, was speaking, the police forced their way into the building, firing tear-gas bombs directly on the people gathered there and then shutting the doors again. As a result, the workers and their families who were present panicked; fortunately, none lost their lives but dozens were injured. Those who were able to begin leaving the building were struck or arrested by the police and many of the workers were injured physically and psychologically. The damage to the union premises as a result of this police attack was considerable. On the day following these events the Regional Directorate of the College of Teachers, following legal advice from the Iquique Human Rights Committee, brought a criminal charge before the competent criminal court judge, on the following grounds: assault and violation of private property, injuries to third parties and destruction of other people's property. At the same time it lodged a civil claim for damages. Photographs are enclosed with the letter from the College of Teachers of Chile showing the state of the premises following the police action.
.In a letter dated  July , sent both to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and to the ILO, the National Confederation of Federations and Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH) denounces the discrimination prevailing in the sector, where workers are allowed to work up to  hours and more per day although the law lays down a maximum of  hours. The letter also states that an investigation of the situation has been requested in view of the pressure exerted by employers in the sector to prevent unionisation but that no reply has been received from the relevant bodies. Moreover, in the complainant's union, particularly in the big hotels, the permanent staff have been replaced by staff from outside the establishment provided by subcontractors, which is detrimental to the trade union organisations as is the manoeuvre of hiring workers on short-term contracts and, at the end of the contracts, drawing up new short-term contracts - a process that can be repeated indefinitely. In addition, the letter states, overt pressure is exerted by the employers when confronted with the process of collective bargaining, which makes the process inoperative. When employers in the sector cannot make use of the permanent staff, the latter are dismissed, sometimes without being paid the amounts due to them, which leads the complainant to affirm that in over  per cent of cases in the relevant sector the labour laws are not complied with, labour relations having given way to the ""might is right"" principle, the workers in this case being the weaker of course.
.The letter from the CTGACH contains a detailed list of enterprises in which the alleged infringements occur: the ""Dos en Uno"" Foodstore Limited, Conservas Los Reyes, Chocolates Costa, Rocofrut de Curico, the Vegetariano and Prosit restaurants, as well as other establishments in the city. The Confederation concludes by stating that three of its leaders have now been dismissed arbitrarily and that legal proceedings are under way in which the workers' cause has been upheld. It adds that complaints are being made daily to the labour inspection services concerning infringements of this type, with little result, and that the workers in small establishments in the capital and throughout the country have to face layoffs for months on end as a result of which they are forced to drop proceedings against their employers and to emigrate in search of work.
.In a letter dated  September , the Federation of Unions of Petroleum and Allied Workers of Chile denounces the infringement of the freedom of association of former trade union leader, Jos Ruiz de Giorgio, who was chairman of the federation until the end of , during which time he was persecuted on the grounds of his trade union activities. Of his own free will Ruiz de Giorgio gave up his trade union work at the end of  to return to his usual work as captain in the navigating enterprise ENAP-Magallanes. The letter adds that a few weeks ago, when he was speaking in public about a book on labour matters that had come out, he was consulted by the journalist interviewing him on the dismissal of  workers in the Magallanes area, about  of whom were entitled to a retirement pension. Mr. Ruiz de Giorgio stated that he did not understand the situation since the enterprise ENAP-Magallanes which said that it was overstaffed was, at the same time, taking on a large number of relatives of the firm's senior executives. He also denounced the fact that for the first time an international contract had been awarded without tenders having been invited, thereby contravening national regulations, and that he was going to request the competent authorities to make an official investigation of the matter. As a result of these statements, he received a written warning following which, on  August , he was dismissed without further explanation. The management of the enterprise later explained that he had been dismissed because of the statements he had made; the enterprise was thus passing judgement on him, taking on powers that belong only to the courts.
.In a letter of  September  the WCL denounces the fact that since  an anti-social and anti-union policy has been followed in Chile, entailing severe repression of lawful activities by the workers in defence of their interests, such activities being interpreted by the authorities as movements aimed at destabilising the Government. Trade union leaders such as Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa are accused of being agitators and of fomenting illegal strikes and subversive acts, on which grounds they are sentenced. On  March  the Second Chamber of the Santiago Court of Appeal, before which these persons had lodged an appeal, overturned the verdict of the court of the first instance. Bustos and Martnez have once again been given a -day sentence and Labraa's sentence is for over  days' imprisonment. It is clear, the letter states, that the Government wishes at all costs to stifle any trade union activity aiming to establish social justice and freedom of association in Chile and to isolate workers and the leaders of trade unions which are struggling for the welfare of the working masses. The letter concludes by declaring that the sentences are unjust and should be rescinded. The Government should allow trade unionists to go about their trade union activities freely.
.In a letter dated  July , concerning the request by the CNT and the ICFTU for a direct contacts mission to be sent to Chile, the Government states that a study of this request reveals that there are no specific factors which constitute a serious situation as regards trade unionism in Chile. After making general references to alleged infringements of freedom of association, the complainants embark on political considerations which prejudge the legality of the current electoral plebiscite in stating that: ""It is feared that the Government, availing itself of its wide discretionary powers, is stepping up and multiplying its activities to repress and restrict human, civil, political and trade union rights"". All this, the Government states, does not stand up to objective judgement and shows the ambiguity of the statements that are supposed to support the request for a direct contacts mission. The Government expresses its surprise at this request since the procedure in question is a special one applicable to countries which have repeatedly refused to co-operate with the ILO to resolve cases or to",1,1984,Chile
185,"provide information requested of them to shed light on such cases; this in no way corresponds to the attitude of Chile, whose constant co-operation has been appreciated and recognised by the Committee. The Government of Chile wishes to continue its unfailing co-operation. Consequently, the letter states, the request from the National Grouping of Workers has no legal foundation and lacks objectivity. Moreover, the direct contacts procedure, in which an ILO representative is sent to the country in question, must follow the procedure established by the Office itself for the examination of complaints ""with a view to seeking a solution to the difficulties encountered, either during the examination of the case or at the stage of the action to be taken on the recommendations of the Governing Body"" and in the situation under consideration such difficulties have not been encountered either during the examination of the case or as regards the action to be taken on the recommendations of the Governing Body.
.The Government states further that the procedure also provides that a direct contacts mission ""can only be established at the invitation of the governments concerned or at least with their consent"" and that the Government of Chile, aware of the ILO's budgetary difficulties, had, on the occasion of the visit of a senior ILO official who is an expert in international labour standards to a neighbouring country, suggested that he visit Chile in order to acquaint himself on the spot with the national trade union situation, offering every guarantee for the widest range of contacts, not only with the authorities, but also with representatives of trade unions. Regrettably, this suggestion could not be carried out and there is no reason, months later, to carry out the request of the CNT, since it is clearly motivated by political considerations aiming to involve the ILO and use its image in an essentially internal political process in which Chile will define its democratic institutional nature providing guarantees for all of its citizens.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government refers to the situation of trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, stating that on  August the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice unanimously upheld the appeal lodged by the Ministry of the Interior against these three persons for serious disturbance of the public order provoked by their call for a nation-wide stoppage of work on  October ; the stoppage of activities (including essential services) and its inevitable result of violence and terrorist acts provoked by the union leaders, is defined in the State Security Act which has been in force since  and has been applied by every Government of the country since that year. The decision of the Supreme Court cannot therefore be considered a violation of the legitimate right to strike enshrined in international labour legislation and fully incorporated in Chilean legislation. This was not a case of activities related to freedom of association, but of acts aimed at disturbing the public order and damaging public and private property.
.The communication states further that it should be noted that this court decision was the outcome of a trial that had lasted nearly  months and had been considerably prolonged by the appeals lodged and the delaying tactics employed by the defence council of the accused. It was therefore not based on political considerations, although an attempt was made to find a political motivation citing the fact that these persons had been appointed to the executive of the recently reconstituted Single Central Organisation of Workers. Such a political consideration is not at all in keeping with the independence, traditional conduct and spirit of the national judicial power. The judges of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court merely applied the legislation in force and imposed the penalties laid down for an infringement of legal standards. It should be recalled that the above-mentioned union leaders had been sentenced in the first instance to various terms of imprisonment; that subsequently, the court of the second instance (the Court of Appeal) had given a ruling of diminished responsibility and that, following the appeals procedure, the Supreme Court had decided to uphold the decision of the court of the first instance, but with the sentences substantially reduced: the term of deprivation of freedom (imprisonment) having been replaced by restriction of freedom, that is, internal exile.
.The communication concludes that it should be pointed out once again that this was essentially a case of objective application of the legal standards in force since . The Government had not resorted to administrative procedures, as it is entitled to do during a state of emergency, but, on the contrary, had acted in accordance with its normal standards of conduct, and had turned to the courts (whose decision in the second instance had even been favourable to the union leaders) in order to obtain a verdict on acts contrary to the legal order and the national interest of maintaining internal order and rejecting violence. The rule of law had thus been guaranteed and the accused had been given every opportunity of a fair trial and adequate defence. It must be emphasised that there had been no violation of the right to strike in this case, since this right, which is guaranteed by national legislation, bears no relation to the acts which the courts of law had condemned. Legal strikes follow procedures which are clearly laid down in the law and which had not been complied with in this case by those who had called for a stoppage of activities and the wave of infringements consequently unleashed. No civilised society could condone, on the pretext of a distorted application of the principles of freedom of association, explicit calls for criminal acts endangering the life and property of the public, provoking anarchy and bringing essential public services to a standstill.
.In a detailed communication dated  September , the Government sends additional information on the legal situation of trade unionists Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, indicating that Mr. Bustos was indeed sentenced to  days' internal exile to the town of Parral, Mr. Martnez to the same term in the town of Chaaral and Mr. Labraa to a -day suspended sentence of imprisonment. Section  of the Penal Code provides that ""internal exile is transfer of the accused to an inhabited location within the territory of the Republic, being prohibited to leave it but remaining free"". This means that the sentence is not one of deprivation of freedom, such as a term of imprisonment, but only one of restriction of freedom of movement to the town of exile. The exiled person may live with his family, work, hold meetings and do anything except leave the town where the sentence is being served. This sentence is served in freedom, as the person is not imprisoned. A suspended sentence, under section  of Act No. , (Diario Oficial of  May ), means that the sentence is not carried out in special establishments under police custody. The sentence is not one of deprivation of freedom; a person thus sentenced remains under constant police surveillance by periodically signing a register. Despite the verdict of guilty, the defence counsel of the accused lodged two appeals against the sentence of the Supreme Court. One of the appeals was for clarification and the other for reversal, aimed at obtaining a reconsideration of the decision of  August . However, the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court, by unanimous vote of its five members, rejected the two appeals in a ruling of  August , and thus upheld the verdict of guilty handed down on  August . The Government encloses a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court and adds that it has no further information to give on this aspect of the case.
.In its communication of  September  the Government, as regards the ICFTU communication concerning the arrest and alleged ill-treatment of Mr. Freddy Nuez, states that on Friday,  June , Mr. Hctor Collado, who lives in a rented house at the address San Vicente Street No. , informed the police that, as a result of a landslide causing the tiles covering the terrace to cave in, a secret underground hiding place under the terrace had been exposed. The house which he rents is the property of Mr. Freddy Nuez. Upon visiting the house, the police discovered  containers of mass-produced explosive anti-personnel grenades in the above-mentioned underground hiding place. The tenant, Mr. Hctor Collado, and the owner, Mr. Freddy Nuez, were arrested that same day, Friday  June, by order of the second military prosecutor, in order to carry out an investigation and make a decision as to their responsibility. Under Act No. ,, approved in , respecting weapon and explosives control, it is the special courts which are competent to examine offences and infringements of the said Act. On Thursday,  June , after conducting interrogations, the prosecutor decided to release Mr. Hctor Collado and",-1,1984,Chile
186,"Mr. Freddy Nuez on bail for  days; that is, they were prohibited from leaving the country for that period. However, the communication goes on, this did not turn out to be the case for Mr. Freddy Nuez, as the prosecutor decided to place him at the disposal of the ad hoc prosecutor investigating an attempt to assassinate the President of the Republic, the kidnapping of a lieutenant-colonel in the army and the smuggling of weapons into the country for subversive purposes, hiding them in underground hiding places located in homes in various districts of Santiago similar to that discovered in the house belonging to Mr. Nuez. The ad hoc prosecutor then interrogated Mr. Nuez in order to elucidate a presumption that the above-mentioned hiding place had been used to hide army Lieutenant-Colonel Carlos Carreo, kidnapped the year before by a terrorist commando, smuggled out of the country and subsequently freed in Brazil. On  June , the ad hoc prosecutor, on the basis of the interrogations of Mr. Freddy Nuez, ordered the arrest of a couple who had rented Nuez's house before the present tenant and who were suspected of having taken part in building the secret hiding place where the explosive devices had been found, and on  June  the ad hoc prosecutor ordered Mr. Freddy Nuez's unconditional release, after having interrogated him and ascertained that he had not been involved in building the secret hiding place or in placing the explosive devices found in the house belonging to him.
.The communication contains some observations on this aspect of the case: the motive for the arrest of Mr. Freddy Nuez and Hector Collado was the discovery of the secret underground hiding place containing explosive devices, in the context of an investigation under way to discover the destination of a large amount of weapons smuggled into the country by a terrorist group. Therefore, it bears no relation to freedom of association or labour rights, since the case comes under criminal jurisdiction, and has nothing to do with rights in the labour field. After investigations had been carried out, Mr. Nuez was released unconditionally on  June ; however, the complaint of the ICFTU was made on  June and received by the ILO on  June. This discrepancy in the dates shows that Mr. Nuez had already been freed when the ICFTU complained of the physical ill-treatment and danger to his life to which he had been subjected. In press statements, Mr. Nuez himself said that he was not physically ill-treated and his life was never in danger during his detention. At all events, both Mr. Nuez and Mr. Collado may take any legal action they deem appropriate to defend their rights if they consider that they have been infringed. Lastly, the communication states that Mr. Freddy Nuez continues to carry out his activities normally and in full freedom.
.The Government's communication refers to the aspect of the case mentioned by the ICFTU in its communication dated  July , concerning the arrest of trade unionist Jorge Milln during a march organised by the CNT; in this regard, the Government states that on Thursday  June , a female contingent of a de facto organisation running counter to the law in force, whose representativity is not known, since it does not have legal personality, held a march without previous authorisation in the city centre with the aim of achieving a massive gathering of the public in the neighbourhood of the Plaza los Hroes, obstructing traffic in the streets; however, young students of a higher educational establishment, the Instituto Profesional de Santiago, and other minors, began raising barricades in the street, throwing stones at cars and lighting bonfires, making it necessary to deviate traffic into side streets for over one hour and to close the entrances to the ""Los Hroes"" and ""Moneda"" stations of the city subway. This public disturbance called for the intervention of the uniformed police, who detained the persons involved. One of those detained was Mr. Jorge Milln, who was taken to the police precinct of the third police station, where he was detained for the statutory period until a decision had been taken on the legal action to be brought against him. On  July , Mr. Jorge Milln was released by the police, having completed the statutory period of detention, since the authorities had decided not to instigate legal proceedings against him. All of the other persons detained on  June in connection with the same events were released. In press statements, Mr. Milln said that he had been treated well during his detention and that he was returning to his work in a laboratory. The Government would like to draw attention to the fact that the complaint of the ICFTU was presented to the ILO on  July , after Mr. Milln and all the other persons detained had been released.
.Another aspect of the case referred to in the Government's communication concerns the situation of Mr. Juan Pablo Crdenas, mentioned by the ICFTU in its communication dated  May . The Government states that on  May  at approximately  p.m., as Mr. Juan Pablo Crdenas was about to enter the ""Centro Abierto Manuel Rodrguez"" of the Chilean police, where he was serving a night detention sentence imposed by a court of the Republic, he was detained by police officers of the investigation service at the order of the naval prosecutor of Valparaso. The reason for his detention by the naval prosecutor was his presumed involvement in committing the offence of insulting the armed forces, as defined in section  of the Code of Military Justice. This offence occurred with the publication of an article in the weekly magazine run by Mr. Crdenas, edited and signed by Mr. Ivn Badilla. Both Mr. Juan Pablo Crdenas and Mr. Ivn Badilla were placed at the disposal of the court, which ordered their arrest and imprisonment in the Valparaso public prison. Once the statutory period of detention had expired, the naval prosecutor released Mr. Juan Pablo Crdenas on  May . As regards Mr. Ivn Badilla, the editor of the article considered to have insulted the armed forces, the prosecutor released him on bail on  June . Section  of the Code of Military Justice provides that ""persons guilty of committing an outrage against the national flag, seal or banner shall be sentenced to prison ... and anyone who, verbally or in writing, insults or offends army institutions, units, divisions or forces, or certain classes or corps thereof, shall be sentenced to prison ... or a fine ..."". Both Mr. Crdenas and Mr. Badilla were provided with legal advice by expert lawyers during these proceedings.
.The Government makes the following observations in its communication: neither Mr. Juan Pablo Crdenas nor Mr. Ivn Badilla are engaged in trade union activities and the reasons for their arrest have nothing to do with trade union activities. Moreover, it is not true that Mr. Juan Pablo Crdenas was violently abducted by heavily armed unidentified persons in civilian clothing and that his whereabouts were not known. He had been arrested, states the Government, on a court order by investigating police officers, who had identified themselves and behaved non-violently. He had been taken to the central police headquarters, a public, centrally located and well known place, and had been transferred the same day to the nearby port of Valparaso to be placed at the disposal of the court which had ordered his arrest; it is not true that special armed commandos arbitrarily arrested Mr. Ivn Badilla. According to the Government, his arrest was made at the order of a court investigating a presumed offence and his involvement in it. Those who had carried out the order for his arrest were officers of the investigating police, who had escorted him to central headquarters and later taken him to the port of Valparaso to place him at the disposal of the court. At no time were the lives or physical integrity of Mr. Juan Pablo Crdenas and Ivn Badilla in danger. Lastly, the Government has no further information to supply on this matter.
.The Government's communication refers to the aspect of the case mentioned by the ICFTU and the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers (CDT) in communications of April  which had remained pending at the last examination of this case (May-June ). The Government states that on Wednesday,  April , a minority group of workers employed in the railway enterprise (Empresa de Ferrocarriles), specifically  workers employed on the southern railways, held a ""warning strike"" in which they physically occupied the railway junction of the southbound railway,  kilometre from the central station, blocking the passage of passenger and freight trains. The objective of the strike, which involved physical occupation of the railway and a -hour interruption of railway traffic, was to make the following demands: the resignation of the director of the enterprise, Mr. Roberto Darrigrandi Chadwick; to put a stop to the",-1,1984,Chile
187,"system of private contractors in the railway enterprise; and that the Minister of Transport and Telecommunications received the striking workers. The Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications considered that pressure and a coercive attitude were unacceptable, especially when the illegal stoppage was only aimed at creating political problems for the Government on the eve of the national referendum. In fact, collective bargaining had been carried out and all of the economic or social demands had been met by the enterprise. Therefore this illegal strike, which was political in nature, cannot be viewed as the outcome of negotiations in the field of labour relations.
.The communication adds that, in view of the fact that this was an illegal work stoppage, which gave rise to problems and caused economic damage to the enterprise, the director of the enterprise, in resolutions dated ,  and  April , by virtue of the powers vested in him by the law, dismissed  workers who had taken part in the stoppage. The illegal stoppage ended on  April  and work was gradually resumed as from  April . This illegal stoppage resulted in a loss of income for the railway enterprise amounting to  million pesos in the form of freight and passengers not transported during the -day strike. By  August , the enterprise had reinstated  of the dismissed workers, after investigating their record. On  May , the dismissed workers brought a claim against the enterprise before the Fifth Labour Court of Santiago. The workers were counselled by a lawyer who was a specialist in the labour field. The court issued a first order for conciliation between the parties on  July . However, the representative of the enterprise who was present was not empowered to respond to the workers' demands, and no agreement was reached. The court again ordered the director of the enterprise to appear for conciliation on  August . However, this attempt at conciliation was also postponed at the request of the enterprise, as the board of directors of the railway enterprise was being set up and it was the latter which was competent to conciliate with the claimants. Lastly, the Government is surprised that it is the CDT which presents accusations of violation of freedom of association, since that organisation expelled its own secretary-general, Mr. Elas Madariaga, for having been a member of the Chilean delegation to the ILO, which does no credit to it as an example of observance of freedom of association. The Government has no other information to provide on this case.
.As regards the allegation presented by the Workers' Trade Union No.  of the Consorcio Periodstico de Chile SA (COPESA) which had not been concluded at the last examination of this case, the Government states in its communication that a visit of inspection had been carried out in this enterprise in order to verify the allegations and take measures to correct any irregularities, and a review had been made of the labour and social security regulations governing its employees. It was thus ascertained that the collective agreement concluded between the parties and currently in force is applied in full, including the clause providing for an adjustment of pay due on  March , which was paid in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As regards the dismissals referred to in the complaint, they had been carried out in accordance with section  f)of the Labour Code, and the persons affected had been paid all of the benefits to which they were entitled. Since the employment relationship had been terminated, there was nothing for the labour inspectorate to do. The investigation revealed that the employees had not been paid for overtime performed in the past six months, and therefore the employer had been instructed to redress this situation. This had been done by the employer on  May , when he paid ,, pesos to the workers concerned. It was also ascertained that contracts of employment had been made in writing and contained the stipulations required by the law and had been duly renewed. Lastly, all of the remuneration had been duly paid in cash to the employees, with a receipt signed by the latter, and there had been no miscalculations or undue deductions.
.The Government's communication also refers to the complaint presented by the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Textile and Allied Workers (CONTEXTIL) concerning the problems facing workers of the trade union of the Curtiembre Interamericana SA in concluding a collective labour agreement. The Government states that arrangements had been made for a labour inspector to visit the Curtiembre Interamericana SA enterprise with a view to verifying the allegations. During his visit, the inspector ascertained that a group of workers were engaged in collective bargaining and that they had been holding a legal strike since  March. In the course of collective bargaining, five workers resigned from the enterprise of their own accord as from  March  and signed their resignations on  April  in the presence of a notary public. The workers who had held the legal strike resumed normal work on  May  at  a.m. Lastly, as regards the alleged threats and persecution of workers involved in collective bargaining, the Government states that no complaints or charges on such grounds against the enterprise had been received by the municipal labour inspectorate.
.The Government's communication refers to the complaint presented on  June  by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), which it considers to be a de facto organisation whose representativity is not known, since it has no intention of acquiring legal personality as it is in opposition to the law. The communication of the CNT denounces the incidents which occurred in Valparaso on  May . The Government states in this regard that on  May , about  persons seriously disrupted the public order in Pedro Montt Avenue from Plaza  de septiembre to Plaza Victoria in Valparaso by interrupting pedestrian and automobile traffic, throwing leaflets on the public thoroughfare and stones and molotov cocktails at police officers and vehicles. These demonstrations and riots began around noon, following a religious service held in the church of Los Sagrados Corazones. Uniformed police proceeded to restore public order with appropriate personnel and methods; this was only achieved at about  p.m.
.As a result of these events,  persons were arrested for public disturbances and were placed at the disposal of the Third Local Police Court of Valparaso, which heard cases Nos. , and , and imposed fines and warnings. These persons were released on the same day at the same police station. None of those detained and placed at the disposal of the local police court suffered injuries or contusions of any kind, as was stated in the records, which they themselves signed. The police stations have no record of any injuries inflicted on Mr. Sergio Aguirre Martnez and Mr. Jos Gaete referred to in the complaint. After a thorough investigation, it was ascertained that Mr. Luis Borg and Mr. Fanor Castillo, referred to by the complainant, were not recorded in the police registers as having been arrested in connection with these incidents. The only person who was arrested for rioting was Mr. Florencio Valenzuela Corts, who was placed at the disposal of the Third Local Police Court of Valparaso, together with the other detainees as explained above. The Government has no further information to provide on this matter.
.The Government's communication also refers to the complaint presented by the College of Teachers of Chile and by the CNT in communications dated  May and  June  respectively, concerning the events which occurred on  May  in the town of Iquique. It states that on  May  an event commemorating ""Labour Day"" was being held in the ""Casa del Deportista"" in the port of Iquique, in the presence of the President of the Republic, the Minister of Labour, diplomatic officials and a large number of workers. Parallel to this, a religious service organised by the CNT was being held in the cathedral of Iquique in Obispo Labb street,  metres from the ""Casa del Deportista"". The mass ended at . p.m. and a number of persons gathered outside the church, yelling and shouting slogans against the Government and the armed forces. This group organised themselves to hold a march, clearly intending to pass in front of the ""Casa del Deportista"", towards the College of Teachers. Faced with this situation, a group of uniformed police warned them not to pass in front of the ""Casa del Deportista"" in order to avoid a confrontation with government supporters, but to no avail, so that they were obliged to use chemical deterrents in order to disperse the column and check its advance, compelling the marchers to turn into another street. The latter reorganised themselves in four groups and converged from different directions in front of the premises of the College of Teachers, in the middle of the",2,1984,Chile
188,"thoroughfare, five blocks from the ""Casa del Deportista"". About  persons gathered there. The police again warned them to disperse, since they were obstructing pedestrian and automobile traffic, but the warning went unheeded, and acts of verbal and physical aggression were committed against police officers, and stones and other contusive objects were thrown. The officer in command was knocked down and beaten on the ground, so that chemical deterrents had to be used again to disperse the crowd. About  persons entered the premises of the College of Teachers, from which they shouted insults and threw stones at police officers. During the incidents, tear-gas spread inside the building, so that the occupants had to break the window panes for ventilation and to avoid the ill effects of the gas; these window panes fell outside the building, as was attested by the local officer in command. As a result of the violence of the incidents,  persons were injured, including five police officers. The incident was reported to the military prosecutor of Iquique in police report No.  of  May  of the First Police Commissariat of Iquique, citing assault of policemen on duty. A total of  persons who had been involved in the riots were arrested and placed at the disposal of the local police court of Iquique by police report No.  dated  May . Of these  persons arrested for public disturbances, only three were identified as being teachers. It must be pointed out that the only mission of the police was to maintain public order and prevent excesses, and the Government categorically denies that they entered the premises of the College of Teachers in order to cause damage. It should be noted that on  April , the regional commander of Tarapac authorised the organisation called ""regional grouping of workers"" to hold a meeting marking Labour Day in the Tadeo Haenke sports complex between  a.m. and  a.m., after which they were to refrain from holding marches or gatherings and would be held responsible for any damage to public or private property which might be caused by the participants either during or after the event. The College of Teachers of Iquique brought a criminal suit against the police for ""damage, injuries and breaking and entering"" before the Second Law Court of Iquique, under case No. ,-. However, on  May, this court declared itself not competent and referred the suit to the military prosecutor, who is conducting it under case No. -. The military prosecutor is also conducting case No. -, on ""assault of police officers on duty"". Both cases are now at the indictment stage, and a large number of the persons involved in the incidents have made statements. It is possible that both suits will be merged into one, which would be conducted by the military prosecutor.
.As regards the Managing Director of Radio Iquique FM, Mr. Fernando Muoz Marinkovic, alleged to have been assaulted and to have sustained fractures in one arm as a result, the Iquique police headquarters reports that this person was admitted to the emergency room of Iquique Hospital at .  p.m. on  May, according to medical record No. ,, with the following diagnosis: ""observed fracture left elbow, medium severity"". Verification of police registers shows that no arrest was made or charges brought in connection with this person. In an interview with Mr. Muoz Marinkovic, the latter stated that he had sustained a fissure in his left elbow as a result of a fall which occurred as he was making a news report of the May Day incidents. In suit No. -, which is being conducted by the military prosecutor, police are accused of having damaged the building, pictures and chairs belonging to the College of Teachers. In this regard, teachers Italo Maniello, Javier Morales S., Juan Lima M., and Alicia Garca T., all of whom hold posts on the regional executive of the College of Teachers of Iquique, when questioned as to the cause of the damage, stated that those who had caused it ""were elements participating in the event held by the College of Teachers, for the purpose of blaming the violence unleashed on the police"". The persons arrested were released after being summoned to the local police court. It has already been explained to the Committee on Freedom of Association that in proceedings concerning public disturbances, those found guilty are fined small sums by the local police courts. Lastly, the Government has no further information to provide on this case.
.The Government's communication also refers to the complaint presented in communications dated  April,  May and  July  by the National Confederation of Federations and Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH) concerning anti-trade union pressure allegedly brought to bear by employers in the sector. The Government states that the Ministry of Labour has ordered an investigation by labour inspectors with a view to verifying compliance with labour legislation in this sector and penalising any infringements found to have occurred. The following enterprises were inspected:- the Savory-Montt and Company Limited Restaurant;- the Bali-Hai Restaurant;- the Vegetariano Restaurant;- the Carrera Hotel;- the Sheraton Hotel;- the Copasin Foodstore;- the ""Dos en Uno"" Foodstore;- Marriot Chile SA;- the Evercrisp Food Products Company.
.The Government's communication on this aspect of the case is fairly detailed and refers, in particular, to registration of attendance, employment contracts, bonuses, social security, dismissals and the trade union situation in these establishments; in the latter connection, the Government states that, as regards allegations of dissolution of trade unions, as the Committee has been aware since , in accordance with the amendments introduced in labour legislation, dissolution of a trade union, federation or confederation may be declared only by judgement of the law courts, in this case, of a judge of the Court of Appeal in whose jurisdiction the trade union is located. Thus, an end was put to the arbitrary practices which had prevailed in the country for over  years, and which had consisted in the administrative authorities being able to create and dissolve trade unions at their own discretion and according to their whim. The Government provides the following information on the trade union situation in this sector:a) Workers' Trade Union of the Violeta Peebles de Vera Company Limited Granted legal personality by Decree No.  of  January  of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. Its last trade union executive was elected on  July . It has temporarily suspended its activities and has not been dissolved by a court.b) Workers' Trade Union of the Claridge Hotel Limited Legal personality granted by Decree No.  of  January  of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. Its dissolution was ordered by a decision of  January  of the Court of Appeal of Santiago on the grounds, provided for by law, that for six months the number of members had fallen below that required for its constitution.c) Workers' Trade Union No.  of the Waldorff S.A. Restaurant and Rotisserie. This trade union was granted legal personality by Decree No.  of  May  of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. It has temporarily supended its activities; its last executive was elected on  November  and it has not been dissolved by a court decision.d) Workers' Trade Union No.  of Somontur Company Limited, Grand Hotel Isabel Riquelme. Legal personality was granted by Decree No.  of  October  of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. By court decision of  November , the Court of Appeal of Chilln ordered its dissolution on the grounds, established by law, that for six months the number of members had fallen below that required for its constitution.e) Workers' Trade Union of the CONIN Babyfood Corporation. Legal personality granted on  January  upon depositing its founding documents and by-laws with the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Santiago. The trade union is now operational and active; its last executive was elected on  June .f) Workers' Trade Union of the Prosit Soda Fountain Limited. Legal personality was granted by Decree No.  of  April  of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. Dissolution was ordered by the Court of Appeal of Santiago by a decision issued on  October , on the grounds that for six months the number of members had fallen below that required for its constitution.g) Workers' Trade Union No.  of the Autogrill Company Limited Restaurant. Legal personality was granted by Decree No.  of  April  of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. It has temporarily suspended its activities; its last executive was elected on  December ; it has not been dissolved by a court decision.h) Workers' Trade Union of the Rincn Alemn Company. Legal personality was granted on  June  upon depositing its founding documents and by-laws with the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Bo-Bo. The latter made observations concerning the",1,1984,Chile
189,"by-laws and granted the trade union the statutory period of  days to correct shortcomings; when this period expired, the organisation had neither complied nor appealed to the Labour Court; its legal status thus lapsed merely by operation of the law.
.The communication also refers to the dismissals of trade union leaders in this sector: Luis Bentez Galaz, Angel Cataln, Arsenio Angulo and Juan Montalbn. The Government states that, in the case of Luis Bentez, on  November  his employer, the Club de la Unin in Santiago, dismissed the leader of the Inter-enterprise Union of Workers in the Culinary Arts, Mr. Luis Bentez Galaz, on the grounds established by law, of serious failure to discharge the obligations laid down in his contract. Following a complaint by Mr. Bentez Galaz, on  November  the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Santiago ordered his reinstatement. When the enterprise refused to do this, an administrative penalty was imposed. Mr. Bentez subsequently lodged a claim with the th Civil Court of Santiago to declare his dismissal null and void on the ground of trade union immunity. On  October , the court handed down its decision to uphold the claim and order that his employment contract be restored and that he be paid remuneration for the period in which he was dismissed, failing which the employer would be ordered to pay the compensation due in respect of his trade union immunity and seniority. This decision was appealed against by the employer, but was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court; the latter ruled that there had been no error or miscarriage of justice when the decision had been handed down. On  August , Mr. Bentez lodged a petition for compliance with the same court against the Club de la Unin; the proceedings in the case are still under way. As regards the dismissal of trade union leader Mr. Angel Cataln M., the Government states that on  May  the latter lodged a complaint with the Municipal Labour Inspectorate of Santiago Sur on the grounds that the COPASIN enterprise where he was employed had not given him any work since  April . The Labour Inspectorate ordered the employer to appear on  May  for conciliation between the parties. At the meeting, the employer's representative stated that Mr. Cataln had, in a written minute signed in the presence of a notary public, requested unpaid leave from  December  to  May  and had requested advance payment of the seniority pay to which he was entitled. The representative added that the enterprise had paid him the sum of , pesos, i.e. half of the above-mentioned benefit, for the period from  November  to  November . The complainant, Mr. Cataln, stated that until  March  he had held the office of secretary-general of the National Confederation of Workers in the Food, Hotel and Allied Trades, and that he had been elected as from that date treasurer of the trade union of the enterprise, which was the reason why he had requested reinstatement, refused by the enterprise. The Inspector called upon the parties to come to an agreement, which, however, was not reached. Mr. Cataln was therefore instructed to lodge a claim against the enterprise with the ordinary law courts. As regards the dismissal of the trade union leader of this enterprise, Mr. Arsenio Angulo, the Government states that Mr. Angulo himself reported that his situation had been settled in  when he signed an agreement with the enterprise under which his contract was terminated in the most complete and reciprocal manner and his employer paid him , pesos compensation. As regards the situation of the head of the Inter-enterprise Union of the Restaurant and Hotel Trade, Mr. Juan Montalbn R., the Government states that on  March  the Provincial Labour Court of Santiago received a complaint from him alleging that he had been dismissed without justification despite is trade union immunity. On  April  a labour inspector visited the home of his employer in order to request her to show the legal authorisation empowering her to dismiss the complainant or, in the absence of such authorisation, to reinstate him immediately. However, this did not take place, since the employer was not at home. She was therefore summoned to appear at the Provincial Labour Inspectorate on  April . It was a representative who attended the summons, having been given power of attorney to represent the impugned employer. The employer's proxy stated that Mr. Montalbn had not been dismissed and could therefore return to his job. On the same occasion, she presented a request that the leader be stripped of his immunity, submitted to the Labour Court on  March . On  April , Mr. Montalbn appeared at the Provincial Labour Inspectorate offices and was handed the decision to the effect that he was to be reinstated in his job. On  April  Mr. Montalbn once again appeared at the Labour Inspectorate and stated that he had been assaulted by his employer's son and thrown out of the establishment. He had reported these events to the local police station. He also pointed out that he had required medical attention in the emergency room as a result of the injuries he had sustained. In view of these events, the impugned employee was summoned to appear on  April  at a hearing which Mr. Montalbn was to attend as well, as he was told verbally at the time. However, only the employer appeared on  April . In view of the fact that the worker concerned neither attended the hearing nor persisted in his complaint, no further action was taken, on the assumption that he had taken his case to the law courts, which are the only courts competent to try and give judgement on the presumed offence of assault and battery.
.The Government's communication also refers to the situation of the workers employed in the ""Dos en Uno"" Foodstore Limited, stating that an inspection carried out by a labour inspector had confirmed that a lawful strike had been held between  May  and  June  in the enterprise in the context of collective bargaining. Staff reductions carried out in this enterprise bore no relation to the collective bargaining process or to the lawful strike. The workers affected were paid the statutory compensation due.
.In a further communication dated  October , the Government refers to the dismissal of the trade unionist Jos Ruiz De Giorgio, stating that he was dismissed from the National Petroleum Company (ENAP) by virtue of section (f)of the Labour Code of . This section states that the employment contract shall be terminated in the following cases:f) Written renunciation by one of the parties which must be given to the other with at least  days' notice, with a copy to the respective Labour Inspectorate. Nevertheless, this prior notice is not necessary when the employer pays the worker compensation in cash equivalent to his last monthly wage.
.The Government states that the National Petroleum Company indicated that, rather than giving up Mr. De Giorgio's employment contract, it had exercised the right - which cannot be waived - provided for by law to the parties so as to enable the employment contract to be terminated at the wish of only one side without it being necessary to give justification or any further reasons for its exercise. On  August , Mr. De Giorgio brought court proceedings against the National Petroleum Company with a view to obtaining the payment of the compensation and benefits due to the Company's actions, claiming payment of compensation for termination of contract and years of service and renunciation. By acting in this way, the procedural correctness behind this dismissal relied on by the Company was recognised. On  September , Mr. De Giorgio reached a judicial agreement with the Company granting him full settlement and release of the two court cases concerning the Company: one case for the recuperation of wages and other monetary benefits in respect of which it was agreed that the employer pay the amount of , pesos; and the other case for the recuperation of compensation for years of service and renunciation in respect of which it was agreed that the Company would pay ,, pesos, an amount equivalent to approximately US$, (the Government's communication encloses copies of the judicial agreement and a memorandum concerning the liquidation of ENAP property dated  September ).
.The Government adds that on  September , Mr. De Giorgio, using the advice of a specialist lawyer lodged, by virtue of article  of the Constitution, an appeal for protection against the Company before the Appeal Court of Punta Arenas. This appeal alleged that his dismissal was unlawful and arbitrary. The Court agreed to receive the appeal and heard the parties on  and  September . In an unanimous decision, the Court rejected the appeal brought by Mr. De Giorgio",-1,1984,Chile
190,"and thus confirmed the legal and procedural correctness of the dismissal. On  September, Mr. De Giorgio's lawyers brought a further appeal before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Appeal Court; the Supreme Court unanimously confirmed the verdict of the Appeal Court of Punta Arenas. It was thus completely clear that the dismissal of Mr. De Giorgio was carried out legally and in accordance with the law.
.As regards the allegation that Mr. De Giorgio had been dismissed as a reprisal for his trade union activities, the Government states that since  October , Mr. De Giorgio no longer held any trade union post since he had not been elected to office in his first-level union. This meant that at the time of his dismissal under section (f)of the Labour Code, Mr. De Giorgio had, for over ten months, not been involved in trade union activities or held a post as trade union representative.
.As regards the ban on entering the country imposed on a number of trade unionists, the Committee notes that the Government has decided to remove  names from the list of such persons, including trade unionists Agustn Muoz and Juan Vargas Puebla. It also notes with interest Presidential Decree No.  of  September  which put an end to all administrative bans on entering the country arising from the state of emergency. In this respect, it requests the Government to supply information on whether this decree applies to Mr. Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro.
.As regards the legal situation of trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government that the sentence of internal exile (Bustos and Martnez) and the suspended sentence (Labraa) were handed down as the result of judicial proceedings and were not dictated by political considerations arising out of the appointment of these trade unionists to the executive of the recently constituted Single Central Organisation of Workers. The Committee also observes that the reason for the verdicts against the trade union leaders was their having called for a stoppage of activities on  October  in order to make socio-economic claims. The Committee, having examined the reasons for the sentence, nevertheless recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic and social interests. This right does not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also all problems of direct concern to the workers. The Committee notes with concern that sentences of internal exile and a suspended sentence have been imposed on these trade unionists under the State Security Act for having called a strike and recalls the principle that the detention and sentencing of workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests infringes the free exercise of trade union rights.
.As regards the allegations presented by Workers' Trade Union No.  of the Consorcio Periodstico de Chile SA (COPESA) concerning pressure brought to bear by the enterprise so that the trade union members would renounce the cost-of-living increases stipulated in collective agreements, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government that an inspection revealed that the current collective agreement was fully complied with, that the employer has paid overtime and that all remuneration has been duly paid. It also observes that, according to the Government, the dismissals of the persons mentioned by the complainant were carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. At all events, the Committee recalls that the Fact-finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association has emphasised that satisfactory labour relations depend primarily on the attitude of the parties towards each other and on their mutual confidence. It also considers that in cases in which it clearly appears that the dismissal of a worker was based on his trade union membership or activities, it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is accorded by legislation which enables employers to so act on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal.
.As regards the complaints presented by the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH) concerning alleged anti-union pressure brought to bear by employers on workers in the sector, the Committee notes the detailed information sent by the Government on inspections carried out in the establishments mentioned by the complainant and covering various aspects of labour relations in this sector. It also notes the information supplied on the dismissals of trade unionists Luis Bentez Galaz, Angel Cataln, Arsenio Angulo and Juan Montalbn and the resulting judicial proceedings. In this regard, the Committee would emphasise that, besides preventive machinery to forestall anti-union dismissals (such as, for example, a request for the prior authorisation of the labour inspectorate before carrying out a dismissal), a further means of ensuring effective protection could be to make it compulsory for each employer to prove that the motive for his intention to dismiss a worker has no connection with the worker's union activities.
.As regards the dismissal of  workers and  trade union leaders in the State Railway Enterprise because of a work stoppage on  April , the Committee observes that the Government maintains that this stoppage was held for political reasons and the complainant maintains that it was motivated by a failure to reply to socio-economic claims. The Government states that  of these dismissed workers were reinstated on  August  and that the remaining dismissed workers had instigated judicial proceedings against the enterprise. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the occupational and economic interests which workers defend through the exercise of the right to strike do not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the seeking of solutions to all the problems which are of direct concern to the workers. The Committee has also concluded that when trade unionists or union leaders are dismissed for having exercised the right to strike, they have been punished for their trade union activities and have been discriminated against.
.As regards the complaint presented by the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Textile and Allied Workers (CONTEXTIL) concerning the difficulties faced by workers belonging to the trade union of the Curtiembre Interamericana enterprise, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government concerning the inspection carried out by a labour inspector, who ascertained that the workers were engaged in a collective bargaining process and that they had been holding a lawful strike since  March; the Government also stated that no complaints had been lodged with the municipal labour inspectorate regarding unfair practices of the enterprise against the workers engaged in collective bargaining. In this regard, the Committee recalls the importance which it attaches to the principle that both employers and trade unions should bargain in good faith and make every effort to come to an agreement.
.As regards the alleged abduction of journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government that this was not an abduction, but an arrest pursuant to a warrant issued by a court investigating a presumed offence, that the arrest was made by the investigating police, and that the life or physical integrity of Mr. Crdenas was at no time in danger.
.As regards the arrest of trade union leader Mr. Freddy Nuez, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the arrest of Mr. Nuez bears no relation to his trade union activities, but was motivated by the discovery of explosives and a secret chamber in a house belonging to him. It also notes that Mr. Nuez was released unconditionally by the ad hoc prosecutor on  June , that he suffered no physical ill-treatment during his detention and interrogation and that he is now freely engaging in his activities.
.As regards the arrest of trade unionist Jorge Milln on the grounds of a march organised by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), of which he is the vice-chairman, the Committee observes that, according to the information supplied by the Government, his arrest was the result of a public disturbance caused by this march, and that he was apparently released by the police after having completed the statutory period of detention, without any legal proceedings having been instigated against him. In this regard, the Committee would emphasise the principle that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no charges are subsequently brought is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger which such detentions have for trade union activities.
.As regards the events which occurred in the towns of Iquique and Valparaso during the May Day celebrations, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government that police intervention was",-1,1984,Chile
191,"due to the public disturbances which occurred in both towns. As regards the alleged arrest of trade unionists Mr. Luis Borg and Mr. Fanor Castillo, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government that these persons had not been entered in police registers as having been arrested in connection with these incidents. Neither had trade unionists Sergio Aguirre Martnez and Jos Gaete been recorded in police registers as having been injured. The Committee also notes the fact that the College of Teachers of Chile lodged a criminal complaint against police officers for damage, injuries and breaking and entering at its premises in Iquique and that another suit had been brought for assault of police officers. In this regard, the Committee would recall that while trade unionists must observe legal provisions aimed at maintaining public order, the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of trade unionists to organise and hold their meetings freely; and that the right to organise public meetings and processions on May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights.
.As regards the complaint presented by the workers' trade union of the ""Dos en Uno"" foodstore, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government following an inspection made by a labour inspector, who ascertained that a lawful strike had been held between  May and  June  in connection with collective bargaining, and that staff reductions bore no relation to the collective bargaining process or to the lawful strike. In this regard, the Committee points out that mass dismissals of workers following a strike cannot be considered as an isolated event, and can lead to the conclusion that workers have been punished for their trade union activities and have been discriminated against.
.As regards the dismissal of the former trade union leader Mr. Jos Ruiz De Giorgio by the National Petroleum Company, the Committee takes note of the information presented by the Government to the effect that the dismissal took place under the legal provisions of the Labour Code and that all employment benefits were paid to him in accordance with the law. The Committee also notes that Mr. De Giorgio brought an appeal for protection before the Appeal Court alleging that his dismissal was illegal and that this was unanimously rejected by that Court and confirmed by the Supreme Court. The Committee reiterates the principle that it expressed in paragraph  above.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not supplied full information on the dismissal of a number of workers from the State Railway Enterprise and the  union leaders due to a strike there. The dismissed leaders are: Jos Criado, chairman of the National Federation of Railway Workers; Germn Daz, secretary of the Federation; Miguel Muoz, its secretary-general; Ceferino Barra, chairman of No.  Union; Juan Daz, secretary of that union; Rafael Rivera, its treasurer; Jos Ortega, director of No.  Union of Santiago; Guillermo Munizaga, also director of that union; Hugo Salinas, treasurer of the No.  Union of San Bernardo; Oscar Cabello, also director of that Union; Tito Ramrez, secretary of Trade Union No.  of Santiago; Juan Contreras, chairman of the No.  Traction Union; Jos Morales, secretary of that Union; Orlando Ganona, treasurer of that Union and Ivn Orellana and Luis Pradenas, both directors of that Union.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes that the Government has sent detailed replies to most of the allegations outstanding in this case.b) As regards the ban on entering the country imposed on various trade unionists, and in the light of Presidential Decree No.  which terminated the administrative bans on entering the country, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether the unionists Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro have benefited from the terms of this Decree and on developments in the trial concerning the reacquisition of Chilean nationality by the unionist Luis Meneses Aranda.c) The Committee notes with concern the sentencing to terms of internal exile and suspended sentence handed down against trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa and stresses that the arrest and sentencing of trade union leaders for activities related to the defence of their members' interests infringes the free exercise of trade union rights; it requests the Government to keep it informed of any change in the legal situation of these union leaders.d) As regards the further arrest of the journalist Juan Pablo Crdenas, the Committee notes that he was released on  May , when his detention reached the maximum period allowed by law, and requests the Government to inform it of the present legal situation of Mr. Crdenas, in particular to indicate whether court proceedings are under way for the suspected acts for which he had been held.e) As regards the arrest of trade union leader Freddy Nuez, the Committee expresses the hope that in the future he will be able to continue his trade union activities normally.f) As for the detention of the trade union leader Jorge Milln because of a march organised by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), the Committee deplores, in general, this type of measure since the arrest of trade union leaders against whom no charges are subsequently brought restricts the exercise of trade union rights; it requests the Government to make adequate provision so that the competent authorities receive instructions with a view to eliminating the danger which this type of detention holds for trade union activities.g) As regards the incidents in Valparaso and Iquique because of May Day celebrations, the Committee expresses its concern at the way in which International Labour Day festivities in both towns were disturbed and notes the contradictions existing between the complainants' allegations and the Government's observations on what happened in the two towns. It requests the Government to inform it of the decision in Florencio Valenzuela's case and on the court proceedings initiated by the College of Teachers of Iquique and by the police, respectively, which are being investigated by the military prosecutor.h) As regards the allegations presented by the Workers' Trade Union No.  of the Consorcio Periodstico de Chile SA (COPESA), the Committee notes that the Government inspected the labour company's documentation and found that the collective agreement in force was being fully applied; nevertheless, the Committee considers that in cases in which it clearly appears that the dismissal of a worker was based on his trade union membership or activities, it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is accorded by legislation which enables employers to so act on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal.i) As regards the alleged threats and persecution of workers in the Curtiembre Interamericana company who were involved in collective bargaining, the Committee notes that these workers did not present complaints to the labour authorities about these alleged actions; it, however, requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the bargaining proceedings.j) As regards the various allegations presented by the CTGACH, the Committee notes the detailed information provided by the Government, but would request specific observations on the alleged anti-union practices in this sector such as employer pressure to obstruct unionisation, unfair labour practices when trying to get bargaining rounds under way, mass dismissals of workers when they try to organise; as for the dismissal of trade union leaders Luis Bentez (Inter-enterprise Union of Workers in the Culinary Arts), Angel Cataln (Workers' Union of the COPASIN company) and Juan Montalbn (Inter-enterprise Union in the Restaurant and Hotel Trade of the Metropolitan region), the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the court proceedings they have brought for their reinstatement.k) As regards the allegations presented by the Workers' Trade Union in the ""Dos en Uno"" foodstore, the Committee would repeat that the mass dismissal of workers following a strike cannot be considered as an isolated event, and can lead to the conclusion that workers have been punished for their trade union activities and have been discriminated against.l) As regards the dismissal of former trade unionist Jos Ruiz De Giorgio, the Committee reiterates the principle expressed in subparagraph h)above.m) As regards the dismissal of a number of workers and  trade union leaders in the State Railway Enterprise after a strike, the Committee notes the Government's statement that on  August ,  of the  dismissed were reinstated and requests the Government for information on developments in the court proceedings brought by the dismissed workers and on the possible reintegration of the  dismissed trade union leaders.
.The Committee has examined this case on various occasions, most recently at its February  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. (See the th Report, paragraphs -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).)
.Subsequently, the ILO received the following communications from the complainants: COPESA (Consorcio",1,1984,Chile
192,"Periodstico de Chile, SA) Workers' Trade Union No. , of  January ; National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH), of  April and  May ; International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), of  and  April ; Workers' Democratic Confederation, of  April  and the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Chilean Textile and Allied Workers (CONTEXTIL), of  April . The Government transmitted its observations in communications of  March,  April and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its th Session in February-March , the Governing Body approved the Committee's recommendations relating to the numerous complaints of detention of trade unionists (specifically Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa) and requested the Government to keep it informed of developments as regards their legal position; to the refusal to allow several trade unionists (Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro) to enter the country, and requested the Government to keep it informed of the situation of Luis Meneses Aranda, particularly as regards the restoration of his Chilean nationality; and to the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers' Trade Unions and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez.
.In its communication of  January  the COPESA (Consorcio Periodstico de Chile, SA) Workers' Trade Union No.  reports that on  May  the Consorcio Periodstico de Chile, SA entered into a collective labour agreement with the COPESA Workers' Trade Union No. . The agreement was for a period of two years (from  May  until  April ), and provided that the workers' remuneration in force until  March  would be adjusted from  April  by a percentage equal to  per cent of the change in the consumer price index (a rise in the cost of living) for October, November and December  and January, February and March .
.The undertaking reached an agreement on the rescheduling of debts and loans at preferential rates of interest with the creditor banks, headed by the Banco del Estado de Chile (a State bank) which signed an agreement with the undertaking for the rescheduling and payment of its debts, as is shown by the officially registered document executed on  August . In spite of this agreement COPESA demanded that the members of the trade union forgo the wage increase payable as from  April , on penalty of dismissal. The complainant states that the undertaking's arbitrary demand that the workers withdraw their claim to the remuneration to which they are entitled on the grounds that it is not subject to compensation for inflation (which in  was at the rate of . per cent) infringes statutory provisions contained in the Labour Code and in international agreements. The workers refused to accept this demand of the undertaking, which on  January proceeded to dismiss  per cent of the members of each of the three trade unions existing in COPESA. The Workers' Trade Union No.  reacted to this softening up process by insisting on compliance with the collective agreement, which led to the dismissal of  more of its members on  February  and the announcement that a further  would be dismissed. The dismissals that took place after  January affected only workers in Trade Union No. , since, in view of the attitude adopted by the undertaking, Trade Unions Nos.  and  agreed to renounce the wage adjustment that was payable as from  April . The communication goes on to say that the members of Trade Union No.  are production workers whose salaries are the lowest in the undertaking and that the effect of the wage increase on the total payroll entails only a very slight outlay for the undertaking, but that the undertaking is determined not to adjust the wages of the members of Trade Union No.  to compensate them for the rise in the cost of living.
.The communication concludes by stating that as a result of the dismissals, the production staff have to work overtime without the proper rest periods and that their annual leave has been suspended; this shows how arbitrary the dismissals are. It is paradoxical that, while dismissing staff so as to put pressure on the workers and to avoid complying with the agreed wage adjustments, the undertaking has taken on fresh staff at a cost very similiar to the wages of the dismissed staff - most of the new engagements being of administrative staff with closer ties with the management of the undertaking.
.In a communication dated  April  the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Workers in the Food, Restaurant, Hotel and Allied Trades (CTGACH) denounces the overt pressure brought to bear by the employers through the management of each establishment to discourage unionisation in this sector. According to the complainant, as soon as workers show any sign of planning to organise themselves selective dismissals are made; the most active workers are summoned to the enterprise's administrative offices, and if the situation continues mass dismissals are ordered. This practice is especially common in small establishments employing up to  workers, where the employer habitually uses informers to prevent the workers from organising themselves and making subsequent demands for higher wages. The complainant adds that when workers go ahead with their decision to organise themselves, the employers dismiss all the persons concerned, or all the workers who in their opinion are the ringleaders. Collective agreements are used as a delaying tactic when workers plan to organise, but at the end of it all the workers very rarely still have their jobs. The complainant cites as examples the Savory, Bali Hai and Vegetariano establishments, adding that the workers who are not dismissed eventually give up in the face of the persecution to which they are subjected - jobs switched, longer hours, pay docked, etc. The complainant further alleges that undertakings in which there are established trade unions take advantage of the law to carry out mass dismissals, as occurred at the Hotel Carrera (where in   workers were dismissed) the Hotel Sheraton ( workers) the Copasin food store ( workers), the Dos en Uno food store ( workers) in  at the end of the collective bargaining process. The current legislation is also used to dissolve trade unions. In  alone, for example, trade unions were dissolved in the Violeta Peebles foodstuffs industry, the Hotel Claridge in Santiago, the Waldorf restaurant, the Hotel Isabel Riquelme-Chillan, the Conin company, the Prosit soda fountain and the Autogrill restaurant. The communication cites the typical example of the Rincn Alemn in the town of Los Angeles where the trade union was dissolved while the workers were engaged in collective bargaining and were protected by trade union immunity.
.The CTGACH states that notwithstanding the many obstacles in this sector the workers organise and maintain trade unions in many undertakings, with the result that the employers' strategy has now switched to that of summoning non-unionised workers to the personnel manager's office where they are warned that they are better off as they are and are offered individual contracts instead of the benefits of the collective agreement; the employers then tackle the unionised workers who are made to sign the said individual contracts under threat of dismissal.
.The complainant further adds that another method of breaking up trade unions in this sector is to contract work out: the employer contracts the services of outside undertakings (many of which are set up by their own executive) to take over the work of various sections and then dismiss the workers who were employed in them. There are several examples of this, such as the Marriot Chile undertaking where only  per cent of the staff are said to belong to the undertaking while the remaining  per cent work for various subcontractors, and the Hotel Carrera which has started turning over its various departments to subcontractors who currently employ nearly  per cent of the staff. This practice, the complainant alleges, makes all workers fear for their jobs and puts a stop to any form of organisation.
.The CTGACH communication affirms that the employers in this sector have begun to persecute and dismiss trade union leaders systematically, sometimes on unfounded ""grounds of dismissal"". It cites the following examples:- Three years ago the leader of the Culinary Arts Trade Union, Luis Humberto Bentez (now the CTGACH youth officer) was unjustifiably dismissed by his employer, the Club de la Unin in Santiago. Although he took all the appropriate legal measures and won his case on every occasion, the undertaking refuses to reinstate him in his employment.- Over the last two years the trade union leader in the Copasn undertaking, Angel Cataln (the Secretary-General",0,1984,Chile
193,"of the CTGACH), has been contesting his dismissal in court, but there is so far no possibility of his being reinstated.- Four years ago Arsenio Angulo, President of the trade union in the Autogrill restaurant, was dismissed; to date his case has not been settled.- Juan Montalbn, chairman of the Sindicato Interempresas de Santiago (Santiago Inter-Enterprise Trade Union) was dismissed two months ago and his employer refuses to reinstate him; in this case it must be said that the labour inspectorate has not been as efficient as it should have been. These are the most notorious cases. Moreover, in the provinces, where all kinds of pressure are brought to bear by employers, many trade union leaders are giving up their union posts and not taking their cases to court because it is impossible to obtain any effective or prompt action.
.The complainant's communication also refers to the inter-enterprise trade unions, whose members often work in small establishments with a single owner who in many cases changes the firm's company registration for the sole purpose of avoiding the formation of trade union. These trade unions have repeatedly denounced the absence of collective agreements, failure to pay the minimum legal wage, and imposition of working days of up to  hours without any overtime pay; when a worker complains, there are immediate reprisals and the worker has to overcome a host of bureaucratic obstacles to get paid. When a complaint is filed with the labour inspectorate the employer denies any connection with the worker, who then has to take his case to the labour courts. In these circumstances, the worker usually leaves his job without taking any steps to enforce his rights, because he cannot afford the cost of all the legal formalities of hiring lawyers, etc.
.In a further communication dated  May , the CTGACH sends additional information on the refusal to grant May Day, which happened to fall on a Sunday, by the Hotel Carrera; on attacks against trade union leaders; on the case of Humberto Bentez who has not been reinstated although his court case was successful; on trade union leader Juan Montalbn Lopez (Chairman of the Provincial Restaurant Union) who was ordered by the Labour Inspectorate to present himself at his workplace for reinstatement and, not having accepted the working conditions imposed by his employer, who is chairman of the group of soda fountain and restaurant owners, was violently treated by her son and now is without work. The CTGACH raises other cases of dismissals after concluding collective agreements:a) Francisco de Aguirre Hotel-Serena: negotiations finished on  April after ten days' strike with an undertaking from the company not to engage in reprisals; however, to date five dismissals have occurred all based on ""operational requirements of the company"".b) Evercrisp Food Products Company: for over three years the workers have been trying to organise, with the company dismissing the most committed workers whenever it discovered their intentions; on  April four workers were dismissed for ""operational requirements of the company"".c) Central de Restaurant Company: one of its executives is an ex-union leader and whenever even the slightest action is attempted, he calls the workers to the company's central offices where they are threatened and, if there is a hint that they are unionised, dismissed. In each of the company's casinos there are informants who use information on past events to bring charges against possible organisers.
.In a communication of  April  the ICFTU denounces the dismissal by the Chilean authorities of  trade union leaders and more than  workers from the state railways. The trade unions in the state railways had petitioned the Government for various social and economic improvements and, having failed to obtain any reply, called a strike. The ICFTU adds that among the dismissed trade union leaders were Miguel Muoz and Jos Criado of the Comando Nacional de Trabajadores (National Grouping of Workers). In a further communication dated  April , the ICFTU states that faced with the agreement of the railway workers' unions to go on a warning strike on  April  in support of calls against the privatisation of the undertaking, government and management authorities replied by dismissing  union leaders and  unionised workers. This company measure obliged the unions to commence an unlimited strike on  April . The dismissed union leaders are:- Jos Criado. President (Fed. Nacional Trabaj. Ferroviarios)- Germn Daz. Secretary (Fed. Nacional Trabaj. Ferroviarios)- Miguel Muoz. Secretary General (Fed. Nacional Trabaj. Ferroviarios)- Ceferino Barra. President (Sindicato Nmero )- Juan Daz. Secretary (Sindicato Nmero )- Rafael Rivera. Treasurer (Sindicato Nmero )- Jos Ortega. Director (Sindicato Nmero  de Santiago)- Guillermo Munizaga. Director (Sindicato Nmero  de Santiago)- Hugo Salinas Treasurer. (Sindicato Nmero  de Bernardo)- Ren Vilches Director. (Sindicato Nmero  de Bernardo)- Oscar Cabello Director.

.In a communication of  April  the Central Democrtica de Trabajadores (Workers' Democratic Confederation) denounces the dismissals of trade union leaders and workers from the Chilean state railways, ordered by the Director of that undertaking, and adds that the dismissals are on the increase because they are supported by the Ministry of Transport and the Minister of Labour - which is a violation of trade union immunity and of the right to work.
.In a communication of  April , CONTEXTIL refers to problems facing workers of the Trade Union of the Curtiembre Interamericana Company and its own national executive council in the collective bargaining which has just come to an end with the Company. It states that for many years the workers of the Company have been seeking solutions to their wages, social and labour problems always finding, through collective bargaining, understanding of its problems by the Company. On  February ,  workers presented their claims in a collective agreement in accordance with the law, but the Company refused to receive it forcing the negotiating committee to turn to the labour bodies so that a labour inspector would officially present the draft agreement to the Company. From this moment on the employer engaged in a series of unfair labour practices against the workers involved in the draft, such as changes of places of work with salary drops, the dismissal of the Company's secretary, Mrs. Estela Miranda, being blamed as being behind the presentation of the draft and her arrest by unknown persons who threatened her for her participation in the lawful strike which, at that date, was  days' old. The Company was still refusing to find a solution to the labour dispute, hiding behind the labour legislation contrary to the interests of the workers.
.In its communication of  March  the Government comments that it is surprised at the way standard procedure is abused in order to accuse a member State, often irresponsibly and solely for the purpose of having the Government condemned. The Government's communication maintains that many alleged violations of freedom of association are not violations at all, and at most amount to non-compliance with, or infractions of the ordinary penal law, that the normal courts are competent to handle and judge. The Government expresses concern because, it claims, the complaint attempts to represent as the sole representatives of the Chilean trade union movement a small group of persons whose names constantly and repeatedly appear in complaints to international organisations. The Government states that on  December  there were in Chile , trade union officials leading , workers belonging to , trade unions,  federations and  national confederations, and it is hard to see how the , leaders of the Chilean trade union movement can be said to be encountering difficulties when at most only a dozen are cited in the complaints made to international organisations. It might be argued that they are leaders of powerful trade unions that are very representative of the trade union movement; but the best known of them, Manuel Bustos, was elected by  votes in his trade union, which has  members. The Committee regularly receives complaints against police action that is taken to maintain order and to enforce respect for the freedom of movement of pedestrians and vehicles. The complainants consider that public demonstrations can bring about better working conditions and resolve economic and social policy issues. But the Government states that it cannot regard as legitimate public demonstrations involving the stoning of public transport vehicles, the setting up of barricades, the incitement of parents not to send their children to school, the injuring of members of the police force, the violent death of children and innocent persons, and substantial damage to public and private property. The Government cannot call such ""demonstrations"" legitimate, especially when their purpose is to destabilise the Government by making the country ungovernable.
.The",2,1984,Chile
194,"Government refers to the ban on various trade unionists from entering the country and states that Rolando Caldern A. and Hernn del Canto R. are in exile because they sought refuge in an embassy in . Both held political posts as Ministers of State in the Allende Government and both, along with Mario Navarro, are barred from entering the country. The Government is constantly reviewing the list of persons in exile in with a view to their return. The exile of the persons named has nothing to do with any supposed trade union activities but only with activities engaging their political responsibility. As regards Luis Meneses Aranda, the communication states that on  December  he was authorised to enter the country and was granted a temporary visa for  days so that once in the country he could arrange for his temporary or permanent residence and regularise his situation as regards the loss of his Chilean nationality. When Chilean nationality has been lost it may be reacquired by law, in accordance with article  of the Political Constitution.
.Lastly, the Government refers to the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers' Trade Unions and on the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez; it states that there is no record either with the police or in the courts of any such occurrence and that the persons allegedly affected have not lodged any complaint or appealed to the law courts.
.In its communication of  April  the Government provides information on the legal position of the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, stating that the appeal instigated by the defendants' lawyers was heard by the Second Chamber of the Santiago Court of Appeal, where the pleas of the parties' lawyers were heard and a settlement was reached. On  March  the Second Chamber of the Santiago Court of Appeal found for the appellants, quashed the verdict of the Court of First Instance appealed against, and acquitted Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa of the offences referred to in section  of the State Security Act. These persons are still at liberty and are enjoying all their trade union rights.
.With regard to the comments made by the Government in its communication of  March  on the alleged abuse of the supervisory procedures, and in particular the complaints of violations of freedom of association submitted to the Committee, in order to obtain condemnation of the Government, and on the representative character within the trade union movement of persons whose names frequently appear in such complaints, the Committee wishes to recall that, since it was formed, it has always stressed that the function of the International Labour Organisation as regards freedom of association and protection of the individual consists in promoting the effective application of the general principles of freedom of association, which is one of the principal guarantees of peace and social justice. Its function consists in guaranteeing and promoting freedom of associaton of workers and employers, not in bringing accusations against governments or condemning them. In carrying out its task, the Committee has always been particularly careful to apply the procedure developed over the years and to avoid exceeding its terms of reference. To avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, the Committee has thought it necessary to recall that its functions are limited to examining the complaints submitted to it; it is not called upon to formulate general conclusions on the trade union situation in particular countries on the basis of vague generalisations, but to assess the merit of the specific allegations made.
.As for the ban on the re-entry into Chile of Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro, the Committee notes the Government's repeated statements that the list of persons in exile is constantly being revised so as to allow their return. The Committee also notes the Government's claim that their exile has nothing to do with any supposed trade union activities but only with activities engaging their political responsibility. In this respect the Committee wishes to recall that the forced exile of trade unionists is contrary to human rights and is a serious matter as it deprives them of the possibility of working in their own country; moreover, it is a violation of freedom of association, as trade union organisations are weakened by being deprived of their leaders. Furthermore, the Committee wishes to recall, in view of the close relationship between freedom of association and basic human rights, that the ban on entry into the country imposed on certain trade unionists is contrary to the provisions of international instruments on this subject. Thus article () of the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights states that ""no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country"", and article () of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that ""everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.""
.As regards the situation of the trade unionist Luis Meneses Aranda, the Committee notes the Government's statement that he was granted a temporary -day visa on  December  so as to be able to regularise his situation as regards reacquisition of his Chilean nationality. The Committee hopes that, in accordance with the legislation, Chilean nationality will be restored to the trade unionist Meneses Aranda shortly.
.As regards the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers' Trade Unions and on the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez on  May , the Committee notes the Government's observation that the persons allegedly affected have not submitted any complaint or filed any lawsuit and that the police have no record of any such occurrence.
.As regards the legal situation of the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, the Committee notes with interest the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the Second Chamber of the Santiago Court of Appeal upheld the appeal instigated by the defence counsel of Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa, quashed the verdict of the Court of First Instance condemning them, and acquitted these trade union leaders.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not sent its observations on certain allegations submitted in this case, namely: on the communication of the COPESA Workers' Trade Union No.  relating to the dismissal of members of that trade union who resisted pressure brought by the undertaking to make them give up a wage increase due as compensation for the rise in the cost of living which had been agreed on in a collective agreement made with the undertaking; on the complaint submitted by the CTGACH regarding the pressure brought to bear by the employers on workers in this industry to prevent them from forming an organisation; on the mass dismissals after the conclusion of collective agreements; on the dissolution of trade unions in this sector; on the pressure brought to bear by employers to force workers to sign individual contracts instead of enjoying the benefits of collective agreements and on the use of subcontracting as a means of avoiding unionisation; on the dismissal of trade union leaders and the situation in inter-enterprise trade unions; on the complaint submitted by the ICFTU and the Workers' Democratic Confederation relating to the dismissal of  trade union leaders (including Miguel Muoz and Jos Criado of the National Grouping of Workers (CNT)) and more than  workers of the state railways for having petitioned the Government on socio-economic demands and for having called a strike when no reply was made to their petition; on CONTEXTIL's allegations of difficulties facing workers in the Union of the Curtiembre Interamericana Company in concluding a collective agreement with the Company and the latter's unfair labour practices against workers involved in the negotiating committee for the draft collective agreement.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations;a) In connection with the ban on re-entering the country imposed on various trade union leaders, and specifically Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro, the Committee again urges the Government to rescind this ban and to keep it informed of developments in this situation.b) As regards the situation of the trade unionist Luis Meneses Aranda, the Committee expresses the firm hope that his Chilean nationality will be restored to him shortly in accordance with the law, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.c) As regards the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers' Trade Unions and on the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there is no record of any such occurrences nor complaint made in connection with these alleged events.d) As regards the legal situation of the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, the Committee notes with interest the verdict of not guilty rendered",-1,1984,Chile
195,"by the Santiago Court of Appeal and expresses the hope that these trade union leaders will continue in the future the normal exercise of their trade union rights.e) Finally, the Committee invites the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which no reply has been given.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. (See the rd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).)
.Subsequently, the ILO received the following communications from the complainants: National Grouping of Workers (CNT):  October and  November ; World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  November and  December ; International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  and  November  and  and  January and  February ; World Confederation of Labour (WCL):  December ; and International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW):  December . The Government transmitted observations in communications of  October,  and  November , and  and  January and  and  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.During the most recent examination of the case, several allegations presented by the WCOTP, the ICFTU, the IFPAAW and several national confederations remained pending.
.In a communication of  October  the WCOTP referred to the arrest of Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing on  September .
.In its communication of  February , the WCOTP reported that on  February  Luis Muoz, a trade union leader of the Teachers' College of Chile in Valparaso, received an anonymous telephone call informing him that unless he and Andrs Reyes of the AGECH, Hugo Guzmn, leader of the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar, Mara Isabel Torres, leader of the Fifth District Teachers' College, Sergio Narvez and Florencio Valenzuela, President of the Workers in Commerce Trade Union, left the country before the month of March, action would be taken against them and their families; he interpreted this as a threat to their lives.
.In its communication of  March , the ICFTU alleged that on  March  a peaceful national mobilisation of workers convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) to request an increase in wages, an end to the massive dismissal of teachers, an end to the privatisation of nationalised enterprises, and the respect of human and trade union rights, was violently broken up by police forces; among the injured were Manuel Bustos, the then Vice-President of the CNT, and Rodolfo Seguel, President of the CNT, who was later arrested along with Manuel Rodrguez and Luis Surez, leaders of the same organisation.
.In its communication of  June , the Unity Confederation of Chilean Workers (CUT) furnished new information concerning the complaints presented by the ICFTU, WCL, WFTU, and WCOTP, concerning the murder of Jos Carrasco Tapia, a trade union leader of the Metropolitan Journalists' Council, on  September ; the arrest and ill-treatment of Rodolfo Seguel, President of the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), of Jorge Pavez, President of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) and Guillermo Azula, national leader of the AGECH, on  March , during a peaceful demonstration for the reinstatement of , teachers dismissed in ; the imprisonment in the Santiago Penitentiary of the following miners: Domingo Alvial Mondaca, Adran Cabrera R., Jos Delgado Z., Pedro Lobos P., Dagoberto Lpez R., Ricardo Mondaca G., Mario Santibez, Emilio Vargas M., Ral Vsquez I., Domingo Araya C., Armando Irrazbal C., Sergio Jeria I., Juan Jorguera I., Erasmo Mayolinca Ch., Marcos Sala B., Leonardo Torres G. and Yuri Vargas A., for participating in protest days calling for the respect of labour rights and denouncing tragic accidents in coal mines; appeals for relief filed by the leaders of the Federation of Trade Unions of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers before the Court of Appeals on  July , to denounce the assault against Angel Arriagada Arriagada, a leader of the Federation, on  April , and the search of the trade union office and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez on  May ; the attempted homicide of Juan Espinoza, a national trade union leader of the Confederation of Maritime Workers (CONGEMAR), when his house was set on fire while and he and his family were sleeping, in January ; the refusal to allow several CUT trade union leaders to enter the country; the arrest of former trade union leaders Luis Guzmn, who is being illegally detained at the Santiago Penitentiary for having entered the country without the Government's prior authorisation in early , and Mireya Baltra, a former national trade union leader of the CUT, who was illegally arrested in Puerto Aysn for having entered the country on  May ; the arrest and disappearance of Sergio Ruz Lazo, a former textile trade union leader, following his return to Chile in . The Government also continues to refuse to allow many trade unionists to enter the country, including: Rolando Caldern Aranguiz, former General Secretary of the CUT, and Hernn del Canto Riquelme, Luis Meneses Aranda, Mario Navarro Castro, Bernardo Vargas Fernndez, all former CUT national leaders.
.In its communication of  August , the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Chilean Textile and Allied Workers (CONTEXTIL) described the difficulties encountered by the workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise in signing a new collective agreement, and the enterprise's refusal to recognise the workers' representatives, as well as the unfair practices undertaken by the enterprise in transferring machinery and personnel from another of its plants in order to replace the workers who were legally on strike.
.In its communication of August , the National Confederation of Trade Unions, Federations and Associations of Chilean Workers in the Private Sector (CEPCH) denounced certain legal provisions (article , paragraph , article , paragraph , and article  of the Constitution of , Act No.  concerning political parties, section  of the Penal Code, and section  and section , paragraph , of the Labour Code), which make the holding of trade union office incompatible with affiliation in a political party, and require elected trade union leaders to sign an affidavit concerning any political affiliation.
.In its communication of  September , the IFPAAW alleged that Eugenio Eduardo Len Gajardo, President of the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants (CNC), was informed by the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Santiago that he was not eligible to serve as President of the CNC, despite his constitutional election at the Confederation's most recent congress, on the grounds that he had been arrested and subsequently charged under the National Security Act with participating in the mobilisation of workers as a trade union leader.
.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU referred to the arrest and assault at the hands of security forces of dozens of workers and trade unionists, after the authorities refused to authorise a national day of protest called by the CNT for  October , and denounced numerous threats to the lives of CNT leaders, and in particular against its President, Manuel Bustos, as well as the Ministry of the Interior's judicial summons of CNT leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, and their subsequent imprisonment in the Santiago Penitentiary, following their interrogation by a judge of the Supreme Court on  October .
.At its th Session in November , the Governing Body approved, among others, the following recommendations of the Committee:a) as regards the proceedings against Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing for breach of Act No.  on arms control, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in these proceedings and the outcome of the case;b) the Committee urges the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which no replies have yet been received.
.In its communication of  October , the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) alleges that on  October  the Government of Chile, acting through the Ministry of the Interior, filed suit against Manuel Bustos, President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) and the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), and Vice-President of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH); against Arturo Martnez, General Secretary of the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), Vice-President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Centre (CNS) and President of the National Graphics Confederation (CONAGRA); and against Moiss Labraa, member of the National Executive Council and dispute officer of the CNT and Vice-President of the National Miners' Confederation, for breach of the State Security Act in connection with the call for a general strike on  October . The Government charged the trade union leaders with inciting riots, provoking disturbances and calling for work stoppages, which led the Preliminary Hearings Officer of the Court of Appeals of Santiago to indict them and order their arrest. Their attorneys' request for release on",0,1984,Chile
196,"bail was denied.
.The CNT communication adds that the CNT, in agreement with its Council of Confederations, Associations and National Trade Unions (CONFASIN), called a general strike for  October , primarily to request a solution to the vital problems affecting workers, which continue to worsen owing to the economic and social policies of the military regime. These demands, although repeatedly presented to the Government, received no reply; the workers therefore were compelled to resort to a strike in the forms of absenteeism, temporary work stoppages, tardiness, early departure and slow-downs.
.The CNT communication also states that trade union leader Manuel Bustos has received death threats by phone and in writing, before and after the above-mentioned general strike; he filed a request for protection which was granted by the courts of law. Despite this request, the threats have continued in such forms as telephone calls to the CNT and to certain media, and threats sent to his trade union office and to his attorneys. Mr. Bustos' current place of confinement (the Santiago Penitentiary) does not offer any security as regards his physical integrity; for this reason he has requested that he be transferred to the penitentiary's annex, but to no avail. The communication concludes by requesting the ILO to demand that the Government immediately release trade union leaders Bustos, Martinz and Labraa, who have acted only in fulfilment of their trade union responsibilities; the communication encloses a handwritten letter sent from the penitentiary by the above-mentioned trade unionists, which reiterates the allegations presented by the CNT in its communication.
.In its communication of  December , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) associates itself with the complaint presented by the CNT on  October .
.In another communication dated  November , the CNT states that, upon the appeal of the trade union leaders, the Court of Alzada upheld the first instance conviction of the above-mentioned CNT trade union leaders, but modified the legal grounds for the conviction. As a result, Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa face charges of inciting and inducing a strike and paralysing trade, production and public services.
.In its communication of  November the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) expresses its concern and denounces the imprisonment of CNT trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, for calling the general strike of  October . In another communication of  December , the WFTU expresses its concern over the Chilean Government's decision to strip Mrs. Carmen Pinto, President of the External Affairs Committee of the CUT, of her Chilean citizenship.
.Likewise, the ICFTU communication of  November  denounces the imprisonment of the CNT trade union leaders with common criminals, and the continued death threats against Manuel Bustos; one of these threats came from a terrorist group known as ACHA, announcing his execution on  November. The communication adds that the Government refuses to transfer the trade union leaders and prevents them from receiving foreign visitors.
.In another communication of  November , the ICFTU denounces new repressive measures which the Government has taken against Chilean trade union leaders, referring in particular to the case of Carmen Pinto, a former trade union leader of the CUT in Concepcin, who currently resides in Paris; on  November  the authorities of the Chilean Embassy in France refused to renew her passport, arguing that, pursuant to the legislation of , Mrs. Pinto was no longer a Chilean citizen, without explaining the reasons for this in writing. The ICFTU communication adds that there are other unresolved cases of trade union leaders who have been arbitrarily stripped of their citizenship, citing the case of trade unionist Luis Meneses, a current official of the ORIT.
.In another communication of  January , the ICFTU reports that on  December  the Chilean Government published a list containing the names of  exiled Chilean citizens, authorising them to return to the country. This list included the name of trade unionist Luis Meneses, regional officer of the ORIT, who had been arbitrarily stripped of his citizenship by virtue of Decree No. ---, signed by the President of the Republic; his citizenship has not yet been restored. The communication states that the Government refuses to give him his passport, and has only authorised him to visit the country on a temporary basis under special visa.
.In its communication of  December , the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) states that the Labour Directorate has withdrawn its objections to Mr. Eugenio Len Gajardo's accepting the presidency of the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants, and thanks the ILO for its efforts in this connection.
.In its communication of  January , the ICFTU states that Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez, trade union leaders of the CNT, were sentenced on  January to  days' imprisonment for breach of a section of the State Security Act which prohibits calling for a national paralysation of work. Moiss Labraa, Vice-President of the CNT, was sentenced to  days' imprisonment. The communication also states that on  January, at . in the morning, police forces entered the residence of Manuel Bustos for the purpose of arresting him. According to the police, Mr. Bustos was to be taken to the Public Prosecutor's Office; the ICFTU adds that it does not appear that this incident is related to the ruling handed down by the examining magistrate in the case.
.In a communication of  February , the ICFTU expresses its gratitude for the ILO's intervention and states that Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa were released on the same day that they were detained, on  January .
.In its communication of  October , the Government refers to the CUT communication of  June  and states that the self-styled ""Unity Confederation of Chilean Workers"" does not have legal or de facto existence in Chile, and that its presumed leaders have not been elected by the Chilean workers whom they claim to represent; moreover, it does not have a domicile in the country nor a trade union base. As regards Jos Carrasco Tapia, the editor of a weekly publication, he was found dead on a public road on  September ; the Court of Appeals of Santiago appointed a senior magistrate to investigate the cause of his death, identify the authors of the crime, and punish them, but no progress has been made to date. There is no information available concerning the presumed trade union activities of the deceased.
.As regards Messrs. Jorge Pavez and Guillermo Azula, who were allegedly arrested in March , the Government reports that Mr. Pavez was arrested on  March , along with five other persons, for attempting to prevent the flow and traffic of persons and vehicles on a public thoroughfare; he was released immediately thereafter by the police, after having been summoned by the Local Police Court, which is entrusted with examining misdemeanors and levying small fines for traffic violations. As regards Mr. Azula, there are no records of his arrest and he is currently free. Nor are there any records whatsoever of the alleged ill-treatment of these persons.
.As regards Domingo Alvial Mundaca, he is on trial in the First Court of Santiago on charges of illegal possession of explosives and detonators and the performance of terrorists acts. As regards Adrin Cabrera R., Jos Delgado Z., Pedro Lobos P., Dagoberto Lpez R., Ricardo Mondaca G., Mario Santibez, Emilio Vargas M., Ral Vsquez I., Domingo Araya C., Armando Irarrzabal C., Sergio Jeria I., Juan Jorquera I., Erasmo Mayolinca Ch., Marcos Sala B., Leonardo Torres G. and Yuri Vargas A., presumed miners who are allegedly being held at the Santiago Penitentiary for having participated in a protest day, there are no records to support these nebulous and unfounded accusations: the Santiago Penitentiary is a correctional facility which houses delinquents who have been condemned by criminal courts to terms of imprisonment, and not persons who have allegedly invoked labour rights.
.As regards the alleged search of the office of the Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers' Trade Union Federation on  May , as well as that of the home of Alejandro Olivares Prez, there are no records or information concerning these alleged illegal searches; in any event, if they took place, it was not at the orders of any government authority.
.As regards the alleged assault on Angel Arriagada Arriagada, which is reported to have occurred in somewhat vague circumstances on  April , the Government can provide no information. In any event, the person concerned has the right to request that the Criminal Judge open an investigation, sanction the guilty parties and require the payment of damages. To the Government's knowledge, no criminal suit has been filed in this matter.
.As regards Juan Espinoza and the allegation that some one attempted to set fire to his house in January , while he and his family were sleeping, the Government has no information whatsoever. The alleged crime would fall under the provisions of the Criminal Code. Mr. Espinoza is free to file charges in the corresponding Criminal Court.",-1,1984,Chile
197,"Serious penalties are prescribed for the crime of arson; the Government is unaware of any suit or criminal charges filed in this connection.
.As regards Luis Guzmn, he is being tried by the Third Public Prosecutor of Santiago in Case No. / for crimes punishable under Act No.  of  on the control of arms and explosives; other charges punishable under the Criminal Code of which he is accused include the forgery of public documents and entering the country surreptitiously at other than a legal border crossing. Thus, charges that he has been illegally imprisoned are unfounded, since his detention was ordered by the courts in the light of the crimes with which he is charged.
.As regards Sergio Ruiz Lazo, he was authorised to enter the country on  June . He has not been, and is not now, under arrest. Border police records do not contain any information concerning the illegal entry of these persons into the country, since they crossed the border at unauthorised locations. As regards Mireya Baltra Moreno, she is in the country and enjoys complete freedom. As regards Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, a former Minister of Agriculture, Hernn del Canto Riquelme, a former Minister of the Interior, and Mario Navarro Castro, their names appear on a list of persons who are barred from entering the country. The Government is currently reviewing the circumstances of all persons who are barred from entering the country with a view to lifting this restriction.
.In another communication of  November , the Government furnishes information concerning several allegations in this case, in particular concerning the alleged detention of persons which is claimed to have taken place on  October , as well as the alleged threats received by Manuel Bustos, and the court summons of Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa in connection with their liability for injury to private individuals and damage to public and private property resulting from a day of social protest which they instigated. The Government's communication states in this connection that it is not true that security forces carried out dozens of arrests or assaulted workers on  October . According to the Government, Manuel Bustos, together with Messrs. Martnez and Labraa instigated and called a day of social protest with the objective of completely paralysing all activities in the country, under the pretext that the Government had not favoured their requests to put an end to the sale of state enterprises to national and foreign entities; to find a solution to the debt of families which had purchased housing through long-term mortgages with monthly payments; to repeal the current budgeting system; to organise collective bargaining by branch of activity; to enact legislation requiring employers to pay a minimum wage equivalent to $,, which would represent an increase of  per cent; to adjust wages; to pay bonuses for national holidays; to readjust pensions, etc.
.The Government's communication goes on to describe in detail how it is seeking to comply with many of the demands presented by workers. The Government adds that Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa considered that the Government had not responded favourably to their exorbitant and unfounded requests; they joined forces with a group of leaders of opposition political parties and with student organisations, in calling for a day of social protest on  October , which was designed to paralyse all activities throughout the country by disrupting the public order through public demonstrations in the streets, this action led to the blocking of traffic, disorder on public thoroughfares, attacks on uniformed police, the death of three persons, numerous injuries, and substantial damage to private and public property, as well as violent demonstrations, which significantly perturbed the country's public order and tranquility. One of the means used to paralyse activities was to prevent workers from gaining access to their places of work by means of numerous assaults on city buses and other means of public transportation, preventing them from keeping to their schedules and itineraries. The outcome of this action was reported by the trade union leaders of the National Confederation of Land Transport Workers of Chile (CONATRACH); specifically,  passenger vehicles were completely destroyed,  buses and mini-buses suffered considerable damage and were withdrawn from service pending repairs, and , drivers of these vehicles have been temporarily laid off. In addition to the death of three persons, one of them a two-year old child, two policemen were seriously injured.
.The Government's communication adds that it is not true that the authorities denied permission for the  October day of protest; rather, the persons instigating and convening the day of protest failed to request authorisation pursuant to police regulations and standard practice throughout the world, in spite of the fact that the decision to call this day of protest had been taken on  August . On the basis of these facts, which led to public concern and significant damage, as well as the death of innocent persons and assaults on uniformed police, the authorities issued a judicial summons alleging the breach of sections , subsection a)and , subsection (a), c)and (i), of Act No.  concerning national security, which has been in effect since . The Court of Appeals of Santiago appointed an examining magistrate to investigate these crimes under case -; on  October, Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa were indicted in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedures for breach of Act No.  concerning national security, and for disrupting national activities. On  October the examining magistrate ordered the preventive arrest of these persons, pending the completion of his investigation.
.As regards the allegations of threats to the life of Manuel Bustos by unidentified persons, the Government's communication reports that Mr. Bustos has stated that he has received threats against his physical integrity through recordings transmitted by telephone to his home, and through unsigned letters and leaflets; in this connection, he filed a request for protection on  October, which was granted by the First Chamber of the Court of Appeals of Santiago; the Court also provided for uniformed police to ensure round-the-clock protection at his home, place of employment and trade union office, for a period of  days. Following his preventive detention, Mr. Bustos's attorneys presented a second request for protection in connection with threats Mr. Bustos allegedly received while in gaol, and requested that he be transferred from the prison in which he was housed, to another known as ""anexo Capuchinos"", which has more ammenities and would supposedly provide greater security. The appeal was rejected on  October, on the grounds that it was contrary to law. In its communication the Government states that it will send information concerning the investigations as these are released by the judge, since according to the Code of Criminal Procedures, the investigation phase is subject to secrecy. The Government adds that it sought to protect the safety of the above-mentioned trade union leaders by transferring them to the ""annexo Capuchinos"" on  November, in accordance with the request presented by their attorneys.
.In another communication of  November , the Government reiterates the statements made by its representative on  November  before the th Session of the Governing Body, to the effect that the examining magistrate in the judicial proceedings granted release on bail to Manuel Bustos, Moiss Labraa and Arturo Martnez, leaders of the National Grouping of Workers.
.As regards the proceedings against Arturo Martnez, Moiss Labraa and Manuel Bustos for breach of section , paragraph  of Act No.  of  on national security, the Government, in its communication of  January , adds that the examining judge provisionally released these persons on  November , as reported in previous communications; it further states that the case is in plenary proceedings, and that the defendants have been notified of the charges formulated by the examining judge. The communication adds that the persons under indictment are duly counselled and represented by qualified and experienced attorneys, and that new information, as it arises, will be forwarded to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.In its communication of  November , the Government refers to a complaint presented by the National Confederation of Trade Unions, Federations and Associations of Chilean Workers in the Private Sector (CEPCH) concerning the provisions of Act No.  on the organisation of political parties, pursuant to which elected trade union leaders must sign an affidavit concerning their affiliation, if any, to political parties. In this connection, the Government states that the purpose of this affidavit is to enable the Electoral Services Office to instruct the political party concerned to rescind the elected trade union official's affiliation in the party; the purpose is not to prevent the trade union leader from having a doctrinary opinion concerning the Government's policies, but to enable him to devote all of his energies to trade union activities and the interests of the workers he represents. The Act is also intended to prevent political parties from using trade unions to reach their own",-1,1984,Chile
198,"objectives, without allowing the members and supporters of trade unions to disagree with party doctrine. Simultaneous roles as trade union leader and political militant would deprive the trade union movement of the independence it needs to act in defense of the legitimate economic and occupational interests of its members. In any event, according to the Government, it must be recalled that the trade union leader may in all freedom maintain, conserve and exercise all political rights, except for membership in a political party while he holds trade union office. Lastly, the communication notes that, without prejudice to what is stated concerning this aspect of the complaint, the national Government felt it necessary to issue a written statement to the Labour Administration as regards the question of maintaining the requirements concerning affiliation in political parties; on  October  it instructed the Labour Administration to eliminate this requirement.
.As regards the allegations presented by the National Confederation of Textile and Allied Workers' Federations and Trade Unions of Chile (CONTEXTIL) concerning the problems encountered by the workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise, the Government's communication of  November  states that the workers of the ""Sociedad Comercial e Industrial Colloky, Ltda."" enterprise, organised for the purpose of bargaining, presented to management a draft collective agreement dated  June . The workers appointed as negotiators began to enjoy time off and protection against dismissal five days prior to the date on which the draft was submitted. On  July  the enterprise replied to the draft presented by the workers, and sent a copy of the reply to the respective Labour Inspectorate. The workers' Bargaining Committee objected to the employer's observations to the Labour Inspectorate. Ultimately, the parties failed to reach an agreement, and it was thus that on Friday,  July , and in the presence of labour inspectors acting as witnesses, the workers' union voted in the majority to strike, informing the enterprise that the strike would begin on Monday,  August , at . hours. Pursuant to the terms of section  of the Labour Code, strikes which have been called must begin on the third working day following the decision to strike. In accordance with this legal provision, the trade union should have called the strike for Tuesday,  August . However, the workers illegally decided to go on strike one day prior to the time established by law, leaving their jobs suddenly, unjustifiably and without the enterprise's permission, since the working day ends at . hours. As a result of this sudden walk-out, the enterprise suffered serious economic losses.
.The Government's communication adds that on Monday,  August , the enterprise requested that a notary public personally certify that the workers had walked off the job. In a note dated  August , the enterprise informed the Labour Inspectorate that the workers had left their posts prior to the end of the working day, thus exposing themselves to a termination of the employment contract pursuant to the terms of section , clause  of the Labour Code, which provides that the contract of employment shall be terminated when: ""workers abandon their posts, which is understood to mean: the sudden and unjustified abandonment by the worker of the worksite during working hours, without the permission of the employer or his agent"". On  August , the enterprise requested before the Fourth Labour Court of Santiago that the workers who had abandoned their posts suddenly and without justification be deprived of their labour rights; on  October , following a more careful study of the situation, and following the Court's recommendations for conciliation, the enterprise reached an agreement with its workers, thus putting an end to the legal proceedings. The employer reinstated three workers and agreed to pay them back-pay. Subsequently,  workers counselled by their attorney, reached an agreement with the enterprise concerning the termination of their employment, an end to the judicial proceedings, and the payment of the indemnities and allowances specified in the judicial settlement. The Government has no further information to communicate in this matter.
.The Government sent a communication dated  January  in which it states that it has authorised trade union leader and ORIT official Luis Meneses Aranda to return to the country.
.In another communication dated  January , the Government furnishes additional observations concerning some of the allegations in this case, and in particular, in connection with the legal proceedings against Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing, which have been before the Court of First Instance since  June ; her attorney requested her release on bail, which was granted by the Public Prosecutor of Valdivia, and subsequently upheld by the Collegial Court of Santiago. Mrs. Brikmann was released on  September  and requested authorisation to leave the country and travel to the Federal Republic of Germany where she is currently residing. The Government states that it is unaware of any trade union office which Mrs. Brikmann may have held, or for that matter, of any involvement whatsoever in trade union matters.
.As regards the alleged threats to the lives of trade union leaders of the AGECH, of the Fifth District Teachers' College, of the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar, and of the Workers in Commerce Trade Union, of  February , concerning Jos Luis Muoz, Andrs Reyes, Hugo Guzmn, Mara Isabel Torres, Sergio Narvez and Florencio Valenzuela, the Government states that these threats were allegedly made by means of telephone calls, and that official investigations have not succeeded in identifying the persons responsible or establishing the extent to which they pose a real danger. The Government's communication adds that it is very difficult to identify persons who make accusations or threats anonymously by telephone or from a public telephone; it further notes that Chilean legislation establishes a special judicial recourse, the so-called ""Request for Protection""; when the seriousness and authenticity of the facts are proven, the Court of Appeals orders police protection for a specified period.
.As regards the ICFTU communication of  March  concerning allegations that police forces intervened in a national mobilisation of workers convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) on  March , in which several leaders of that organisation were wounded or detained, the Government's communication states that Rodolfo Seguel and Manuel Rodrguez were detained for one hour by uniformed police for attempting to prevent the free flow of traffic; they were immediately released and were not summoned by the court. Manuel Bustos was not detained, and there are no records that Luis Surez was arrested by uniformed police. The communication adds that this case concerns simple skirmishes with the police in downtown Santiago, in which the police sought to counter the above-mentioned efforts to tie up traffic. It is not true that there was a national mobilisation as alleged by the complainants, nor that persons were injured as a result.
.The Government's communication of  January  refers also to the IFPAAW complaint regarding Eugenio Len Gajardo's ineligibility to hold trade union office in the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants (CNC). The Government states that the Labour Office issued resolution No.  on  August , declaring Mr. Len Gajardo ineligible to hold office in the CNC on the grounds that he was not legally qualified to hold trade union office. On the basis of new information received in this matter, the Labour Office issued resolution No.  on  November  which rescinded resolution No.  and left Mr. Len Gajardo free to hold office in the CNC. He is currently presiding over this trade union organisation and carrying out his trade union activities in absolute freedom.
.As regards the ICFTU complaint contained in a communication of  November  concerning the refusal to renew passports and to allow Luis Meneses and Carmen Pinto to enter the country, the Government's communication confirming a previous communication of  January  indicates that official circular No.  of  December , issued by the Department of the Interior, authorised Luis Meneses to enter the country definitively and permanently; consequently, Mr. Meneses may enter the country whenever he wishes to do so since restrictions in this connection have been lifted. As regards the situation of Carmen Pinto, the Government's communication states that official circular No. , dated  July , of the Department of the Interior authorised her to enter the country definitively. The communication reports that the International Police Department reported that Carmen Pinto entered Chile on  July , under Chilean passport number  in her name, issued by the Consulate of Chile in France, and that she left the country with the same passport on  September . As regards the allegation that the Chilean embassy in France refused to renew her passport on  November , the staff of the Consulate General of Chile in Paris have reported that they have no records that this person requested an appointment on the date indicated in the ICFTU communication. Nevertheless, the Government's communication goes on to say that instructions have",0,1984,Chile
199,"been issued to the effect that should Mrs. Carmen Pinto again visit the Chilean Consulate General in Paris, she be personally attended by the Consul and any misunderstandings clarified. Lastly, it should be recalled once more that the prohibitions which barred these persons from entering the country were in no way related to trade union activities which they may have carried out in the past in Chile. Moreover, the Government rejects the false charges that it is adopting ""new methods of repression against Chilean trade union leaders"". The Government's communication states that by granting entry to the country and terminating exile, it shows its intention to return as soon as possible to the broadest institutional normalcy, so that all Chileans may choose their own destiny, in peace and free from foreign interference.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that Luis Meneses Aranda, if he has not acquired another nationality, must request travel documents from the government of the country where he is residing. The Chilean consular authorities have been instructed to grant him a temporary visa for  days so that he may visit the country and personally handle his temporary or permanent residence, whichever is the case, and regularise his situation.
.In a further communication of  February , the Government states that Messrs. Bustos, Martinez and Labraa have been released and have brought an appeal to modify the sentences handed down against them. The appeal will be heard by a higher court during the last week of February .
.The allegations which remained pending following the most recent examination of the case in November , concerned the trial of Beatriz Brikmann; the threats to the lives of trade union leaders of the AGECH, the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar, and of the Workers in Commerce Trade Union; the intervention by police forces in a national mobilisation of workers convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) which led to the injury and arrest of leaders of that organisation; the difficulties encountered by workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise in signing a collective agreement and the enterprise's refusal to recognise the workers' representatives; the legal provisions which make the holding of trade union office incompatible with affiliation in a political party; the ineligibility of the president of the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants (CNC) to hold the office to which he was elected; the assault and arrest at the hands of security forces of dozens of workers and trade unionists during a national day of protest called by the CNT in October , and continued threats against the lives of CNT president, Manuel Bustos, as well as the judicial summons of CNT leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa and their subsequent imprisonment. Since then, the Committee has received new allegations concerning the authorities' refusal to renew the passport of Carmen Pinto, and the situation of trade unionist Luis Meneses, who was stripped of his Chilean citizenship and has been authorised to enter the country only on a temporary basis, and the sentence handed down as regards CNT trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa.
.As regards the WCOTP complaints concerning telephone threats to the lives of trade union leaders of the Teachers' College of Chile in Valparaiso, the AGECH, the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar, and the Workers in Commerce Trade Union, as well as the complaints filed by the CNT and the ICFTU concerning continued threats to the lives of trade union leader Manuel Bustos, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government concerning the corresponding investigations and the request for protection provided for by legislation when the authenticity and seriousness of the threat is demonstrated; in view of the numerous allegations of this nature which have been received since this case was opened, the Committee wishes to point out that a trade union movement in which trade union leaders are able to represent fully the interests of workers, in freedom and independence, cannot develop where trade unionists are threatened and live in fear; it urges the Government to undertake judicial investigations with a view to putting an end to these acts of intimidation which sow uncertainty in trade union ranks.
.As regards the death of Jos Carrasco Tapia, a trade union leader of the Metropolitan Journalists' Council, and the attempted murder of Juan Espinoza, a national trade union leader of the Confederation of Maritime Workers (CONGEMAR) and his family, the Committee notes that in the case of Mr. Carrasco Tapia the Government states that the matter is being investigated, although the guilty parties have not yet been identified; and that in the case of Mr. Espinoza and his family, no charges were filed in connection with the attempted arson of his home, while he and his family slept; the Committee recalls that murder and other violent acts affecting trade unionists are serious matters which require the authorities to adopt severe measures with a view to re-establishing a normal situation.
.As regards the various complaints concerning the arrest of trade unionists, presented by the CUT, ICFTU, WFTU and CNT, concerning trade union leaders Rodolfo Seguel (CNT), Manuel Rodrguez, Jorge Pavez (AGECH) and Guillermo Azula (AGECH), of  March , for having participated in a peaceful demonstration to demand the reinstatement of , teachers dismissed during the course of , the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that these persons were arrested for obstructing the passage of vehicles and persons on a public thoroughfare, and that they were released following a summons by the Local Police Court, a court which imposes small fines for traffic violations, with the exception of Mr. Azula, in regards to whom there are no records of arrest and who is currently at liberty. As regards the arrest of a number of miners and their confinement in the Santiago Penitentiary for participating in days of protest in support of the right to work, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that, with the exception of Domingo Alvial Mundaca, who is on trial for the illegal possession of explosives and detonators and for engaging in terrorist acts, the other miners mentioned by the complainant organisation are not currently under arrest. As regards the detention of former CUT trade union leaders Luis Guzmn and Mireya Baltra, who are allegedly being detained illegally in the Santiago Penitentiary, as well as that of Sergio Luis Lazo, who is alleged to have subsequently disappeared, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that Luis Guzmn is being tried for the crimes specified in the Act on the control of arms and explosives, for forgery of public instruments, and for entering the country illegally, and is not being detained illegally, but that his confinement has been ordered by the courts; likewise, the Committee takes note of the fact that Sergio Luiz Lazo was authorised to enter the country on  June , and that he has not been, and is not currently being, detained; and that Mireya Baltra is in the country and enjoys complete freedom.
.As regards the complaint of several trade union organisations concerning the arrest and subsequent imprisonment of trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, on charges of incitement to strike and paralyse trade, production, and public services on  October , the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government concerning the proceedings against the above-mentioned trade union leaders. The Committee expresses its concern that Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez have been sentenced to  days' imprisonment, and Moiss Labraa to  days' imprisonment for breach of the State Security Act, and wishes to emphasise that the arrest and sentencing of workers' representatives for activities related to the defence of workers' interests are contrary to the principle of free exercise of trade union rights. It notes in this connection that Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa are free and have appealed against these sentences.
.The Committee must also express its concern with respect to the continuing numerous complaints received since this case was opened, in connection with the arrest and/or imprisonment of trade unionists, although it wishes to state that it has taken note of the fact that certain arrests for which complaints have been field (in particular, the arrest of Luis Guzmn and Domingo Alvial Mundaca) fall beyond the scope of the freedom of association and, therefore, the competence of this Committee. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that although trade union responsibilities do not confer the right to transgress legal provisions with impunity, such legal provisions should not undermine basic guarantees as regards freedom of association, nor sanction activities which, in accordance with generally accepted principles, should be considered as legitimate trade union activities.
.As regards the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers' Trade Union, and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez",-1,1984,Chile
200,"on  May , the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that there is no record or knowledge of these alleged illegal searches, and that in any event, they were not ordered by government authorities.
.As regards the refusal to allow Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro to enter the country, the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the names of these persons appear on a list of persons who are not authorised to enter the country, but that the Government is currently reviewing the situation of all persons affected by this prohibition, with a view to lifting this restriction.
.As regards the ICFTU communication of  November  concerning the refusal to renew the passport of Carmen Pinto and to allow access to the country to trade unionist Luis Meneses Aranda, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that there is no record that Mrs. Pinto ever requested the renewal of her passport on the date indicated in the ICFTU communication, at the Consulate General of Chile in Paris, and that the Government has issued instructions that, should Carmen Pinto again visit the Chilean Consulate General in Paris, she be personally attended by the Consul and any misunderstandings clarified. As regards the case of Luis Meneses Aranda, the Committee takes note of the fact that official circular No.  of  December  authorises him to enter the country on a -day visa so as to be able to personally deal with the question of his temporary or permanent residence and to regularise his situation. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall the principle that the confinement or exile of trade unionists, even when based on a state of national crisis, should be provided with the necessary safeguards to prevent that these measures be used to curtail the free exercise of trade union rights.
.As regards the complaint presented by the CEPCH concerning legal provisions which establish and regulate the incompatibility between trade union office and affiliation in a political party, and the requirement that elected trade union leaders sign an affidavit concerning any political affiliation, the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that such provisions are designed to prevent the same person from holding simultaneous roles as a trade union leader and militant in a political party, a condition which would deprive the trade union movement of the independence it needs to act in the defence of the interests of workers, and that in any event, trade union leaders maintain and may exercise all of their political rights; likewise, the Committee notes that the requirement that elected trade union officials sign an affidavit concerning their affiliation, if any, in a political party, was rescinded by the Government on  October . Nevertheless, the Committee wishes to recall the principle that legislation which prohibits certain persons from holding trade union office on the basis of political opinions or affiliations is contrary to the right of trade unionists to elect their representatives in full freedom (see nd Report, Case No.  (Malaysia), para. ).
.As regards the IFPAAW communication concerning Eugenio Len Gajardo's ineligibility to hold office in the CNC, the Committee notes that his ineligibility has been rescinded following the examination of new evidence, by means of resolution No.  of  November , and that Mr. Len Gajardo is currently presiding over the CNC, the office to which he was elected.
.As regards the allegations presented by the National Confederation of Textile and Allied Workers' Federations and Trade Unions of Chile (CONTEXTIL) concerning the problems encountered by the workers of the Baby Colloky enterprise in signing a collective agreement, and certain unfair labour practices carried out by the enterprise, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise went on strike one day before the expiration of the period specified by legislation, which caused the enterprise economic hardship and constituted grounds for the termination of employment contracts. The Committee notes that on  November  the enterprise reached a settlement in court with the workers, and in accordance with conciliation guide-lines laid down by the court in an effort to resolve the matter, the enterprise reinstated three workers with back-pay, and terminated the employment contracts of  workers by mutual agreement, upon payment of the indemnities established by the court.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) Once again, the Committee expresses its concern over the continuing number of complaints presented since this case was opened, which reflects the difficulties encountered by the trade union movement and its leaders.b) As regards the dispute involving workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise, in view of the fact that the parties have reached an agreement in keeping with the conciliation guide-lines set down by the court, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.c) As regards Eduardo Len Gajardo's disqualification from holding the office to which he was elected by the CNC, and his subsequent qualification, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.d) In the light of the number of complaints concerning threats to the lives of trade unionists, the Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial investigations with a view to determining once and for all who is responsible for these threats, and to determine the seriousness of the threats and intention of the parties involved in each case, and to provide the necessary protection as soon as these threats are reported, with a view to ensuring that trade union activities may take place normally in a climate free of fear and intimidation.e) As regards the death of Jos Carrasco Tapia, trade union leader of the Metropolitan Journalists' Council, the Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the judicial investigations in this case; as regards the attempt to burn alive Mr. Espinoza, trade union leader of CONGEMAR, and his family, the Committee urges the Government to take appropriate measures to punish the authors of these alleged violent acts, which breed fear and uncertainty throughout the labour movement.f) As regards the many allegations concerning the detention of trade unionists and, in particular the detention of Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, the Committee expresses its great concern at the sentencing of these three CNT trade union leaders, and requests the Government to supply information on the legal situation, and in particular on the outcome of the appeal filed by these trade unionists.g) In connection with the various allegations that trade unionists have been prevented from entering the country, the Committee urges the Government to rescind, as soon as possible, the bans against Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, Hernn del Canto Riquelme and Mario Navarro and to inform it in this regard; it also requests the Government to keep it informed of the situation of Mr. Meneses Aranda, particularly as regards the restoration of his Chilean nationality.h) As regards the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers' Trade Unions and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez, the Committee urges the Government to undertake investigations with a view to identifying the persons responsible for these actions and to inform the Committee of the results of these inquiries.i) As regards legal provisions which establish incompatibility between trade union office and affiliation in a political party, the Committee requests the Government to amend the legislation to bring it into line with general principles of freedom of association and, in particular, to repeal those legislative provisions which restrict the workers' right to elect their representatives freely by making the holding of trade union office incompatible with membership in a political party.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions, most recently at its February  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see the th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )).
.Subsequently, the ILO received the following communications from the complainants: Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH):  February ; World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  February and  April ; International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  and  March,  April, ,  and  October ; National Confederation of Trade Unions of Leather and Shoe Workers (ex FONACC):  April ; Unity Confederation of Chilean Workers (CUT):  June ; the National Confederation of Textile and Allied Workers' Federations and Trade Unions of Chile (CONTEXTIL):  August ; the National Confederation of Trade Unions, Federations and Associations of Chilean Workers in the Private Sector (CEPCH): August ; International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers:  September . The Government transmitted observations in communications of  February,  May",-1,1984,Chile
201,"and  September . Shortly before its meeting, the Committee received observations from the Government dated  October  and concerning the CUT's allegations, which will be examined at its next meeting in February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) northe Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.During the most recent examination of the case, several allegations presented by the WCOTP, the ICFTU and several national confederations remained pending.
.In a joint communication, several Chilean national confederations reported that unidentified persons had visited the homes of Manuel Caro Castro and Enrique Avendao Atenas, leaders of the Catering Confederation and the El Sucro Peasants' Confederation, respectively.
.The WCOTP alleged that Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing had been detained since  September , and reffered to the adoption by the Ministry of the Interior of Decree (No. ) of  May  concerning the reduction of the number of teachers in municipal schools, which the WCOTP alleges was used as a pretext to dismiss well-qualified teachers because of their trade union activities.
.In support of these allegations, the WCOTP supplied a list of  leaders of the Professional Association of Teachers' Colleges of Chile (AGECH) and  leaders of the Teachers' College of Chile who were dismissed. It also supplied the breakdown, by province, of the number of dismissed teachers, which had then reached ,.
.For its part, the ICFTU attached to its communication a report prepared by the Centre for Trade Union Research and Assistance concerning events which took place during the celebration of Labour Day in Santiago on  May  and, in particular, on the illegal search of the premises of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH), and of the homes of several national trade union leaders. . At its March  Session, the Governing Body approved, among others, the following recommendations of the Committee: (a) the Committee requests the Government to supply more detailed information on the charges brought against Mrs. Beatriz Brikmann Scheiling;(b) the Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the search of the premises of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers and of the homes of several national trade union leaders, as well as on the dismissals allegedly carried out for trade union activities in the teaching sector.
.In a communication of  February , the AGECH supplies a list of  AGECH leaders and  leaders of the Teachers' College of Chile who had been dismissed prior to  February, as well as a report on the geographical distribution of dismissed teachers, whose number has now reached '.
.In its communication of  February , the WCOTP reports that on  February , Luis Muoz, a trade union leader of the Teachers' College of Chile in Valparaiso, received an anonymous telephone call informing him that unless he and Andrs Reyes of the AGECH, Hugo Guzmn, leader of the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar, Maria Isabel Torres, leader of the Fifth District Teachers' College, Sergio Narvez and Florencio Valenzuela, president of the Workers in Commerce Trade Union, left the country before the month of March, action would be taken against them and their families; he interpreted this as a threat to their lives.
.In a communication of  April , the WCOTP sends two new lists of teachers' trade union leaders who were dismissed under the Ministry of the Interior's Official Letter No.  of  May ; the first list contains the names of  leaders of the Teachers' College, and the second the names of  leaders of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH). Both lists refer to the situation as at  March .
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions (IFFTU) and the Teachers' College of Chile state in a communication of  March  that in  the Govenment had undertaken an administrative reform of the Chilean educational system with the aim of transferring responsibility for and control over educational institutions from the Ministry of Education to the municipalities. This has resulted in a drastic change in the labour situation of Chilean teachers, and has been accompanied, in particular, by amendments to labour legislation which have the effect of subjecting teachers to market forces, to the detriment of previously won guarantees, stability and benefits. These measures are designed to reduce and fragment the Chilean teaching profession, as evidenced by the fact that more than  per cent of the dismissed teachers are accredited teachers with vast experience, many of whom held local trade union office in the Teachers' College; clearly, the intent is to limit the organisational capacity of the trade union.
.In its communication of  March , the ICFTU alleges that on  March  a peaceful national mobilisation of workers, convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) to request an increase in wages, an end to the privitisation of nationalised enterprises, and respect of human and trade union rights, was violently broken up by police forces; among the injured were Manuel Bustos, Vice-President of the CNT, and Rodolfo Seguel, President of the CNT, who was later arrested along with Manuel Rodrguez and Lus Surez, leaders of the same organisation.
.In its communication of  April , the ICFTU sends additional information alleging the arrest of three leaders of the Teachers' College: Osvaldo Verdugo, Lus Cisternas and Pedro Soto, along with nine professors of the Santiago Centre, following a peaceful demonstration organised by the teachers on  February  in front of the Ministry of Education to protest the massive dismissals.
.The ICFTU attaches to its communication a list of  leaders of the Teachers' College who have been dismissed, as well as a statistical table comparing the information furnished by the Ministry of Education and that furnished by the Teachers' College with respect to the number of teachers dismissed nationally, and a document containing critical observations and proposals in connection with the Ministry of the Interior's Official Letter No.  of  May  on the measures to be taken by municipalities with a view to reducing budgetary deficits in the educational sector.
.In its communication of  April , the National Confederation of trade Unions of Leather and Shoe Workers (ex FONACC) alleges that the promulgation of Legislative Decree No.  of  on collective bargaining revoked a national collective agreement which had regulated labour relations among workers and employers in the leather and footwear industry for  years, thereby threatening to dispossess by administrative authority the workers of their rightful property.
.The communication reports that since , employers have been under the obligation to contribute a sum equal to  per cent of their wage bill to an Occupational Benefit Fund, which had been administered exclusively by the workers since . In  the Fund purchased a construction and leasing enterprise (SOCORE), with a view to relieving the housing problems of leather and shoe workers. The workers are the only shareholders in this enterprise, which is managed by persons elected by the shareholders for this purpose. Sections  to  of Act No. , promulgated on  August , called for the dismantling of the Benefit Fund and appointed the Directorate of Social Security as liquidator; they further provided that the  per cent contribution which had theretofore been made to the Fund should be used to increase the wages of workers. As at the date of the Fund's liquidation ( August ), the employers owed contributions in the amount of  million pesos (U$,), plus re-adjustments and interest. The communication states that these monies belong to the workers. The communication adds that, as at that date, neither the liquidation nor the wage increase had been carried out, because the Directorate of Social Security claimed that it was unable to liquidate the Fund while it did not have a control of the SOCORE enterprise which, it contends, belongs to the Fund. The workers have repeatedly stated that the SOCORE enterprise and the Fund are two separate entities and are thus governed by the different laws.
.The communication of the National Confederation adds that upon the termination of the national collective agreement and of the Benefit Fund, the enterprise will be forced into liquidation owing to a lack of revenue. The liquidation was approved at a special meeting, which appointed a liquidating committee which has already undertaken the corresponding measures. This decision of the directors of the enterprise (who are also directors of the Confederation) to go into liquidation was declared null and void on  October  by the Securities and Exchange Commission - the body which currently controls the enterprise; its ruling was appealed by the enterprise's directors who requested the Court of Appeals to issue a restraining order, but none has yet been handed down.
.The National Confederation concludes by stating that if the Directorate of Social Security succeeds in gaining control over the SOCORE enterprise, it would take possession of the property of the National Confederation; while",0,1984,Chile
202,"the proceeds of the liquidation would be turned over the workers, the liquidation would effectively destroy the trade union organisation of workers in this sector.
.In its communication of  June , the Unity Confederation of Chilean Workers (CUT) furnishes new information concerning the complaints presented by the ICFTU, WCL, WFTU, IFFTU and WCOTP.
.The CUT alleges the infringement of certain trade union rights and reports the following events: - the murder of Jos Carrasco Tapia, a trade union leader of the Metropolitan Journalists' Council of  September , as evidence by the action for relief filed on  September  before the Court of Appeals of Santiago (Complaint No. -);- the arrest and ill-treatment of the President of the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), Rodolfo Seguel, of Jorge Pavez, President of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH), and of Guillermo Azula, national leader of the AGECH, on  March , during a peaceful demonstration for the reinstatement of , teachers dismissed in ; - the imprisonment in the Santiago Penitentiary of the following miners: Domingo Alvial Mondaca, Adrin Cabrera R., Jos Delgado Z., Pedro Lobos P., Dagoberto Lpez R., Ricardo Mondaca G., Mario Santibez, Emilio Vargas M., Ral Vsquez I., Domingo Araza C., Armando Irrazbal C., Sergio Jeria I., Jean Jorquera I., Erasmo Mayolinca Ch., Marcos Sala B., Leonardo Torres G., and Yuri Vargas A., for participating in protest days calling for the respect of labour rights rights and denouncing tragic accidents in coal mines;- appeals for relief filed bz the leaders of the Federation of Trade Unions of Self-employed and Temporary Workers before the Court of Appeals on  July , to denounce the assault against Angel Arriagada Arriagada, a leader of the Federation, on  April , and the search of the trade union office and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivarez Prez, on  May ;- the attempted homicide of Juan Espinoza, a national trade union leader of the Confederation of Maritime Workers (CONGEMAR), when his house was set on fire while he and his family were sleeping, in January ;- refusal to allow entry to the country to several CUT trade union leaders, and the arrest of former trade union leaders Luis Guzmn, who is being illegally detained at the Santiago Penitentiary for having entered the country without the Government's prior authorisation in early , and Mireya Baltra, a former national trade union leader of the CUT, who was illegally arrested in Puerto Aysn for having entered the country on  May ; the arrest and disappearance of Sergio Ruiz Lazo, a former textile trade union leader, after having entered Chile in . The Government also continues to refuse entry to the country of many trade-unionists including: Rolando Cadern Aranquiz, former Secretary-General of CUT, and Hernn del Canto Riguelme, Luis Meneses Aranda, Mario Navarro Castro, Bernardo Vargas Fernandez, all former CUT national leaders.
.The CUT concludes its communication by denouncing the massive dismissal of , primary and secondary school and university teachers including  national and regional trade union leaders of the AGECH, and  national and regional leaders of the Teachers' College , alleging that the Government plans to raise the number of dismissed teachers to , during the course of this year.
.In a communication of  August  the National Confederation of Federations and Trade Unions of Chilean Textile and Allied Workers (CONTEXTIL) describes the situation of workers at the Baby Colloky enterprise who, having endeavoured unsuccesfully for  years to resolve with management their wage, labour and social problems, decided on  June  to incorporate all their claims in a collective agreement. The enterprise rejected all these requests, declaring them illegal, and refused to engage in discussions with, or to recognise, the workers' representatives who comprised the Bargaining Committee, in violation of Section  of the Labour Code. The communication also states that the mamagement of the Baby Colloky enterprise began to transfer machinery and personnel from another of its plants in order to replace workers' who wer legally on strike. Lastly, the communication from CONTEXTIL adds that supporting documentation setting out these facts was sent to the Labour Inspectorate and to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, but that no reply had been received as the strike entered its th day.
.In its communication of August  the National Confederation of Trade Unions, Federations and Associations of Chilean Workers in the Private Sector (CEPCH) denounces a situation which it claims arises from certain legal provisions enacted by the Chilean Government which, in its opinion, are contrary to the principles of Freedom of Association. The CEPCH states that it held its Fourth National Congress in June of this year; in accordance with the Confederation's by-laws, it proceeded to elect the  members of its National Board and appointed those candidates who received the greatest number of votes. The election was carried out democratically, and was supervised by a representative of the labour authorities, acting in an official capacity. Following the election, the newly elected trade union leaders were summoned to appear before the Provincial Labour Office of Santiago for the purpose of signing an affidavit concerning their political affiliations, if any. The elected trade union leaders initially refused to comply with this requirement, but finally aquiesced. The communication adds that this requirement arises from a number of provisions in Chilean Legislation which make the holding of trade union office incompatible with membership in a political party. These provisions are the following:
.Constitution of Article , paragraph : ""Trade unions and their officials shall not participate in party politics.""Article , paragraph : ""The holding of office in a trade union shall be incompatible with militancy in a political party.""Article : ""The following persons are barred as candidates for office as congressmen or senators: (item ): Persons holding a trade union or similar office. (Last item): The provisions of this article shall apply to persons who have held any of the above-mentioned offices within a two-year period preceding the election; candidates who are not elected shall not return to the same previous office, nor be appointed to similar offices for a period of two years following the election.""
.Act No.  concerning political partiesSection : ""Membership in political parties is restricted to citizens registered on voting lists. Nevertheless, trade union officials are not eligible for membership in political parties.""""Persons affiliated with a political party who join any of the institutions mentioned in the preceding paragraph, or who become trade union officials shall immediately relinquish their affiliation with such political party.""""In the cases mentioned abvove, persons assuming a trade union office shall sign an affidavit concerning any possible affiliation with a political party.""""Persons making false statements under oath shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Penal Code.""
.Section  of the Penal Code""Persons guilty of making false statements under oath before the public authorities or their agents in non-litigious matters shall be sentenced to terms of imprisonment and fined in amounts ranging from , to , pesos."" Such terms of imprisonment shall range from  days to three years.
.The Labour CodeSection : ""Persons holding trade union office: (No.:) Must comply with eligibility and other requirements established by the Constitution or legislation.""Section , paragraph : ""A trade union official-elect who does not meet the requirements for trade union office shall be replaced by the person receiving the next highest number of votes, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraph.""The CEPCH communication adds that these legal texts clearly reflect the Government's decision to make the holding of trade union office incompatible with the full exercise of civil rights, and that the compulsory and incompatibility of trade union activity with affiliation in a political party, as established in the final paragraph of article  of the Constitution, infringes the fundamental rights of workers and of all citizens in a democratic system. According to the complainant, this situation weakens the trade union movement and intimidates its members; it deprives the worker of public and political power and inhibits his right to express opinions and formulate labour demands, since these can be considered as political opinions. The CEPCH communication concludes by stating that the new Labour Code, which entered into force on th August , reproduces verbatim the provisions contained in Legislative Decree No.  of  concerning the organisation of trade unions, and in particular section , which states that: ""Any worker who is a member of the relevant trade union and who fulfils the requirements laid down by this Legislative Decree for office as member of the board of management shall be eligible to stand as a candidate in elections the board""; The CEPCH argues that this represents a curtailment of freedom of association, since the workers cannot nominate their candidates in advance; moreover, if all members of a trade union are considered as candidates, the workers elected will not have been consulted previously. In these circumstances a member of the trade union elected with the greatest number of votes (an",-1,1984,Chile
203,"expression of the democratic will of the rank and file) may be declared ineligible for failing to sign an affidavit or for preferring to exercise in full his civil rights. Thus, this legal mechanism plainly undermines the decisions of the trade union's rank and file by disqualifying the elected official and replacing him with a worker who has received fewer votes. Lastly, the CEPCH adds that its efforts before the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and General Directorate of labour Services to remedy this situation have been unsuccesful.
.In its communication of  September , the IFPAAW alleges that Eugenio Eduardo Len Gajardo, President of the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants (CNC), was informed by the Provincial Labour Inspectorate of Santiago that he was not eligible to serve as President, despite his constitutional election at the most recent congress of the CNC, on the grounds that he had been arrested for participating in a mobilisation of workers which culminated in a strike on  and  July , and was subsequentlz charged with a crime under the National Security Act, which entails criminal sanctions and makes him ineligible to hold office in the CNC. The Provincial Labour Inspectorate therefore informed the trade union that it should appoint the person who received the next highest number of votes in the election. The FITPAS communication adds that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Len was participating in the above-mentioned mobilisation in his capacity as a trade union leader; for these reasons the CNC refuses to designate another person as its President.
.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU states that the Government arbitrarily refused to authorise a national day of protest called by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) for  October  to request the Government to comply with the economic claims of workers, and to put an end to the privatisation of enterprises. The ICFTU adds that approximately  persons who were participating in this day of protest were arrested, including several trade unionists, and that others suffered gunshot wounds at the hands of security forces. The communication concludes by expressing serious concern over the numerous threats to the lives of CNT leaders, and in particular its President, Manuel Bustos. In a further communication of  October , the ICFTU reports that the Government, acting through the Ministry of the Interior, filed charges before the courts against Messrs. Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labrana were questioned by a Judge of the Supreme Court on the order of the Ministry of the Interior and were imprisoned in the Santiago Penitentiary for having called the national work stoppage on  October.
.As regards the joint letter in which several national Chilean confederations reported that the homes of Manuel Caro Castro and Enrique Avendao Atenas, leaders of the Catering Confederation, and the El Surco Peasants' Confederation, respectively, had been visited by unidentified persons, the Government states that the police investigation of these allegations found that no complaints were lodged in this connection, and that there were no warrants for the arrest these trade union leaders, who continue to exercise their activities as usual; moreover, it has no information concerning the alleged search of the headquarters of these organisations.
.As regards the allegation made by several national and international trade unions concerning the massive dismissal of teachers, the Government states that due to a lack of planning dating back to the s, educational institutions trained more teachers than are needed in the s. Consequently, in recent years educational institutions have operated with a surplus of , teachers; moreover, if the current pace of training in the universities is maintained, by  the country will a surplus of , primary-school teachers and , secondary-school teachers. The government states that a shortage of accredited teachers in the 's led the schools to hire , persons who lacked teacher's training; when the Teachers' College of Chile was established, these persons were given a grace period of  years in which to secure proper accreditation, and were repeatedly reminded that they would no longer be able to teach after this period unless they became accredited. The Government adds that the surplus of teachers is exacerbated by the fact that a great number of teachers with more than  years of service have not retired, owing to poor retirement pensions. In order to correct these anomalies persons without accreditation have been barred from the teaching profession; they have been indemnified with one momth's wages for each year of service (with a ceiling of six years), even though current legislation does not require the payment of this indemnity. Moreover, retired teachers who have been rehired, as well as teachers with more than  years of service and teachers wity  years or more of service who are entitled to retirement have relieved of their duties. These measures have also affected accredited teachers whose performance is considered substandard. Thus, the dismissal off teachers is not in fact an abrupt measure, but one that was widely publicised beforehand among those concerned.
.In another communication the Government sends additionnal information concerning the dismissal of teachers to complement that which submitted on  March  to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations concerning the application of the Employment Policy Convention,  (No. ). In this communication the Government states that Official Letter No.  of  May  of the Ministry of the Interior, alleged by several complainant organisations to have ordered the dismissal of up to , teachers in Chile, does not contain a reference to any such number of teachers. The Letter discusses the need to take lawful measures in order to place accredited teachers who have not found work within the school system because many positions are held by teachers who have been practising without credentials and teachers who have not filed for retirement in spite of their long years of service. These circumstances have made it difficult for aspiring teachers with five years of studies to find work within the educational system. The Government's communication also states that, in recognition of the teachers' contributions to the country's social development, the Teacher's College of Chile was created on  October  by means of Legislative Decree No. . At the same time the Ministry of Education issued regulations concerning the exercise of the teaching profession (Supreme Decree No. /), as amended by Supreme Decrees Nos. / and / . Legislative Decree No.  was issued in response to the aspirations of Chilean teachers for the creation of this College; transitory section  (No.  ) of the Decree established a term of eight years in which persons who had been teaching without appropriate credentials for more than five but for less than ten years should become accredited or pass a special course for their regularisation. Subsequently, this term was extended to  September . Thus, non-accredited teachers have had a term of twelve years in which to regularise their situation. Nevertheless, in an effort to avoid undue prejudice they were allowed to finish the school year into benefit from accumulated leave entitlements even after the expiration of the above- mentionned term. Likewise, the Official Letter of the Ministry of the Interior to which the WCOTP had referred, instructed municipalities to retain those teachers who, in their opinion, had rendered distinguished service in their respective educational systems, as well as those who had worked in remote areas, with the sacrifice than this entailed. This goes to show that the measure in question is not inflexible and it takes into account the work performed by these persons, notwithstanding the claims of certain trade unions. A teachers' census carried out by the Ministry of Education in  showed that the number of non-accredited teachers was in order of ,. On the basis of recent information, it is estimated that approximately , of these managed to regularise their situation. Of the remainder, approximately , work within the state educational system, and , in subsidised private education. Consequently, the measure in question is affecting approximately , persons, who have had  years to regularise their situation but not have done so. This number is expected to be reduced further by the provisions for flexibility outlined above. However, it should be noted that these persons occupy posts that could be assigned to accredited teachers, which would allow the country to use in full  per cent of accredited teachers. This is a figure which is not matched even in many developed countries. The other situation concerns approximately , teachers who have been dismissed pursuant to an administrative ordinance (Order No. /, selection , clause f) which calls for the retirement of employees aged  or over, or with more than  years of service. Although strictly speaking the ordinance applies only to teachers in state-owned schools, it has been extended to teachers in municipal schools with a view to promoting the integration of accredited teachers. The remaining , teachers were dismissed owing",-1,1984,Chile
204,"in large measure to the merger and closing of outdated and run-down educational institutions, or to those with low registation near other establishments. This figure also reflects the over-endowment of certain establishments, in contrast to others where there are shortages of teachers. Thus, most of the teachers who find themselves in this situation will be absorbed by other educational institutions which have already announced competitions to fill vacancies. Consequently, the Government concludes, the provisions in question do not affect , teachers, as claimed by the trade union organisations; moreover, they have been applied in accordance with the legal provisions in force aimed at ensuring the employment of highly qualified and accredited teachers, whose occupational integration had been hindered by the retention of teachers who were not accredited or who sould have taken retirement. Likewise, certain measures have been taken to retain persons who are considered indispensable, either because of the quality of their work or in view of their long service in remote areas. The Government's communication also contains a report with statistical data which shows that the Chilean educational system has a surplus of teachers, rather than a deficit as stated in a publication of the Teachers' College.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing, the Government states that this persn is being tried (Complaint No. -) and charged under section  of Act No.  on arms control, which applies to those who ""organise, belong to, finance, abet, assist, instruct, incite or induce the creation and operations of private militia, combat groups of militariat parties ..."". Meetings were held in the home of Mrs. Brikmann for the purpose of planning an co-ordinating subversive actions, a fact that was acknowledged by Mrs. Brikmann herself to Mr. Horst Kriegler, the Consul of the Federal Republic of Germany in Concepcin, during a visit he paid her in September . The Government states that Mrs. Brikmann's attorneys filed an appeal for relief which was denied by the Court of Appeals on  September ; her release was requested on  December, but denied by the Court in accordance with section (c) of the Penal Procedures Code, which allows the judge to deny such a request when he considers that the applicant represents a threat to the security of society. In November , Mrs. Brikmann's attorneys filed an appeal against the public prosecutor in this case; the complaint was dismissed and the ruling subsequently appealed before the Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal and upheld the sentence on  January .
.As regards the inspections of the headquarters of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers, the Government states that the second Prosecutor's office is currently prosecuting a case for illegal search (Complaint No. /); since the proceedings are at the indictment stage, which is secret, additional information is not currently available.
.As regards the arrest of Osvaldo Verdugo, Luis Cisternas and Pedro Soto, three leaders of the Teachers' College, and that of nine other teachers, the Government states that on  February  a group of persons met before the Ministry of Education, impeding the free passage of vehicles and pedestrians. They were arrested by uniformed police for disturbing the peace; after their identities and addresses were verified, they were fined  pesos each and released pending a summons by the Third Police Court of Santiago. The other nine persons arrested that same day were released unconditionally shortly thereafter.
.As regards the communication of the National Confederation of Trade Unions of Leather and Shoe Workers, (ex-FONACC), the Government reports that the ""Sociedad Annima de Construccin y Renta, SOCORE, SA"" has over , shareholders; its major shareholders are the Foundation for the Social Development of the Leather and Shoe Industry which holds . per cent of outstanding shares, and the ex-Benefit Trade Union Fund for Leather and Shoe Workers, in liquidation, represented by the Directorate of Social Security, which owns . per cent of outstanding shares. The remaining shares are distributed among the office shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees limited liability companies, is responsible for verifying the compliance of enterprises with applicable statutory provisions and regulations, regardless of the identity of their shareholders. As regards the enterprise in question, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken several measures with view to ensuring compliance by its Board of Directors with Act No.  concerning enterprises. In fact, there have been numerous infractions which had led the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt such measures as the review of financial statements submitted to the the shareholders; the suspension of improperly convened shareholder meetings; the sanctioning of the Board of Directors for its persistent reluctance to comply with the law and with the instructions of the Commission. The Government's communication indicates that the Securities and Exchange Commission ""has not authorised the enterprise's liquidation"" since it is not comptent to ""authorise"" the liquidation of an enterprise, although it may prevent a liquidation carried out without compliance with the legal requirements. In the case of SOCORE, its its solution has not been approved by the genuine representatives of the shareholders, since the enterprise's Board of Directors has refused to recognise the Directorate of Social Security as the liquidator of the ex-Benefit Fund and the ex-Fund as lawful owner of a considerable percentage of the shares of the enterprise in question; this matter can only be clarified in a ordinary court of law.
.Concerning the judicial claims mentioned by the complainant, the Government's communication adds that all court decisions have gone against the SOCORE Board of Directors, and that none have challenged the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has only sought to ensure compliance with the law by the directors of this enterprise, without ever calling into question their presumed status as trade union leaders. As regards the role of the Directorate of Social Security in the dissolution of the Trade Union Benefit Fund for Leather and Shoe Workers, the Government's communication adds that this ""Fund"" was established in  pursuant to an arbitrator's award and was financed by the employers' monthly withholding of  per cent of the remuneration of all workers in this sector; it was designed to indemnify workers upon termination, and was not subject to any type of control. Transitory section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  July  required all external funds to obtain legal status within a term of six months, failing which they would be dissolved. Section , clause  of Legislative Decree No.  of  November  replaced the earlier text and granted a further period of six months for compliance with its requirements, and again called for the extinction and liquidation of funds failing to comply. Section  of Act No. , published on  August , set out to clarify the earlier instruments and provided that external funds which had not obtained legal status by  May  were to be considered dissolved, regardless of the stage of proceedings concerning their application for legal status. Section  of Act No.  ordered that funds thus dissolved were to be liquidated by the Directorate of Social Security, and that the proceeds of the liquidation should be credited to the workers who were benefiting from, or on whose behalf contributions were made to the fund in question. Lastly, section  of the Act provided that employers who had been required to contribute to such external funds should discontinue their contributions and increase in a corresponding amount the remuneration of workers on whose behalf the contributions had been made; moreover, it empowered the above-mentioned Directorate to resolve all questions arising in connection with the application of the Act and the liquidation of the funds concerned. The Trade Union Benefit Fund for Leather and Shoe Workers failed to obtain legal status with the required term, and thus qualified for extinction and liquidation. However, in spite of the time elapsed, it has not been possible to secure any of its assets for liquidation because the ex-directors of the Fund decided to sue use its assets to purchase the SOCORE enterprise using all of the Fund's resources for this purpose, and becoming the majority shareholder in SOCORE with  per cent of the shares. The directors of the enterprise are the same person who served as directors of the ex-Fund; they received monthy directors' fees until all available funds were exhausted and spent the proceeds for the sale of most of the ex-Fund's real property without any benefit to any of the workers, under the pretext that neither the law, nor the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor the Directorate of Social Security could liquidate the Fund, arguing that such liquidation could be carried out only by the workers, through their Board of Directors. For this reason, the enterprise has been forced to suspend payments. The financial direction of SOCORE has been assumed by the Securities and Exchange Commission which, in keeping with its legal authority, has been compelled to impose personal fines on its directors - in order to avoid",-1,1984,Chile
205,"prejudicing the enterprise and the workers - for their failure to abide by its resolutions inasmuch as they transferred shares which belong to the Fund in liquidation, as the enterprise's major shareholder, represented by the Directorate of Social Security, which has not been able to influence its administration directly or indirectly. All the fines have been appealed to the Supreme Court, and have been confirmed by the courts, which have denied all actions for relief filed by the directors. The Directorate of Social Security, for its part, has filed suit against the directors and SOCORE in an effort to secure the total transfer of shares in accordance with the law, in order to carry out the liquidation of the Fund's assets and to turn over the proceeds to the workers who contributed to the Fund, and to prevent a group within the Fund, and to prevent a group with the Fund from deriving the exclusive benefit of such assets. The preventive measures decreed by the courts, which prohibit the signing of instruments or contracts concerning the three remaining properties, have prevented the sale of these assets and the and the complete disappearance of the proceeds of leather and shoe workers' contributions to the Fund.
.Laslty, concerning the allegations that the Directorate of Social Security, as representative and liquidator of the Fund, has failed to collect for leather and shoe employers the sum of  million pesos which is allegedly owed to the Fund, the Government's communication states that this alleged debt is not formally recognised and has always been challenged by these employers. In accordance with its legal authority and by means of resolution No.  of  November , the Directorate of Social Security concluded that the employers were only required to contribute to the Fund until  May , the date of the Fund's legal extinction. As the alleged debt would have accrued since that date, it is clearly without grounds. Likewise, it was resolved that all who at one time were required to contribute to the Fund, were required to increase the remuneration of workers as from  August , under the supervision of the Labour Directorate. The resolution was duly communicated to all officials of trade unions involved with funds in liquidation; there were no administrative or judicial claims or objections. As regards the case at hand, the former ex-officials of the Fund and the directors of SOCORE were notified towards the end of November .
.The allegations which remained outstanding following the Committee's last examination of this case in May , concerned the visits of unidentified persons to the homes of several leaders of the Catering Confederation and the E Surco Peasants' Confederation; the reasons for the indictment against Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing; the dismissal of teachers, among them of a number of trade unionists, pursuant to Official Letter No.  of  March  of the Ministry of the Interior; the illegal search carried out on the premises of the Confederation of Textile and CLothing Workers (CONTEVECH), as well as that of the homes of several national trade union officials. Since then new allegations have been made concerning the dismissal of teachers and officials of the AGECH and of the Teachers' College of Chile pursuant to Official Letter No.  of  March  of the Ministry of the Interior; threats against the lives of several officials of the AGECH, of the Teachers' College, of the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar and of the Trade Union of Workers in Commerce; the violent break-up by police forces of a nation-wide protest called on  March  by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), which resulted in the injury and arrest of several leaders of that organisation; the arrest of three officials of the Teachers' College and nine teachers at a peaceful demonstration of  February  held in front of the Ministry of Education; the liquidation by administrative authorities of a Trade Union Benefit Fund for Workers in the leather and shoe industry and the efforts to liquidate a construction and leasing company (SOCORE). Other allegations concern a number of violations of trade union rights: the death of a trade unionist, the arrest and ill-treatment of several trade union leaders, the imprisonment of several miners for having participated in protest days, the attempted homicide of trade unionists and the refusal to allow a number of trade union leaders to enter the country; the refusal by an employer to recognise and to enter into a collective agreement with the workers' representatives; the incompatibility which legislation establishes between the holding of trade union office and affiliation with political parties, and the requirement that trade union leaders sign an affidavit upon their election concerning any political affiliation; the ineligibility of a trade union official of the National Peasants' Confederation to hold the presidency of that organisation on the grounds that he has been charged with participating in protest days; the arrest and harrassment by security forces of dozens of workers and trade unionists following the authority's refusal to allow a national day of protest convened by the CNT for  October ; and lastly repeated threats against the lives of trade union leaders of the CNT, and in particular, against its President, Manuel Bustos, and the court summons, filed at the instigation of the Ministry of the Interior, of CNT leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Marnez and Moiss Labrana, and their subsequent imprisonment in the Santiago Penitentiary after questioning by a Judge of the Supreme Court, on  October .
.As regards the allegations of several Chilean confederations concerning the visits by unidentified persons at the homes of Manuel Caro Castro and Enrique Avendao Atenas, leaders of the Catering Confederation and the El Sucro Peasants' Confederation, respectively, the Committee notes that the authorities investigated these charges and ascertained that no complaints were lodged in this connection; they further report, that no warrants have been issued for the arrest of these trade unionists, and that there is no information concerning the alleged search of the headquarters of these organisations. In view of the fact that many allegations of this kind have been received since the opening of this case, the Committee wishes to recall that trade union rights many only be exercised in a climate free of violence, pressure and threat of any kind against trade unionists. It again requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible judicial investigations with a view to determining who is responsible for these alleged actions.
.As regards the grounds for the charges against Beatriz Brikmann Schihing, the Committee notes that she has been accused of a crime under section  of Act No.  concerning arms control. The Committee understands that the judicial proceedings against Mrs. Brikmann are still in progress and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the case and its outcome.
.As regards the search of the headquarters of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing WOrkers (CONTEVECH), the Committee notes that proceedings for illegal search are at theindictment stage, and therefore secret; it requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings.
.As regards the arrest of three leaders of the Teachers' College, namely Messrs. Osvaldo Verdugo, Luis Cisternas and Pedro Soto, and of nine other teachers on  February , during a demonstration organised in front of the Ministry of Education to protest the dismissal of teachers, the Committe notes that the three trade union leaders were released after having been fined  pesos each for disturbing the peace, pending summons by the Third Police Court of Santiago, and that the nine teachers were released unconditionally on that same day. The Committee recalls that the right to organise public demonstrations is an important aspect of trade union rights.
.As regards the allegations made by several national and international trade union organisations concerning the dismissal of teachers pursuant to Official Letter No.  of  March  of the Ministry of the Interior, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these measures concern a general restructuring of the educational system, which aims at reducing a surplus of teachers which dates back to the s, and to ensure that all teachers are duly accredited. The Committee wishes to point out that these measures fall beyond the scope of freedom of association; nevertheless, it notes with concern the high number of national and local leaders of teachers' trade unions who have been dismissed following the promulgation of this Official Letter. The Committee also notes that the complainants allege that duly accredited and experienced teachers have also been dismissed. In these circumstances, although aware that the Government has instituted a number of flexible measures to facilitate the reintegration of teachers, the Committee wishes to recall the principle contained in Recommendation No.  concerning the protection and facilities to be afforded to workers' representatives in the undertaking, which advocates specific measures of protection, including the ""recognition of a priority to be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment",-1,1984,Chile
206,"in case of reduction of the workforce"".
.As regards the communication of the National Confederation of Trade Unions of Leather and Shoe Workers, (ex FONACC), which alleges that the assets of workers in this sector, including the SOCORE S.A. enterprise, may be confiscated by the administrative authorities, thus extinguishing the trade union and the debt of  million pesos owed by employers for contributions dating back to  August , the Committee notes the Government's explanations concerning the reasons why it ordered the liquidation of this Trade Union Benefit Fund. The Committee understands that the complainants have not legally objected to the Fund's liquidation, and that the complaint is based primarily on the question of the ownership of the assets of the SOCORE enterprise and on its current legal status; in other words, whether its assets belong to the Trade Union Benefit Fund, in liquidation, represented by the Directorate of Social Security, or whether the Fund is an independent body. The Committee also notes that the Government maintains that the dissolution of SOCORE has not been approved by the true representatives of the SOCORE has not been approved by the true representatives of the shareholders, that this matter can only be settled by the ordinary courts of law, and that all judicial appeals referred to by the complainant have gone against the Board of Directors of SOCORE S.A. The Committe notes that the Securities and Exchange Commission has only investigated whether the directors of this enterprise have complied with the law, without seeking at any time to call into question their status as trade union officials. As regards the alleged debt representing employer contributions which would have accrued since the Fund was ordered to liquidate, the Committee notes that this debt is not recognised and that this is not an issue calling for a decision on its part. The Committee wishes to point out that it is not convinced by the allegations presented that the exercise of the trade union rights of the National Confederation of Trade Unions of Leather and Shoe Workers, ex FONACC, has been restricted, or that there has been any interference by the administrative authorities in the management and activities of the trade union. Therefore, the Committee considers that the legal aspects concerning the administration and status of the SOCORE enterprise are not trade union matters.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not furnished observations concerning a number of allegations presented in this case, namely: threats made on  February  against the lives of trade union leaders of the AGECH, of the Teachers' College in the Fifth District, of the Teachers' Trade Union of Via del Mar and of the Trade Union of Workers in Commerce; the intervention of police forces on  March  in a nation-wide mobilisation of workers convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT), which led to the injury and arrest of leaders of that organisation; the problems encountered by the workers of the Baby Colloky enterprise in signing a collective agreement, and the refusal of the enterprise to recognise the workers' representatives; the complaints submitted by the National Confederation of Trade Unions, Federations and Associations of Workers in the Private Sector concerning legal provisions which make the holding of trade union office incompatible with affiliation with a political party, as well as the requirement that trade union officials, upon their election, sign an affidavit concerning any political affiliation; the ineligibility of the President of the National Peasants' Confederation to occupy the office to which he was elected by the Congress of that organisationn, because he had been arrested and charged under the National Security Act for having participated in an industrial action as a trade union leader; the arrest and aggression by security forces of dozens of workers and trade unionists following the authorities' refusal to allow a national protest day convened by the CNT for  October , and repeated threats against the lives of CNT leaders, in particular its President, Manuel Bustos, as well as the judicial summons, at the instigation of the Ministry of the Interior, of Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labrana, trade union leaders of the CNT and their subsequent imprisonment in the Santiago Penitentiary after questioning by a Judge of the Supreme Court, on  October .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The committee expresses its serious concern at the large number of complaints filed since its most recent examination of this case, which reflect the serious difficulties faced by the trade union movement and its leaders.(b) As regards the allegations of several Chilean confederations concerning the visits by unidentified persons to the homes of leaders of the Catering Confederation and the El Surco Peasants' Confederation, and in light of the many allegations of this nature submitted since this case was opened, the Committee urges the Government to undertake judicial investigations with a view to identifying the parties responsible for such alleged actions against trade unionists, and to ensure the normal development of trade union activities in a climate free of intimidation and fear.(c) As regards the proceedings against Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing for breach of Act No.  on arms control, the Committe requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in these proceedings and the outcome of the case.(d) As regards the searches carried out at the headquarters of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH), the Committe requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings in progress concerning the illegal search of these trade union premises.(e) As regards the arrest of three leaders of the Teachers' College and of nine teachers who participated in a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Education on  February , the Committee recalls that the right to organise public demonstrations is an important aspect of trade union rights, and that public authorities should refrain from any form of intervention which undermines the right of trade unions to organise and hold public demonstrations in defence of their rights and claims.(f) As regards the dismissal of teachers pursuant to Official Letter No.  of the Ministry of the Interior, including the dismissal of a number of national and local trade union leaders, the Committee wishes to point out, in particular, the danger that the dismissal of trade union leaders, in this particular case within the context of an administrative reform of the educational system, and the consequent loss of trade union office, may restrict the freedom of action of the trade unions to which they belong and their right to elect their representatives freely. The Committee urges the Government to consider the possiblity, within the measures of flexibility instituted for the reintegration of teachers, of giving special attention to the case of teachers' trade union officials who had been dismissed throughout the country.(g) As regards the communication of the National Confederation of Trade Unions of Leather and Shoe Workers (ex FONACC), the Committee wishes to point out that the legal aspects of the administration and status of the SOCORE enterprise are not trade union matters; it therefore considers that this question falls beyond its competence and that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination. (h) Lastly, the Committee urges the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which no replies have yet been received.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )).
.Subsequently, the ILO received the following communications from the complainants: World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  October ,  January and  February ; National Federation of Unions of Textile, Clothing and Allied Workers (FENATRATEX):  November ; and Miners' Confederation of Chile:  December . The Government transmitted observations in communications of  January and  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body approved various definitive conclusions reached by the Committee on certain pending allegations. The Committee also requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeals lodged with the courts by six workers dismissed from the National Copper Corporation. Finally, the Committee had requested the Government to supply comprehensive observations on the most recent allegations presented in this case and summarised below.
.Attached to an ICFTU communication was a report of the Centre for Trade Union Research and Assistance in which it was alleged that early in the morning of  May , the trade union premises belonging to the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers had been illegally searched.
.In its communication of  June , the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company",-1,1984,Chile
207,"of Chile stated that on  April  it had presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on  April , raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article  of Legislative Decree No. . On  May , after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the  members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union pointed out that the persons concerned were covered by an indefinite work contract and had more than  years' continuous service in the undertaking. The union added that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on  May  a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicated that it had submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.
.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleged that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since  July . On several occasions, armed and masked civilians had conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers had been rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home had again been searched and his wife severely beaten.
.In its communication of  September , the FISE referred to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE feared that his life was in danger.
.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, referred to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation pointed out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, had been sought by persons in civilian clothes on  September , when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
.CONSTRAMET indicated that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno had been sought by the police since the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency,  September . Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, was under permanent surveillance, as were the Confederation's offices. The complainant organisation also indicated that the police authorities had prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.
.FENATRATEX referred to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explained that these officials had been declared responsible for the fact that  of the  workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on  September , as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which had been occupied by law enforcement agents. The undertaking then arbitrarily applied sections . and . of Legislative Decree No.  which penalises unlawful acts preventing the worker from being present at his work or discharging his obligations as a worker and the direction of or active participation in any unlawful interruption or stoppage of work. The dismissals were decided without notice being given, without the right to compensation and in contravention of ""trade union immunity"".
.FENATRATEX indicated that  workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking had had to take the risk of meeting in private houses to discuss a draft collective agreement since a consequence of the proclamation of the state of emergency was to prohibit meetings of trade unions which do not possess their own premises.
.The Miners' Confederation alleged that several trade unionists had been dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining: in particular, the former official of the Lota Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), Fresia Mellado Opazo, and ten workers of Union No.  of Victoria de Lbu. It was alleged further that an official of ENACAR Union No. , Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, had been disqualified from holding his union post and that workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, including the trade union official Rolando Chacana Ganza, had been arrested for purported theft of explosives. Lastly, it was alleged that, at the Agustinas de Copiapo mine, the Agustinas mining enterprise had unilaterally decided to lower salaries in  and  at a time when the collective agreement was in force.
.Finally, in a joint letter several Chilean national confederations indicated that the homes of officials of the Catering Confederation and the El Surco, Manuel Caro Castro and Enrique Avendao Atenas Peasants' Confederation had been visited by unidentified persons.
.In its communication of  October , the WCOTP refers to acts committed against teachers and their trade union officials since proclamation of the state of emergency in the country. Thus, on  September , Mr. Gaston Vidaurrazaga Manriquez was taken from his home and murdered. His body was found south of Santiago. Three other teacher trade union officials, Nelly Lemus, Julio Lobos and Berta Moya were threatened with death.
.The WCOTP also refers to the detention of Guillermo Scherping Villegas, Under-General-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) (already mentioned in an earlier complaint) and of Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing, teacher, who has been in jail since  September .
.Lastly, the WCOTP alleges the dismissal of several teachers, including Mr. Fernando Azula, a national official of AGECH, who had previously been dismissed from educational institutions in  and . On  September , an armed forces group searched his home, and he was held in custody for some time. During a visit to Spain, he had given an interview on  August  to the newspaper ""El Tiempo"". On  September , he was dismissed by Presidential Decree No.  for having made that statement to the press. The WCOTP believes that his dismissal was mainly due to his trade union activities.
.In its communication of  November , FENATRATEX complains of the withdrawal of the legal personality of the Inter-Works Union of Workers of Textile Enterprises of Santiago Province. This measure is alleged to have been taken because the union had complained to the Minister of Labour about anomalies in the textile sector. The withdrawal of the legal personality will also entail, for the second time, the seizure of its assets, inherited by virtue of a judicial decision from the industrial union ""Tejidos Musalem"" (its property had been seized for the first time in ).
.In its communication of  December , the Miners' Confederation of Chile indicates that on  November  two officials of Trade Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise's Lota plant were arrested and required to open the union's office so that a search could be made. Since nothing was found, the two officials were freed. On  December, however, a group from the National Centre of Investigations again searched the union's office, where this time pamphlets and explosives mysteriously appeared. A union official, Julio Salazar Sierra, and one of its members, Patricio Sanhuza, were arrested.
.In its communication of  January , the WCOTP refers to the Minister of the Interior's adoption of an Order (No. ) dated  May  and concerning the reduction of the number of teachers in municipal schools. According to the instructions contained in this order, the Minister did not intend to extend the contracts of retired teachers, or those over  having  years of service, or those having more than  years of service. Later on, those teachers who did not have the necessary qualifications would apparently be dismissed. According to the WCOTP, this order was used differently: working teachers who were well qualified were dismissed because of their trade union activities. The WCOTP quotes a statement made by the Superintendent of the Concepcin region to the effect that ""political agitation will not be tolerated in schools"". It considers that there is a real danger that trade union activities will be deemed to be political agitation.
.In support of the allegations contained in its communicatioin of  February , the WCOTP supplies a list of  officials of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) and of  officials of the Teachers' College of Chile who have been dismissed. It also supplies the breakdown, by province, of the number of dismissed teachers, which has now reached ,.
.As regards the judicial appeals lodged by six workers dismissed from the National Copper Corporation, the Government indicates that the judge at El Salvador only allowed one of these workers' appeals (that of Mr. Ral Nuez Tapia) and ordered",-1,1984,Chile
208,"his reinstatement with payment of lost wages. The other appeals were rejected because the judge considered that the dismissals had been carried out in accordance with the law. A further appeal was then lodged with the Appeals Court, but was eventually withdrawn since those concerned had reached an agreement out of court on the payment of compensation.
.As regards the denial of the right of replacement operators of the Telephone Company of Chile to bargain collectively, the Government indicates that on  April  the negotiating committee appointed by the governing body of the company's union of workers submitted a draft collective agreement to the company, which replied to the committee within the legal time-limit.
.On  May , the workers' representative submitted a complaint to the Directorate of Labour, in exercise of the right granted by law, concerning the observations made by the enterprise in its reply, in particular as regards the exclusion of replacement operators from the draft collective agreement. On examining the individual employment contracts of these employees, the Directorate of Labour noted that the contracts contained a clause prohibiting them from bargaining collectively and from participating in negotiating committees. This clause had to be taken into account by the Directorate of Labour, since any document or contract signed or concluded in accordance with the legal formalities remains fully valid so long as it has not been declared null and void by a final judgement of the courts.
.The Government adds that administrative bodies like the Directorate of Labour are not competent to declare a contract's clause null and void. The collective bargaining exercise could thus not be the legal forum for declaring the validity or nullity of the clause in question. The replacement operators had been entitled by law to appeal to the courts within a period of  days from the date of their contract if they felt that the prohibition of collective bargaining it contained was not applicable to them, or to request, at any time, nullification of the clause. They had not, however, made use of those rights.
.On  June , the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company of Chile lodged an appeal with the Santiago Court of Appeals against the decision of the Directorate of Labour, which it considered arbitrary and illegal. The appeal was rejected in an order dated  July . Appeals were then submitted to the Supreme Court of Justice, which also rejected them.
.In the Government's opinion, the decision of the Directorate of Labour was neither illegal nor arbitrary, since it was pronounced at the union's request in pursuance of section  of Legislative Decree No.  on collective bargaining. On the contrary, it would have been arbitrary for the Directorate of Labour to disregard the effects of the clause prohibiting replacement operators from bargaining collectively. The Government also states that the Directorate of Labour's decision was not pronounced after the time-limit, for in order to be able to decide the question, it had had to request information from the negotiating parties for another decision adopted on  May . The final decision was issued on  May  after the information had been furnished on  May.
.Regarding the alleged police searches for Mr. Sergio Troncoso Cisternas, President of the National Confederation of Trade Unions in the Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, and Messrs. Jos Ramn Avello Soto, Ronaldo Muez Moreno and Humberto Arcos Vera, officials of the Metallurgy Trade Unions Confederation, the Government states that the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior have not handed down any decision which might have affected the liberty of these persons on the date indicated.
.As for the dismissal of three trade union leaders by the Via dye works, the Government states that their employment contracts had been terminated in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  for having led an illegal strike on  September . Those concerned had lodged a judicial appeal against this decision, requesting the cancellation of the dismissals and payment of the corresponding compensation.
.As regards the difficulties encountered by workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking in meeting to discuss a collective agreement, the Government states that these workers undertook a strike from  November to  December  which was before the signature of a new collective agreement between the parties, an agreement has now been fully implemented.
.As for the dismissal of trade unionists by the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), the Government points out that the person referred to by the complainants, Mrs. Fresia Mellado Opazo, had not been a trade union official at the time of the collective bargaining in the Lota undertaking, that is, in September . Contrary to the complainants' claims, neither was she a member of the negotiating committee. The Government explains that she had had trade union responsibilities in , but the workers themselves had demanded her resignation and she had not been re-elected. According to the Government, the reasons for her dismissal were therefore not related to the collective bargaining.
.In the Lbu undertaking of the same enterprise, the leaders of Union No.  had called an illegal strike on  and  July . The enterprise considered that this attitude infringed the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  on trade union organisations of  (section ) which prohibits trade unions from carrying out acts aimed at endangering the rights laid down in the Constitution and laws, in particular freedom of the individual and the right to work. According to the Government, in the present case there was no problem linked to the economic situation of the workers in the enterprise, and the collective bargaining procedure was not under way. The enterprise requested the courts to dissolve the trade union, relying on section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , namely, serious non-observance of legal provisions or regulations. The judge rejected the request for dissolution and the trade union is therefore still functioning. In addition, relying on section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , ENACAR, in July , terminated the contracts of ten workers of the Lbu undertaking for not having correctly and responsibly carried out their functions. The workers concerned signed receipts and received the legal compensation. None of them lodged an appeal with the labour inspectorate or the courts. According to the Government, it is not correct to state that these workers were dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining because the dismissals dated from July , whereas bargaining commenced in November .
.Regarding the disqualification of the official of Union No.  of ENACAR (Lota), the Government explains that the enterprise had requested the courts to dismiss this person. While proceedings were under way an agreement had been reached between the enterprise and the person concerned, according to which he would resign from the enterprise in return for the payment of a voluntary indemnity without prejudice to the contractual and legal compensation provided for. On  October , Mr. Salazar irrevocably renounced his responsibilities as a trade union leader as is shown from the letters he signed in front of a notary public and which he sent to the trade union's executive and to the labour inspectorate of Coronel.
.As regards the arrest of workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, the Government indicates that, when the undertaking noticed that explosives were missing during an inventory, it filed a complaint with the courts. They ordered the arrest of three workers of the undertaking, who were released after an inquiry and against whom no charges were laid. The persons concerned are still working in the undertaking without any problem whatsoever.
.As regards the reduction in salaries unilaterally decided by the Agustinas mining enterprise, the Government states that the Regional Labour Directorate of Atacama had dispatched a labour inspector, who had been able to note that  of the  workers had agreed to changes in their labour contracts. These changes involved an update of their functions and a change in the remuneration structure abolishing bonuses and increasing the basic wage. There was thus no loss in the monthly amount received. When questioned, the workers concerned stated that they had voluntarily signed the changes with a view to normalising the situation of their remuneration. The president of the trade union in the undertaking stated, for his part, that there were no problems pending because the collective agreement was faithfully applied.
.According to the Government, the death of the teacher Gaston Vidaurrazaga Manriquez was investigated by the police; according to the police report this person was kidnapped on  September  and his body found around three hours later showing traces of gunshots and injuries caused by blunt instruments. A magistrate has been appointed to investigate the matter and the inquiry is under way. As regards the death threats made against three teachers, the Government states that the persons concerned have lodged appeals for constitutional protection with the courts.
.Mr. Guillermo Scherping Villegas, referred to in the WCOTP and FISE complaints, was arrested in application of the provisions",-1,1984,Chile
209,"of the state of emergency under Supreme Decree No.  of  September . On  September he was placed at the disposal of the Third Police Prefecture at Santiago. On  November the Ministry of the Interior ordered his release. According to the Government, his arrest was in no way connected to his supposed trade union activities.
.As regards the arrest of Mrs. Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing, the Government states that she was placed at the disposal of the military prosecutor. Proceedings against her are at the investigation stage. She is accused of having committed offences punishable under section  of Act No.  on weapons control which concerns the creation or operations of private militias, combat groups or militarily organised parties. She is held at the Teja Island detention centre and has filed an appeal with the military courts, which is being heard. The Government states that meetings had been held in her home with a view to organising subversive actions.
.According to the Government, the dismissal of Mr. Azula Ponce, a teacher and official of AGECH, followed his earlier dismissals in  and  from municipal and subsidised colleges for complete disrespect of the orders of his superiors. Despite that, the Ministry of Education had re-employed him in establishments coming within its competence. The authorities had periodically met with him and had even intervened to obtain his release when he had been arrested for anti-Government activities. During a trip to Spain, he had given an interview to a newspaper during which he had supplied incorrect figures and given opinions, inappropriate for a public servant, on the Chilean educational system and on the Government. The Minister of Education considered his behaviour disloyal and contrary to public service ethics. His dismissal was confirmed by the Supreme Court with whom he had lodged an appeal. According to the Government, is is therefore not true to state that his dismissal was linked to his position as an official in a teachers' association.
.The Government refers to each of the alleged dismissals of other teachers, indicating that these measures were a result of errors of professional ethics (refusal to obey the orders of superiors), of the use of measures incompatible with the policy of participation in schools, insufficient qualifications and professional problems.
.As regards the complaint concerning the situation of the Inter-Works Union of Workers of Textile Enterprises of Santiago Province, the Government recalls that the transfer of assets of the trade union organisations of the textile sector which had been declared illegal in  had already been examined by the Committee at its meeting of November . It observes that, contrary to the situation that existed at that time, Chilean legislation no longer permits dissolution of trade unions by administrative action since the adoption of Legislative Decree No. , published in the Official Gazette of  July . Under that Decree (section ), where a trade union is dissolved, its assets are used for the purposes specified in the statutes. Where no purpose is expressly mentioned, the President of the Republic specifies the purpose to which they are to be applied, which shall be to the advantage of a non-profitmaking body corporate, an effort being made, where possible, to ensure that they are used for the benefit of the workers living in the locality, commune, province or region where the trade union had its office.
.As regards the dismissal of six workers by the National Copper Corporation, the Committee notes that the courts ordered the reinstatement of one of those concerned, and that the others have withdrawn their appeals from the Court of Appeal after having arrived at an agreement with the undertaking.
.With reference to the allegations regarding the right of replacement operators of the Telephone Company of Chile to collective bargaining, the Committee takes note of the Government's explanations to the effect that the individual employment contracts of these employees prohibited them from bargaining collectively and that the Directorate of Labour was not competent to annul clauses of the contracts. The Committee also notes that those concerned did not appeal the matter to the courts that could decide on the possible nullity of such clauses. It must, however, draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right to free collective bargaining for all employees other than those acting as agents of the public authority is a basic trade union right (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Peru), para. ) and that consequently all telecommunications workers should enjoy that right. In the present case the Committee therefore considers that individual employment contracts should not contain clauses denying their holders the right to collective bargaining.
.As regards the police searches for trade union leaders of the building and metallurgy sectors, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, no such orders were given by the Ministry of the Interior, and that the persons concerned are free.
.The Committee notes as regards the dismissal of three trade union leaders of the Via dye works that the persons concerned appealed against the dismissals to the courts.
.As regards the difficulties encountered by workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking in meeting to discuss a collective agreement, the Committee notes that the Government limits itself to stating that a collective agreement was concluded in the undertaking, without referring to the alleged violations of the right of assembly. The Committee must therefore recall that the right of trade unions to organise meetings freely constitutes a basic element of freedom of association, all the more so when collective bargaining is being prepared since that is a fundamental activity of trade union organisations.
.The Committee notes that as regards the dismissals in the coalmining sector (ENACAR company), the Committee notes that the workers concerned received the legal compensation and did not lodge appeals with the courts. Nevertheless, it observes that these dismissals were carried out after a strike had taken place, which the Government describes as illegal. In this respect, the Committee must point out that the exercise of the right to strike should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved by a particular collective agreement. Workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wish, their dissatisfaction as concerns economic and social matters affecting the interests of their members (see, for example, st Report, Case No.  (Tunisia), para. ). The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the dismissals which took place following strikes of this kind are acts of anti-union discrimination contrary to the principle of freedom of association.
.As regards the disqualification of Mr. Salazar, an official of Union No.  of ENACAR (Lota), the Committee notes that he arrived at an agreement with the enterprise and resigned from his trade union functions in a letter signed in front of a notary public. The Committee therefore considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Comittee notes that the three workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking were arrested in the context of an inquiry into the theft of explosives and that they were released without having been charged. Given that these questions do not come within the domain of freedom of association, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the allegations concerning the reduction of salaries in the Agustinas mining enterprise, the Committee observes that the changes came about after an agreement had been signed with the workers of the enterprise with a view to changing the remuneration structure without any financial loss, and that the enterprise's collective agreement is being fully applied. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee notes that the death of the teacher Gaston Vidaurrazaga Manriquez, mentioned in the WCOTP complaint, is the subject of a judicial inquiry.
.As regards the arrest of the AGECH trade unionists Guillermo Scherping Villegas and Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing, the Committee observes that the former was arrested under the state of emergency provisions, then released, and that the latter is detained for violation of the Act on weapons control. The Committee regrets that, in the case of Mr. Scherping, the Government did not supply details on the specific facts which gave rise to his arrest and that, in the case of Mrs. Brikmann, it limits itself to stating that she organised subversive meetings at her home. So as to be able to decide this latter question in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee should have at its disposal more detailed information on the nature and aims of these meetings.
.As regards the dismissals of teachers, the Committee notes that in certain cases these were based on reasons unconnected with freedom of association (insufficient qualifications, lack of discipline, professional problems). On the other hand, in the case of Mr. Azula Ponce, a national official of AGECH, the Government itself states that he was dismissed for having made statements to the press concerning the Chilean educational system. Given that",-1,1984,Chile
210,"this subject is within the competence of teachers' trade union organisations, the Committee would recall the provisions of the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The International Labour Conference pointed out on that occasion that freedom of opinion and expression and, in particular, the right not to be prejudiced because of one's opinions and the right to seek, receive and disseminate freely information and ideas through any means of expression, constitute civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.As to the situation of the Inter-Works Union of Workers of the Textile Enterprises of Santiago Province, the Committee observes that since , Chilean legislation no longer provides for the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority. On the question of the transfer of assets, the Committee notes that the provisions now in force leave the President of the Republic wide powers to decide what is to be done with a dissolved organisation's assets. The Committee must therefore emphasise, as it has already done in the present case when examining these allegations concerning dissolved organisations in the textile sector, that the assets of such organisations should ultimately be distributed among their members or handed over to their successor organisations, i.e. organisations which pursue the aims for which the dissolved trade unions were formed and which do so in the same spirit (see th Report, para. ).
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government had not replied to certain allegations presented in the present case, namely: the search of the premises of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers and of the homes of the president of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants' Federation and of officials of the ""El Surco"" Peasants' Confederation and the Catering Confederation; as well as the allegations contained in the most recent communications from the WCOTP concerning alleged dismissals for trade union activities under Order No.  on the reduction of teaching posts.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee expresses its concern over the large number of complaints presented in the present case which reflect the serious difficulties confronting the Chilean trade union movement and its leaders.b) As regards the denial of collective bargaining rights to replacement telephone operators of the Chile Telephone Company, the Committee considers that this category of workers should enjoy the right to collective bargaining, and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to annul clauses of individual employment contracts which deny employees that right.c) As regards the dismissal of three trade union leaders by the Via dye works, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial appeals lodged by those concerned.d) As regards the difficulties encountered by workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking, the Committee requests the Government to guarantee respect for the right of trade unions to meet freely, particularly in the context of preparations for collective bargaining.e) As regards the dismissals in the coalmining sector, the Committee emphasises that such measures should not be taken as a punishment for strike action.f) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation into the death of the teacher Gaston Vidaurrazaga Manriquez.g) The Committee requests the Government to supply more detailed information on the charges brought against Mrs. Beatriz Brikmann Scheihing.h) As regards the dismissal of Mr. Azula Ponce, an official of AGECH, the Committee requests the Government to guarantee respect for the freedom of expression of trade union leaders, in accordance with the Resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference, and to ensure that no trade union leader is punished for having exercised this freedom of speech.i) As regards the situation of the Inter-Works Union of Workers of Textile Enterprises of Santiago Province, the Committee notes that the legislation grants the President of the Republic wide powers to decide on the disposal of the assets of dissolved organisations, and requests the Government to amend the legislation so as to provide for distribution of the assets among the members or for their transfer to the organisations which succeed them.j) The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the search of the premises of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers and of the homes of several national trade union leaders, as well as on the dismissals allegedly carried out for trade union activities in the teaching sector.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions, most recently at its May  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June )).
.Since then, the ILO has received the following communications from the complainants: the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  May and  September ; the . Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC):  June ; the National Union of Telephone Company Workers:  June ; the World Federation of Teachers' Unions (FISE):  September ; Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile:  September ; the National Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, the Confederation of Unions and Federations of Workers in the Metal Industry (CONSTRAMET), the National Federation of Unions of Textile and Clothing Workers (FENTATREX), the Miners' Confederation, the El Surco Peasants Confederation, the Confederation of Catering Workers of Chile:  and  September . The Government, for its part, supplied its observations in communications of  May and  and  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The allegations still pending in this case concern the indictment of trade union leaders following protest days held in September  and of two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers; the death of four persons during demonstrations in November ; the dismissal of Manuel Jerez, trade union official in the port sector; the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in the docks sector; the arrest of Juan Bustos Araneda, official of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers; the intervention of law enforcement agents to prevent the holding of a national trade union conference; the transfer to a state body of the assets of organisations declared to be unlawful and numerous arrests and searches of trade union premises at the time of the  May  celebrations.
.At its May-June  Session, the Governing Body approved in particular, the following conclusions of the Committee: - Regarding the charges against  trade union leaders following protest days held in September , the Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the current trials and their outcome, as soon as the judgements are handed down.- The Committee also once again requests the Government to furnish information on the death of four persons during the demonstrations of  and  November .- Concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders, the Committee requests the Government to furnish information on developments in the current proceedings involving Mr. Manuel Jerez, trade union leader of the port sector.- Concerning the indictments against two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers, the Committee considers that the expression of an opinion by a trade union organisation concerning a court decision relative to the killing of trade union members, does in fact constitute a legitimate trade union activity. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that in expressing their opinions, trade union organisations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language. The Committee requests the Government to transmit the text of the letter sent by the Confederation of Building Workers to the Supreme Court and to keep it informed of the developments in the proceedings against the two leaders of this Confederation.- The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the most recent allegations in this case, namely, the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in the docks sector; the arrest of Juan Bustos Araneda, an official of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers; the intervention of law enforcement agents to prevent the holding of a national trade union conference; the transfer to a state body of the assets of organisations declared to be illegal; the numerous arrests and searches of trade union premises at the time of the  May  celebrations.
.In its communication of  May , the ICFTU supplies a report prepared by the Centre for Trade Union Research and Assistance on the events which occurred on  May  in Santiago.
.The report indicates that the state of emergency in force in the country severely restricts the right of assembly expressly enshrined in the Constitution. The provisions in force in Santiago are governed by Orders Nos.  and  which require",-1,1984,Chile
211,"that a request be made with ten days' notice for authorisation by the Chief of the area under the state of emergency to hold meetings in public places. The National Grouping of Workers (CNT) satisfied these requirements but did not even receive an acknowledgement in reply. In view of this situation, the CNT leadership called on the workers and the population of Santiago to meet on the Plaza de los Hroes on  May at  a.m.
.The report also indicates that on  April the authorities had prevented the holding of an artistic and cultural event at union premises of the Confederation of Leather and Footwear Workers to celebrate May Day.
.On  May the city of Santiago was practically occupied by the police and the military. In spite of this climate, thousands of people approached the meeting place and, when the first groups formed, the police forces hurled projectiles and tear gas at them. Dozens of persons were wounded. All persons and all vehicles were checked and approximately  persons arrested, including Manuel Bustos, Vice-President of the CNT, Jorge Mills, a member of the national council of the CNT, and Humberto Arcos, an official of the Confederation of Unions of Workers in the Metal Industry. The majority of these persons were released on the same day with a summons to appear before the Police Court for having caused a disturbance of the peace.
.Also on the morning of  May, two trade union premises belonging to the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers (CONTEVECH) and to the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) were illegally searched. Furniture and documents were destroyed or removed. The persons present were threatened, certain of them were struck, and  teachers attending a meeting at the premises of the AGECH were arrested, although organisations with a legal personality (as in the case of the AGECH) are not required to request authorisation to hold meetings at their own premises to deal with matters within their competence.
.In its communication of  June , the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC) alleges that on  April  the Director-General for Industrial Relations of the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO) notified  workers of the termination of their work contract on the basis of article (f) of Legislative Decree No. . This provision permits an employer to dismiss workers without specifying the grounds for dismissal, with  days' notice or by paying compensation of an amount equal to the last monthly wage. According to the CTC, this permits the Government and employers, as in this case, to take discriminatory measures against trade unions.
.The CTC states that all those affected by this measure were skilled workers, had behaved irreproachably and had from  to  years' service in the undertaking. The only possible grounds for their dismissal are therefore their active participation in trade union meetings and activities. Furthermore, four of them were about to become trade union officials. Moreover, this measure was intended to intimidate the workers in the undertaking in order to impede their trade union action. These assumptions are substantiated by the fact that on the day of the dismissals, the two unions of El Salvador with the largest number of affiliates had convened assemblies for the purpose of putting their affairs in order following the disqualification of their leaders decreed by the Ministry of Labour. These assemblies unanimously rejected the dismissals and condemned the measure taken by CODELCO. For ten days,  of the dismissed workers went on hunger strike.
.In its communication of  June , the National Union of Workers of the Telephone Company of Chile states that on  April  it presented a draft collective agreement to the Telephone Company in conformity with the legislation in force. The employer replied on  April , raising objections to the draft in respect of the situation of replacement telephone operators, although the latter are not among those workers barred from collective bargaining under article  of Legislative Decree No. . On  May , after compulsory arbitration proceedings had been initiated, the Director of Labour issued a resolution in which it was decided to exclude from collective bargaining the situation of the  members of the union employed as replacement operators. The union points out that the persons concerned are covered by an indefinite work contract and have more than  years' continuous service in the undertaking. The union adds that the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspector had issued on  May  a totally contrary resolution which recognised the right of these workers to participate in collective bargaining. Lastly, the union indicates that it submitted appeals to the courts but that the latter had not yet handed down their judgement.
.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleges that Juan Fernando Reyes, President of the ""El Roto Chileno"" Peasants' Federation of Curico and his family had been subjected to constant threats since  July . On several occasions, armed and masked civilians conducted night searches at his home and destroyed furniture and other objects. The appeal for protection submitted by his lawyers was rejected, as, according to police sources, no warrant for arrest or order of inquiry had been issued in his case. Since then, his home was again searched and his wife severely beaten.
.In its communication of  September , the FISE refers to the arrest by the security services of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, Under-Secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. The FISE fears that his life is in danger.
.Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile states in its communication of  September  that on  September police officers arrived at the Union's offices for the purpose of evicting the six workers referred to in a previous complaint presented by the Confederation of Copper Workers, as well as their families who had organised a soup kitchen on the premises since their dismissal by the National Copper Corporation, at a time when they enjoyed trade union ""immunity"". The police officer responsible for this eviction presented no document issued by a competent authority.
.The National Confederation of Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities, for its part, refers to the warrant issued for the arrest of its president, Sergio Troncoso Cisternas. The complainant organisation points out that Mr. Troncoso, who had already been detained on several occasions, was sought by persons in civilian clothes on  September , when he was in the German Democratic Republic to attend the Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
.CONSTRAMET indicates that its leaders Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Ronaldo Muez Moreno were sought by the police as of the day following the proclamation of the state of emergency,  September . Furthermore, a regional secretary of the organisation, Humberto Arcos Vera, is under permanent surveillance, as are the Confederation's offices. The complainant organisation also indicates that the police authorities prohibited meetings of several constituent unions (the Eugenio Gonzlez, Morgan and Fuenzalida Unions) which were in the process of negotiation.
.FENTATREX refers to the dismissal of three trade union officials by the Via dye works. It explains that these officials were declared responsible for the fact that  of the  workers in the undertaking did not arrive for work on the protest day held on  September , as they were without means of transport, sick or unable to leave their district which was occupied by law enforcement agents. The undertaking then arbitrarily applied sections . and . of Legislative Decree No.  which penalises unlawful acts preventing the worker from being present at his work or discharging his obligations as a worker and the direction of or active participation in any unlawful interruption or stoppage of work. The dismissals were decided without notice being given, without the right to compensation and in contravention of ""trade union immunity"".
.FENTATREX indicates that  workers at the San Martino textiles undertaking had to take the risk of meeting in private houses to discuss a draft collective agreement since a consequence of the proclamation of the state of emergency was to prohibit meetings of trade unions which do not possess their own premises.
.The Miners' Confederation alleges that several trade unionists were dismissed for having participated in collective bargaining: in particular, the former official of the Lota Union No.  of the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR), Fresia Mellado Opazo, and ten workers of Union No,  of Victoria de Lbu. It is alleged further that an official of ENACAR Union No. , Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, was disqualified from holding his union post and that workers at the Minero Cerro Negro undertaking, including the trade union official Rolando Chacana Ganza, were arrested for purported thefts of explosives. Lastly, it is alleged that, at the Agustinas de Copiapo mine, the Agustinas mining enterprise unilaterally decided to lower salaries in  and  at a time when the collective agreement was in force.
.Finally, in a joint letter several Chilean national confederations indicate that the homes of officials of",0,1984,Chile
212,"the Catering Confederation and the El Surco, Manuel Caro Castro and Enrique Avendao Atenas Peasants Confederation were visited by unidentified persons.
.As regards the indictments of  trade union leaders following the protest days of September , the Government indicates that the persons concerned were charged with contravening the State Security Act and, more specifically, on account of their responsibility in respect of acts of violence, deaths and damage to public and private property which were committed or provoked on that occasion. On  July , the judge dealing with the case passed a suspended sentence of  days' detention on these  persons. The suspended sentence means that the person concerned remains at liberty and has to sign a book at regular intervals. The magistrate considered that the sentences passed on Rodolfo Seguel Molina, Manuel Bustos Huerta and Mario Araneda Espinoza had been carried out. Furthermore, after the Ministry of the Interior had withdrawn its complaint against Eduardo Valencia Saez and Jorge Pavez Urrutia, the judge definitively dismissed the charges against these persons.
.On the subject of the death of four persons during demonstrations on  and  November , the Government indicates that these four persons (Jos del Trnsito Norambuena Canales, Emilia de las Mercedes Ulloa San Martn, Luis Hctor Peailillo Vega and Erwin Nstor Iturra Gonzlez) were not trade union leaders. The circumstances of their death are being investigated by the criminal or military courts and this preliminary investigation is a confidential phase of the proceedings. The Government reaffirms its opposition to such protests movements precisely by reason of the violence to which they give rise and, in many cases, the deaths that they cause.
.Regarding the dismissal of Manuel Jerez, a trade union leader in the port sector, the Government indicates that the Viento Sur Fishing Enterprise had requested on  October  the dismissal of Mr. Jerez at the Court of Talcahuano. The Court did not comply with the request of the undertaking and, consequently, the latter was not authorised to dismiss Mr. Jerez. As Mr. Jerez was nevertheless dismissed, he filed an appeal with the Court of Talcahuano, which declared the dismissal null and void and ordered his reinstatement with payment of wages due. The undertaking filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal of Concepcon, which upheld the judgement of the lower court. On  May , the judge ordered that the judgement be put into effect and on  May  the court acceeded to the request by Mr, Jerez to be reinstated in the undertaking.
.As regards the indictment of two officials of the Confederation of Building Workers, the Government states once again that these proceedings were initiated by the Plenary Assembly of the Supreme Court after the latter had taken cognisance of an insulting letter addressed to the magistrates of the Court. The Government reaffirms that the courts are independent of the Executive and that the Government did not intervene in these proceedings. The judge of the Court of Appeal of Santiago dealing with the case passed a suspended sentence on the persons concerned (a lesser sentence than that requested by the prosecutor). They therefore remained at liberty.
.The Government indicates in regard to the situation of dock workers that Act No.  adopted in September  altered the organisation of work applicable to maritime and port workers. This alteration, according to the Government, put an end to a practice that was extremely detrimental to workers whereby a work-permit holder would hire out his permit to other workers in exchange for one-half of the wages paid. This Act therefore received the broad support of the workers. The trade unions submitted additional claims in order to obtain further social advantages, and tripartite commissions were established to examine these claims. Following these discussions, Act No.  entered into force on l December  and introduced various amendments to the legislation applicable to port workers, in particular with regard to the setting up of a system for the negotiation of collective agreements and the obligation to conclude work contracts in advance in order to avoid a situation in which workers make themselves available to employers at the last moment and there are thus excessive numbers. The Act also made provision for substantial improvements in regard to social security. In the view of the Government, the new legislation therefore satisfies the major claims of the trade union organisations in the port sector. The Government attaches a letter from the Chilean Maritime Chamber which indicates that there has not been a strike in the docks sector; only some minority trade union groups had prevented their members from responding to offers of work from the employers.
.Regarding the arrest of Juan Bustos Araneda, the Government states that this person, who was responsible for cleaning the regional offices of the de facto organisation called the ""Democratic Central Organisation of Workers"", went to see the criminal judge of Concepcon on  March . Mr. Bustos explained to the judge that he had been abducted on  March by a group of armed civilians who questioned him about the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers and certain of its leaders, burned his face with cigarettes and finally released him at a port in the vicinity of Concepcon. The criminal judge of Concepcon ordered an inquiry on the day following the filing of the complaint by Mr. Bustos. The police service responsible for making inquiries informed the judge that it had been unable to identify the authors of the crime. The court therefore decreed the suspension of criminal proceedings.
.As regards the intervention of police forces to prevent the holding of a national conference called by the National Grouping of Workers, the Government indicates that this meeting was prohibited by the Military Command of the area under the state of emergency as it was of a partisan political nature. Nevertheless, this meeting took place subsequently at a reserved location and without publicity.
.On the subject of the transfer to a state body of the assets of the National Federation of Textile Workers, the Government states that the building situated at No.  Ejrcita Street in Santiago belonged to the FENTATREX Federation and the Professional Union of Private Employees and Workers in the Textile Industry of the Province of Santiago up to  October , the date of the promulgation of Legislative Decree No.  which declared these organisations to be unlawful. In conformity with article  of this legislative decree, the assets of the organisations concerned are transferred into the State domain and the Ministry of Interior is called upon to specify by supreme decree the assets in question and to indicate where they are to be transferred, as was done by Supreme Decree No.  of  November . The Government adds that the trade union concerned filed an application for the enforcement of its constitutional rights with the Court of Appeal of Santiago, which rejected the appeal in a judgement handed down on  April , the text of which is supplied by the Government.
.As regards the events of l May , the Government indicates that on that day in Santiago there were four cases of sabotage involving explosions and one case involving a fire. Furthermore, at various locations in the city traffic was interrupted by fires, stone-throwing, etc. The Government cannot consider these incidents to be an expression of freedom of association, and the steps taken by the Government to forestall or prevent them cannot therefore be qualified as a violation of freedom of association.
.The Government states further that the military authorities of the Santiago area filed a complaint of violation of the State Security Act for disturbances on the public thoroughfare, incitement to illegal obstruction of activities and disturbance of the peace againt  persons, including several teachers who are members of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH). The judges dealing with this case ordered on  May  the release of  of the  detainees for lack of evidence. The five remaining persons, teachers who are members of the AGECH, were also released on  May  for lack of evidence. Moreover, the AGECH filed a complaint in connection with the search carried out at its premises and the examining magistrate initiated an inquiry by visiting the offices of the organisation.
.As regards the dismissal of  workers on  April  at the El Salvador division of the National Copper Corporation, the Government states that these measures were taken for reasons related to the running of the enterprise. The six workers who were members of the El Salvador Union No.  filed appeals at the court of El Salvador, requesting that their dismissal be declared null and void. In regard to the eight other dismissed persons, various meetings were held at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour between the management of the enterprise and the trade unions. On  July , an agreement was concluded with the eight workers which made provision for the payment of compensation for years of",1,1984,Chile
213,"service and of all the benefits stipulated by the contract and the legislation in force. The Government stresses that these dismissals do not constitute acts of discrimination against trade unions but that the measures were simply taken on administrative grounds by virtue of the provisions in force. None of the workers holds or held office in a trade union.
.After the Committee's last examination of the case at its May  meeting, the allegations still pending concerned the indictment of trade union leaders following the protest days held in September ; the death of four persons during demonstrations in November ; the dismissal of Manuel Jerez, a trade union official in the port sector; the indictment of two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers following the sending of a letter considered to be insulting to magistrates of the Supreme Court; the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in the docks sector; the arrest of Juan Bustos Aranada, an official of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers; the intervention of law enforcement agents to prevent the holding of a national trade union conference; the transfer to a state body of the assets of organisations declared to be in violation of the law, and the arrests and searches of trade union premises that took place during the May Day celebrations. Since then, new allegations have been presented concerning the search of the premises of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers, the dismissal of  workers in the copper sector, interference with the right to collective bargaining of replacement operators of the Telephone Company of Chile; the arrest of Mr. Guillermo Scherping, an official of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile; the police inquiries and searches carried out against trade union leaders in the building, metal industry, catering and agriculture sectors; dismissals in the textile and coalmining sectors; the prohibition of union meetings of several constituent trade unions in the metal industry and textile sector; the disqualification of Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, a trade union official in the coalmining sector; the arrest of workers of the Minero Cerro Negro enterprise; and non-compliance with a collective agreement by the Agustinas mining enterprise.
.On the subject of the indictment of  trade union leaders following the protest days of September , the Committee notes that charges against two of them were dismissed and that the others were sentenced to  days' imprisonment, but that the sentence was suspended and they remained at liberty. The Committee wishes however to point out the danger to the free exercise of trade union rights of sentences passed against representatives of workers within the framework of activities related to the defence of the interests of those they represent.
.Regarding the death of four persons during the demonstrations of  and  November , the Committee notes that the circumstances of these deaths are being investigated by the criminal or military courts. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigations.
.In the case of the dismissal of Manual Jerez, a trade union official in the port sector, the Committee notes with interest that the courts dealing with the case annulled the measure taken by the undertaking and ordered his reinstatement.
.As regards the indictment of two officials of the Confederation of Building Workers for having addressed a letter, described as insulting and related to the killing of trade unionists, to magistrates of the Supreme Court, the Committee notes that the persons concerned were given suspended sentences and that they therefore remained at liberty. The Committee can therefore only stress once again that trade union organisations are perfectly within their rights in expressing themselves on a court decision in connection with proceedings relative to the killing of trade unionists. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that in expressing their opinions trade unions should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from using insulting language.
.With regard to the situation of the dock workers, the Committee notes that these allegations fall within the framework of the adoption of new legislation altering the organisation of work applicable to maritime and port workers. Considering therefore that this aspect of the case relates to a field which is not strictly connected to trade union rights, the Committee is of the view that these allegations do not call for further examination.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Juan Bustos Araneda, the Committee regrets that the individuals in civilian clothes who questioned him on the activities of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers were unable to be found. The Committee stresses that such incidents necessarily give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear that impedes the normal exercise of trade union activities. The Government should take the necessary measures to prevent acts of this nature, to complete the investigation into the matter and to bring those responsible before the competent courts.
.As regards the prohibition of a national trade union meeting organised by the National Grouping of Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this meeting was of a partisan political character. While noting that the meeting was able to be held subsequently, the Committee recalls that the right of trade unions freely to organise meetings at trade union premises, without the need for prior authorisation and without interference on the part of the public authorities, is an essential element of freedom of association.
.As regards the transfer to a state body of the assets of trade union organisations of the textile sector, which had been declared unlawful, the Committee recalls that in  it examined allegations concerning the dissolution of these organisations. It had pointed out at the time that this measure was not compatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be dissolved by administrative authority (see th Report, Case No. , para. ). The Committee must now stress that, when an organisation is dissolved, its assets must ultimately be distributed among its former members or handed over to the organisation that succeeds it; by this is meant the organisation or organisations which pursue the aims for which the dissolved trade union was established, and which pursue them in the same spirit (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Kenya), para. ). It must be noted that in this case the transfer of the assets of organisations declared to be unlawful was not in conformity with the principle in question.
.As regards the events which occurred on l May, the Committee notes that the arrested trade union officials were released a few days afterwards for lack of evidence. The Committee recalls in this regard that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is brought may give rise to restrictions of freedom of association. Governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities concerned receive appropriate instructions in order to avoid the danger inherent in detention measures as regards trade union activities (see, for example, lth Report, Case No.  (Haiti), para. ).
.The Committee notes further that the search carried out on  May  at the premises of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile is the subject of a judicial inquiry. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this inquiry.
.With regard to the dismissal of  workers of the National Copper Corporation, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these measures were taken for administrative reasons unrelated to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee notes also that eight of these workers signed an agreement with the enterprise and that the six others filed judicial appeals. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these appeals.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to supply comprehensive observations on the latest allegations in this case, namely: the search of the premises of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers; interference with the right to collective bargaining of replacement operators of the Telephone Company of Chile; the arrest of Guillermo Scherping, an official of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile; the police inquiries and searches carried out against trade union leaders in the building, metal industry, catering and agriculture sectors; the dismissals which occurred in the textile and coalmining sectors; the prohibition of trade union meetings of several constituent unions in the metal industry and textile sectors; the disqualification of Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, a trade union official in the coalmining sector, from holding his union post; the arrest of workers of the Minero Cerro Negro enterprise; and non-compliance with a collective agreement by the Agustinas mining enterprise.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) Regarding the charges against  trade unions leaders following the protest days held in September , the Committee notes that the charges against two of them were dismissed and that the others were sentenced to  days' imprisonment but that they remained at liberty. The Committee points out the danger to the free exercise of trade union",-1,1984,Chile
214,"rights of sentences passed against representatives of workers within the framework of activities related to the defence of the interests of those they represent.(b) Concerning the death of four persons during the demonstrations of  and  November , the Committee notes that the circumstances of these deaths are being investigated by the criminal or military courts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigations.(c) Concerning the dismissal of Manuel Jerez, trade union leader of the port sector, the Committee notes with interest that the courts dealing with the case annulled the measure taken by the undertaking and ordered his reinstatement.(d) Concerning the indictments against two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers, the Committee considers that the expression of an opinion by a trade union organisation concerning a court decision relative to the killing of trade union members is in fact a legitimate trade union activity.(e) As the allegations concerning the situation of dock workers relate to a field which is not strictly connected to trade union rights, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(f) Concerning the arrest of Juan Bustos Araneda, the Committee regrets that those responsible were unable to be found. It stresses that such incidents give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear that impedes the normal exercise of trade union activities. The Government should take the necessary measures to prevent acts of this nature, to complete the investigation into the matter and to bring those responsible before the competent courts.(g) Concerning the prohibition of a national trade union meeting organised by the National Grouping of Workers, the Committee, while noting that this meeting took place subsequently, recalls that the right of trade unions freely to organise meetings at trade union premises, without the need for prior authorisation and without interference on the part of the public authorities, is an essential element of freedom of association.(h) Concerning the transfer to a state body of assets of trade union organisations of the textile sector which had been declared unlawful, the Committee notes that these measures were not in conformity with the principle according to which the assets of dissolved organisations must ultimately be distributed among their former members or handed over to the organisations that succeed them.(i) Concerning the arrests of trade union leaders on l May , the Committee notes that the persons concerned were released a few days afterwards for lack of evidence. The Committee recalls that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is brought may give rise to restrictions on freedom of association. Governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities concerned receive appropriate instructions in order to avoid the danger inherent in detention measures as regards trade union activities.(j) The Committee notes that the search carried out at the premises of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile is the subject of a judicial inquiry. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this inquiry.(k) Concerning the dismissal of  workers of the National Copper Corporation, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these measures were taken for administrative reasons unrelated to the exercise of trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial appeals filed by six of the workers concerned.(l) The Committee requests the Government to supply comprehensive observations on the most recent allegations presented in this case, namely: the search of the premises of the Confederation of Textile and Clothing Workers; interference with the right to collective bargaining of the replacement operators of the Telephone Company of Chile; the arrest of Guillermo Scherping, official of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile; the police inquiries and searches carried out against trade union officials in the building, metal industry, catering and agriculture sectors; the dismissals in the textile and coalmining sectors; the prohibition of union meetings of several constituent trade unions in the metal industry and textile sectors; the disqualification of Juan Carlos Salazar Sierra, a trade union official in the coalmining sector, from holding his union post; the arrest of workers of the Minero Cerro Negro enterprise; and non-compliance with a collective agreement by the Agustinas mining enterprise.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions, most recently at its February  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. (See rd Report, paras. -, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March ).)
.Since then, the ILO has received the following communications from the complainants: the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  February ; the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  February,  and  March ,  and  April  as well as  May l; the Dockers' Union No.  of San Antonio:  March ; the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers:  April ; and the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  May l. The Government, for its part, sent its observations in communications of  March,  April and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The allegations still pending in this case concern the arrest and indictment of trade union leaders which occurred following a Protest Day held on  September ; the arrest of union leaders from the port sector during a demonstration; the banishment of trade union members and the dismissal of trade union leaders, particularly in the port and health care sectors. In addition, new allegations reported the death of four persons during the demonstrations of  and  November , the arrest of Rodemil Aranda, leader of the Trade Union of the Caletones mines, as well as the annulment of the elections held within the Copper Workers' Confederation and the confiscation of its assets.
.At its March  Session, the Governing Body approved the following conclusions of the Committee:a) Regarding the arrests and charges made following the Protest Day on  September , the Committee notes that  of the  trade union officials who were initially arrested and charged have been released on bail and that the charge against one of them has been dismissed. While noting that the charges were brought on the basis of provisions relating to the organisation of demonstrations on the public thoroughfare and illegal strikes, the Committee stresses that the prohibition on the calling of strikes by federations and confederations is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. It recalls that the occupational and economic interests which workers defend by resorting to strikes concern not only better conditions of work or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the search for solutions to economic and social policy questions. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the current trials and their outcome, as soon as judgements are handed down.b) Regarding the arrest of trade union officials in the port sector, the Committee notes that the persons concerned were released after the Minister of Labour stood bail for them. It requests the Government to supply information on developments in the proceedings initiated against them.c) Regarding the banishment of other trade unionists, the Committee firmly requests the Government once again to take the necessary steps to ensure that such measures, which do not provide for any judicial guarantees, are not taken again.d) Regarding the dismissal of trade union officials, the Committee notes that one trade unionist was dismissed for violation of the State Security Act and expresses its concern that workers can lose their jobs after being arrested or sentenced for having committed acts which the national legislation deems to be crimes, but which, according to generally recognised principles, could be considered as normal and lawful trade union activities.e) The Committee requests the Government to supply, as soon as possible, its observations on the most recent allegations, namely the death of four persons during demonstrations on  and  November , the arrest of Rodemil Aranda, leader of the Trade Union of the Caletones mines, the dismissal of trade union leaders in the port and health care sectors (Manuel Jerez Alvarado and Ricardo Vacarezza), the cancellation of the Copper Workers' Confederation elections and the confiscation of its assets.
.In their respective communications of  and  February , the WFTU and the ICFTU describe the measures taken against the Copper Workers' Confederation (CTC).
.The WFTU states that the Government ordered the closing of the records centre of the CTC, an organisation with over , members. According to the WFTU, other measures taken by the authorities were intended to prevent the CTC president, Rodolfo Seguel, as well as other officials from exercising their trade union functions and using the Confederation's premises and funds. According to the WFTU, the Government claims that these officials may no longer",1,1984,Chile
215,"hold trade union office since they are no longer employed in the mining industry, having been dismissed in  following a strike they had organised to protest against the deterioration in the standard of living of copper miners.
.According to the ICFTU, the measures taken by the Government have resulted in the immobilisation of the CTC following the court action barring its leaders from entering into contracts, performing administrative acts, holding meetings and making statements. With its communication, the ICFTU encloses a technical report prepared by a CTC legal adviser describing a number of summary measures taken by the th Civil Court of Santiago, at the request of the Labour Directorate. Such measures:- forbid the present executive of the CTC from entering into contracts or performing administrative acts and any other operations involving all or part of the property and assets of the CTC;- advise financial and banking institutions throughout the country to refrain from opening current or savings accounts and from paying cheques or making payments on behalf of the CTC;- advise the public as well as public and private enterprises to refrain from entering into legal agreements with the present executive of the CTC;- advise the National Copper Undertaking not to accept or consider any demand, claim or resolution presented by the present executive of the CTC;- forbid this executive from convening or holding trade union meetings, or participating in such meetings on behalf of the CTC;- likewise, forbid the executive from claiming to represent the CTC in any public or private meeting, national or international forums, meetings of other associations, publication or in any print, radio or television interview;- forbid the executive from removing from the CTC headquarters any document having a direct or indirect bearing on the Confederation's activities. For such purpose, seals will be affixed to all premises where such documentation is kept.
.According to CTC's legal adviser, the CTC's activities have been brought to a standstill as a result of a judgement that is wide open to criticism for the following reasons: the use of civil proceedings, the existence of a legal irregularity in the Labour Directorate's request, the fact that the court action exceeds the competence of the Labour Directorate, the recourse to summary proceedings, the absence of any guarantee or bond furnished by the complainant, as required by law, and the lack of proportion between the effect of the measures resulting from the judgement and the legal interest protected.
.In its communications of  and  March , the ICFTU alleges that on  February , Sergio Troncoso and Reinaldo Alvarez, President and Treasurer respectively of the Confederation of Building Workers were arrested, imprisoned and charged because the organisation's executive council had addressed a letter to the third chamber of the Supreme Court, protesting against the court's decision to leave the alleged killers of a teachers' union official at large. According to the ICFTU, these officials are liable to  days' to five years' imprisonment.
.In its communication of  March , the Dockers' Union No.  of San Antonio alleges that an October  strike in the maritime sector was followed by repressive action against  workers of loading and unloading enterprises who have not been able to find work for the past five months. The Agunsa enterprise struck from its lists eight workers it considered dangerous to its interests. The COSEPORT agency notified the SIRMAPORT trade union that it would no longer hire workers belonging to the organisation unless three of its present leaders were dismissed from their posts. The workers then requested the resignation of these leaders, replacing them by persons who enjoy the employer's absolute confidence. The former leaders are now unemployed. Moreover, the President of the SIRMAPORT union, Carlos Carrasco, has been unable to find work for five months, since all enterprises have refused his requests for employment on the grounds of his having been a trade union leader. Such is also the case with  members of the Dockers' Union No.  of San Antonio, whose President and Secretary had been accused of being ""union agitators"".
.In its communication of  April , the ICFTU reports that Juan Bustos Araneda, an official of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers (CDT), was abducted by armed civilians on  March. The ICFTU alleges that during his detention, Mr. Bustos suffered physical and psychological mistreatment and was questioned on the political and trade union activities of the CDT officials. He was found on  March in the Concepcion neighbourhood, in poor health and showing evidence of beatings and burn marks.
.In its communication of  April , the ICFTU alleges that on  April heavily armed police forces surrounded the MADECO trade union offices to prevent the holding of the first national conference called by the National Workers'Association.
.In its communication of  April , the Trades Union International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that by means of Decree No.  of  November , published on  March , the Government transferred the assets of seven trade union organisations that had been declared illegal in October , including the National Textile Federation, to a state body, the Training and Employment Service.
.In its communication of  May l, the ICFTU reports that the  May celebration organised by the CNT was banned and that the police and the military had opened fire on the demonstrators. According to the ICFTU, l were injued and  people were arrested, among them Manuel Bustos (later released), Jorge Millan and Lucia Sandoral of the CNT. In addition, the offices of the CNT and its affiliates were searched. For its part, the WCOTP alleges that armed police entered the premises of the Professional Association of Chilean Teachers (AGECH) in which May Day was being celebrated; furniture, machinery and documents were destroyed and  persons were arrested. Nineteen people, including Luis Gutirrez and Pavlisa Mora Drago (members of the AGECH Executive Committee) are still in detention.
.In its various communications, the Government furnished its observations on several allegations pending in this case: the charges laid against trade union leaders, the arrest of Rodemil Aranda Flores, the dismissal of Manuel Jerez Alvarado, the measures taken following the elections held within the Copper Workers' Confederation and the charges brought against the leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers.
.As regards the accusations levelled against the  trade union leaders following the protest day on  September l, the Government indicates that the case is at the stage of preparatory examination. All the accused are at present free.
.On the subject of the measures taken against trade union leaders in the port sector, the Government states that no charges have been preferred against these persons. It explains that fines imposed for offences against public order correspond exactly to the amount paid to be released on bail. The Government recalls that the bail was in this case paid by the Ministry of Labour.
.As regards the arrest of Rodemil Aranda Flores, the Government states in its communications of  March and  May  that this person is not an employee of the El Teniente Division of the National Copper Undertaking. He was arrested on  December  for having violated the Arms and Explosives Control Act, and more specifically, for the unlawful possession of explosives. This person is currently being held in the correctional centre of Rancagua. His application for release on bail was agreed on two occasions by the Military Prosecutor, but the Court Martial in both cases cancelled the decision.
.As regards the dismissal of Manuel Jerez Alvarado, the Government states that on  April  this person signed a contract for work as a deep-sea fisherman with the ""Viento Sur"" fishing enterprise. On  July , Jerez Alvarado was elected trade union leader while the workers were lawfully on strike, although he was not a member of the union. He joined the union shortly after having been elected as a leader. The enterprise was not notified of his appointment until  August . On  August , the enterprise informed the maritime authorities and the labour inspectorate that this worker had insulted and threatened physical assault against the captain of the vessel on which he was employed. On  August , the enterprise terminated Jerez Alvarado's work contract. On  September , he filed an appeal against unjustified dismissal before the Second Civil Court of Talcahuano. The parties did not reach agreement and the enterprise has requested the court to authorise the dismissal.
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of Mr. Ricardo Vacarezza, the Government indicates that the health services are autonomous and may engage personnel and terminate their employment in accordance with the law. This individual was a surgeon in the employ of the Eastern Metropolitan Health Service for  hours a week, under a contract for a limited period which expired on l December l. According to the Government, there was no arbitrary dismissal involved on the part of those in authority, but simply the coming to an end of a fixed",-1,1984,Chile
216,"term contract.
.As regards the measures taken following the elections within the Copper Workers' Confederation, the Government explains that the Labour Directorate, acting on the authority granted to it by the law (section  of Decree No.  of ), requested the th Chamber of the Santiago Civil Court to issue a series of injunctions. The judge handling the case issued a number of injunctions with a view to protecting the Confederation's assets, as well as those of its member unions, as well as the validity of the act and contracts of the organisation's executive. Therefore, the Government concludes, the measures in question are not administrative but judicial in nature.
.The Government states that the adoption of such measures is justified in view of the violations of current labour legislation. Thus, the Government states that by a resolution dated  November , the Labour Directorate declared five officials of the No.  works union of the El Salvador Division of CODELCO to be legally incompetent to exercise trade union functions, since they had been dismissed by the enterprise in June . Four union officials of the No.  works union of the El Salvador Division of CODELCO were likewise declared legally incompetent on the same grounds. The appeals filed by these persons were rejected by the Supreme Court on  December , on the grounds that they were no longer members of the enterprise or of the union, conditions which, according to trade union law and union regulations, are required of persons holding office. Following the Supreme Court's decision, the persons who had received the next highest number of votes after those ruled ineligible were appointed to occupy the vacant positions as union leaders. Pursuant to trade union legislation, these persons should have been admitted to the Copper Workers' Confederation assembly as elected leaders of a member union: however, they were not allowed to participate in the Confederation's congress.
.On  January , the Copper Workers' Confederation elected a new executive, without permitting these lawfully appointed officials to participate in the voting. On the contrary, it was the former officials who had been declared legally incompetent who participated in the elections. According to the Government, these constituted grounds for the election to be declared null and void in a court of law.
.Pursuant to section  of the by-laws of the Copper Workers' Confederation, its officials are elected by the executives of its member unions. Thus, the Confederation's by-laws were infringed. Such was also the case in connection with Rodolfo Seguel, who was elected President of the Confederation, despite the fact that he is legally incompetent to hold the post, having been dismissed by the CODELCO enterprise.
.Lastly, the Government states that four of the persons elected to the national executive council of the Copper Workers' Confederation (Rodolfo Seguel, Manuel Rodriguez, Sergio Barriga and Ral Montecinos) were not officials of member organisations, in violation of the organisation's by-laws and the law.
.In summary, the Government concludes that the elections were tainted by a threefold infraction of current legislation and union by-laws; in the first place, persons not employed in the enterprise, and therefore declared incompetent to hold office, were allowed to vote; secondly, the lawful officials of member unions were not allowed to vote; and lastly, persons who were neither union officials nor workers in the enterprise were elected.
.The Government adds that it is not true that these elections were void because their nullity must be declared by the courts, and the elections appear as valid until such nullity has been pronounced. Nor is it true that the Confederation's funds, accounts and assets were confiscated. The judge merely issued certain injunctions in accordance with the Civil Procedure Code. Furthermore, certain of these injunctions were rescinded by a decision of the First Chamber of the Santiago Court of Appeals, following an appeal filed by the Confederation's attorneys. This enabled the Confederation to meet its payroll and make other urgent payments.
.Furthermore, Luis Alamos, official of the No.  company union of the El Salvador Division of the CODELCO enterprise filed a complaint before the th Chamber of the Santiago Civil Court against Rodolfo Seguel and the Copper Workers' Confederation alleging that he was not allowed to participate in or vote at the Confederation's congress, in violation of the by-laws and the law.
.As regards the charges against two officials of the Confederation of Building Workers, the Government explains that towards the end of January  the executive of this Confederation sent a letter to the judges of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, following a sentence passed by this chamber in a criminal matter. The Court examined the letter in plenary session and found that it slandered the judges. Consequently, it requested the Santiago Court of Appeal to institute proceedings for contempt of court, pursuant to sections  and  of the Penal Code. The judge responsible for investigating this matter ordered the arrest and indictment of Sergio Troncoso Cisternas and Reinaldo Alvarez, on the grounds that an offence had been committed and that the evidence indicated that these two persons had participated in the offence either as authors or accessories. An appeal filed by the defence against the indictment was rejected by the First Chamber of the Court of Appeal, but the accused were nevertheless released on bail. The Government stresses that it did not intervene in these proceedings since they were initiated at the request of the Supreme Court itself.
.Lastly, the Government makes a general statement in its communication of  May l on the subject of the concepts of demonstrations of protest and strikes to which the Committee had referred in its previous report. The Government is of the view that it is not possible to characterise as strikes demonstrations in public thoroughfares which paralyse all activities. It reaffirms that protests involving violence are not designed to seek solutions to questions of economic and social policy but to destablise Government by rendering the country ungovernable.
.Following the Committee's last examination of the case at its February  meeting, the allegations still pending concerned the indictment of trade union leaders following a Protest Day held in September , and of officials of the port sector organisations for dis turbances on the public thoroughfare; the death of four persons during the demonstrations of  and  November ; the arrest of Rodemil Aranda, an official of the Industrial Union of the Caletones mines; the dismissal of trade union leaders in the port and health care sectors, and lastly, measures taken following the elections of the Copper Workers' Confederation. Since then, new allegations have been presented concerning the indictment of two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers, the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in the docks sector, the arrest of an official of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers, the intervention of law enforcement agents to prevent the holding of a national trade union conference, the transfer to a state body of the assets of organisations declared to be in violation of the law, and the numerous arrests and searches of trade union premises at the time of the  May celebrations.
.The Committee notes that the proceedings against  trade union leaders following the Protest Day of September , and against the officials of port sector organisations for disturbances on the public thoroughfare are at the stage of preparatory examination. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the current trials and their outcome, as soon as the judgements are handed down. As regards trade union leaders in the port sector, the Committee notes that there are no charges against them.
.The Committee again requests the Government to supply information on the death of four persons during the demonstrations of  and  November . In particular, it requests the Government to indicate whether an independent investigation has been carried out into this matter.
.As regards the arrest of Rodemil Aranda, the Committee notes that he was arrested and tried for the possession of arms and explosives. The Government also furnished detailed information on the types of explosives found at Mr. Aranda's home. Since it considers that the charges against Mr. Aranda cannot be considered to have any relation whatsoever to trade union activities, the Committee is of the view that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the dismissal of Manuel Jerez, an official of the Inter-enterprise Ports Union of the province of Concepcin, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this person was dismissed for having insulted and threatened physical assault against a superior. The Committee notes that the matter appears still to be before the courts. The Committee therefore requests the Government to furnish information on developments in the proceedings. As regards the dismissal of Ricardo Vacarezza, President of the Metropolitan Medical School, the Committee notes that this person's contract expired on l December l.
.As regards the measures taken following the elections held within the Copper Workers' Confederation, the Committee notes that, according to the Government,",0,1984,Chile
217,"there have been three infractions of the legislation and by-laws: the participation in the voting by persons not qualified to vote since they were neither workers in the enterprise nor officials of member trade unions; the exclusion from the voting of legally appointed officials of member trade unions, and the election of persons legally incompetent to hold office as trade union leaders.
.The Committee notes that the central issue in this matter arises from the obligation imposed by Chilean trade union legislation that requires elected trade union officials to be workers in the enterprise (section  of Legislative Decree No.  of June ). In this connection, it has always been the Committee's opinion, in particular in a case concerning Chile (see th Report, Case No. , para. ), that legal provisions that require all trade union leaders to belong to the occupation or the enterprise in which the organisation is active may endanger the exercise of trade union rights since, as shown by the case in point, the dismissal of a worker who holds a trade union office may bar him from office, undermine the organisation's freedom of action and the workers' right to elect their representatives freely, and even give the employer the opportunity to interfere. The Committee must recall moreover that it has had occasion in the past to examine allegations concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders by the CODELCO enterprise. (In particular, see th, rd, th and th Reports, Case No. .) At that time, the Committee considered that there was ample evidence that these dismissals were motivated by anti-trade union sentiment, and that Rodolfo Seguel, in particular, had been the subject of serious anti-trade union discrimination. (See th Report, paras.  and .) In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the disqualification of trade union leaders elected at the most recent congress of the Copper Workers' Confederation constitutes a serious violation of the right of organisations to elect their representatives freely. The Committee also considers that in order to ensure that this right is respected, the Government should amend the trade union legislation in order to allow persons who have previously worked in the occupation or enterprise in question to stand for election and to lift the requirements concerning membership of the occupation or the enterprise for a reasonable percentage of the trade union leaders.
.As regards the indictment of two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers, the Committee notes that judicial proceedings for slander and contempt of court were initiated, not at the Government's request, but pursuant to a decision of the Supreme Court meeting in plenary session. The Committee notes that the letter sent by the executive council of the Confederation of Building Workers to the Supreme Court criticised a court decision handed down in connection with criminal proceedings relative to the killing of trade unionists. Lacking specific information on the content of the letter in question, the Committee is unable to address the matter fully. However, in the Committee's opinion, trade union organisations are perfectly within their rights in expressing themselves on matters of this nature. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that in expressing their opinions, trade unions must respect the limits of propriety and refrain from using insulting language. The Committee requests the Government to transmit the text of the letter sent by the Confederation to the Supreme Court and to keep it informed on developments in the proceedings against the two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the latest allegations in this case,namely, the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in the docks sector; the arrest of Juan Bustos Araneva, an official of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers; the intervention of law enforcement agents to prevent the holding of a national trade union conference; the transfer to a state body of the assets of organisations declared to be illegal, the numerous arrests and searches of trade union premises at the time of the  May celebrations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) Regarding the charges against  trade union leaders following the Protest Day held in September , the Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the current trials and their outcome, as soon as the judgements are handed down.b) The Committee also once again requests the Government to furnish information on the death of four persons during the demonstrations of  and  November .c) Concerning the arrest of Rodemil Aranda, the Committee notes that none of the charges is related to trade union activities, and therefore considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.d) Concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders, the Committee requests the Government to furnish information on developments in the current proceedings involving Manuel Jerez, trade union leader of the port sector.e) Concerning the measures taken following the elections within the Copper Workers' Confederation, the Committee considers that the disqualification of trade union leaders elected at the most recent congress of the Confederation constitutes a serious violation of the right of an organisation to elect its representatives freely. The Committee considers that the Government should amend the trade union legislation in order to authorise persons who have previously worked in the occupation or in the enterprise in question to stand for election, and to lift the requirements of membership of the occupation or the enterprise for a reasonable percentage of the organisation's leaders.f) Concerning the indictments against two leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers, the Committee considers that the expression of an opinion by a trade union organisation concerning a court decision relative to the killing of trade union members, does in fact constitute a legitimate trade union activity. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that in expressing their opinions trade union organisations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language. The Committee requests the Government to transmit the text of the letter sent by the Confederation of Building Workers to the Supreme Court and to keep it informed of the developments in the proceedings against the two leaders of this Confederation.g) The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the most recent allegations presented in this case, namely, the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in the docks sector; the arrest of Juan Bustos Araneva, an official of the Democratic Central Organisation of Workers; the intervention of law enforcement agents to prevent the holding of a national trade union conference, the transfer to a state body of the assets of organisations declared to be illegal, and the numerous arrests and searches of trade union premises at the time of the  May celebrations.
.The Committee examined this case at its February, May and November  meetings, when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras.  to ; th Report, paras.  to ; and st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th, th and lst Sessions respectively (February-March, May and November ).)
.Since then, the ILO has received the following communications from the complainants: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  October and  November,  December  and  February ; National Federation of Trade Unions of Crews and Similar Branches of Chile:  October ; Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal Industry:  November ; World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  November ; World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  November ,  and  January ; World Federation of Teachers' Unions (FISE):  December . The Government, for its part, sent its observations in communications of  and  November ,  and  December  and ,  January and  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complaints presented in the present case concerned a number of events that have taken place in Chile since September . The allegations referred to the intervention of the forces of order on the occasion of the Protest Day held on  September , which is said to have resulted in the death of ten persons, many injuries and over , arrests. The complainants referred in particular to the case of Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros who, they said, had been arrested and tortured and whose body had subsequently been found. In this connection, the Government indicated that inquiries were being carried out by the competent criminal courts.
.It appeared, in the light of the allegations made, that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations (in particular the Confederation of Building Workers, the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) and the Chilectra Trade Union) had been attacked by the police and that material had been destroyed, documentation confiscated and trade unionists arrested. The",-1,1984,Chile
218,"Government denied that it had given orders for the trade union premises in question to be searched. Furthermore, on the day following the attack on the AGECH premises, Messrs. Manuel Guerrero, President of the Metropolitan Sector of this organisation, and Jos Manuel Parada, an official of the Vicariate of Solidarity, were kidnapped in the street. Their bodies were subsequently found horribly mutilated. The Government stated that a judicial inquiry had been opened.
.The complainants also referred to numerous arrests and the banishment of trade unionists. According to the Government, some of these trade unionists had not been arrested, others had been released and the reasons for the banishment were not related to trade union activities. More recent allegations mention the indictment and provisional arrests of trade union leaders following the Protest Day held on  September .
.The Committee also had before it allegations concerning infringements of the exercise of the right of assembly, in particular measures taken against a works union of the National Copper Corporation.
.Finally, it was alleged that trade union leaders had been dismissed in the teaching, ports and mining sectors.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body approved the following conclusions of the Committee:a) The Committee notes that, since its last examination of this case, several matters which have been the subject of allegations before the Committee have not been dealt with by the administrative authorities, but have been placed before the judiciary.b) As regards the inquiries carried out into the death of Messrs. Aguirre, Parada, Guerrero and Natina, the Committee notes that proceedings are still at the investigatory stage. While observing the excessive duration of these investigations, it expresses the firm hope that these inquiries will be concluded rapidly and will result in the determination of responsibilities so that the guilty parties can be punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in these matters.c) As regards the attacks against trade union premises, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the forces of order did not enter these premises. The Committee stresses the importance of protecting trade union premises. It urges the Government to initiate judicial inquiries into the matter so that the responsible parties may be identified as soon as possible and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.d) As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee notes that the persons mentioned in the Annex to its previous report have regained their freedom of movement. It observes, however, that despite the lifting of the state of siege, several allegations refer to new arrests and banishments concerning which the Government has supplied certain information. The Committee requests the Government, with a view to restoring social peace and normal trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to end the banishments as soon as possible. It also asks the Government to keep it informed of all steps taken to this end.e) As regards the indictment and preventive detention of trade union leaders, the Committee points out that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no subsequent charges are brought may involve restrictions on freedom of association. The Government should take measures to ensure that the authorities concerned receive appropriate instructions to prevent the dangers involved for trade union activities by unjustified measures of arrest. The Committee reminds the Government that trade union organisations should be able to have recourse to protest strikes with a view to defending the economic and social interests of their members. It requests the Government to supply information on the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way against those responsible for and the organisers of the day of protest held on  September .f) As regards the right of assembly, the Committee recalls in general that freedom of trade union assembly is one of the fundamental aspects of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which is likely to limit this right or impede its lawful exercise.g) As regards the dismissals of trade union leaders, the Committee points out that the dismissal of a trade union leader is liable, by reason of the fact that dismissal causes him to lose his status as a trade union officer, to infringe the freedom of association of his organisation and its right to elect its representatives in full freedom and may even leave the way open for acts of interference by the employer. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations concerning the dismissals of trade union leaders in the teaching and port sectors.
.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU gives details of the measures taken by the Government following the Protest Day of  September . It explains that, on the following day, the Government, acting through legal counsel of the Ministry of the Interior, lodged complaints against many trade union leaders on presumption of their responsibility in the violent acts which took place during the protest. According to the ICFTU, there were no grounds for the legal proceedings which resulted. It points out that the persons concerned included Sergio Troncoso, who had been banished to Melinka, Humberto Arcos, who was undergoing medical treatment in France, and Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, who was at that time in Magallanes taking part in a collective bargaining session. In the view of the ICFTU, this proves that the aim was not to arrive at the truth and to seek justice, but merely to break up trade union organisations by immobilising their leaders and keeping them out of the way.
.The complaint lodged against  trade union leaders was rejected in the first instance, continues the ICFTU. The Ministry of the Interior then lodged an appeal with the Sixth Chamber of the Court of Appeal. On  September the Court decided to charge Messrs. Rodolfo Seguel and Manuel Bustos for contravention of the State Security Act (participation in meetings for the purpose of conspiring to destabilise the legally constituted Government, holding of unauthorised demonstrations on the public thoroughfare, attempts to paralyse national activities). The ICFTU states that the Court refused to hear the counsel for the defence on the pretext that they were not parties in the case. On  September  many trade union leaders were heard by the courts, arrested and later charged.
.In their communications of  November , the ICFTU and the WFTU once again draw attention to the situation of Rodolfo Seguel, Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez, Eduardo Valencia, Mario Araneda and Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, still under arrest. The ICFTU also mentions the arrest on  October  of Adrin Fuentes, Acting President of the Confederation of Building Workers, and Mara Rozas, President of the Women's Department of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body. The WCOTP refers to the arrest of the latter in its communication of  November .
.In its communication of  October , the National Federation of Trade Unions of Crews and Similar Branches of Chile reports that, on  August , a leader of the Inter-Enterprise Port Workers' Union of the Province of Concepcin, Mr. Manuel Jerez Alvarado, was summoned to attend the Maritime Governor's Office in Talcahuano the next day to answer an accusation made by the ""Viento Sur"" Fishery Company regarding his differences with the management due to his defence of certain workers. The Governor's Office withdrew his work booklet, and the undertaking dismissed him three days afterwards, requesting the courts to waive his trade union immunity. Moreover, the Governor's Office fined him about , pesos, a sum which he is unable to pay.
.The Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal Industry, in its communication of  November , refers to the arrest of two leaders of the Confederation of Workers in the Metal Industry (CONSTRAMET), Jos Ramn Avello Soto and Jos Enrique Nuez Estrella, on  August  and their subsequent banishment to the island of Melinka. It also mentions the arrest, on  September , of another official, Ana Mara Miranda Urbina, Director of the Cultural Department of CONSTRAMET.
.In its communication of  December , the ICFTU alleges that, on  November , a number of trade union leaders in the maritime and port sector were arrested by the police while protesting against the Government's economic and social policy. The persons named are Sergio Aguirre, an official of the San Antonio Port Workers' Union; Salatier Snchez, President of the CONGEMAR Union; Walter Astorga, a seamen's leader from the bay of San Antonio; Vctor Guerra, an official of the CONGEMAR Union; Hctor Aguayo, General Secretary of the Maritime Confederation of Chile (COMACH); Luis Salas, President of COMACH; Heriberto Jara, President of Dockers' Union No.  of Valparaiso; Mauricio Riquelme and Pedro Morales, officials of COMACH. These persons and nine other trade unionists are now alleged to be in custody at the First Police Commissariat of Santiago. The ICFTU points out that the CONGEMAR Union and COMACH have been on strike for a month.
.The FISE, in its communication of  December , mentions the arrest of Father",1,1984,Chile
219,"Renato Hevia, director of the review Mensaje and member of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile.
.In its communication of  January , the WFTU estimates that , persons were arrested and  killed in . In addition,  trade union activists are said to have been banished to other parts of the country by government decision. Since in its view the Government is continuing to ignore the recommendations of the Committee and the Governing Body, the WFTU requests that a commission be sent to Chile.
.In its communication of  January , the WFTU alleges that on  and  November  during a protest demonstration organised in solidarity with the arrested trade unionists, four persons were killed. According to witnesses, three of them were killed by military personnel and one by civilians who fired shots from a van. In addition, on these days,  persons were banished to the north of Chile.
.The WFTU also mentions the case of three teachers of the No.  School ""Puerto Navarino"", who were dismissed for having protested against being paid with worthless cheques.
.The WFTU refers to the arrest on  December  at Rancagua of Rodermil Aranda Flores, leader of the Trade Union of the Caletones Mines. His house was searched and a poster, a cassette and a publication were seized. He was, however, accused of stocking abundant material for subversive activities, such as explosives and paramilitary type equipment.
.In addition, the WFTU alleges the dismissal of the President of the Metropolitan Medical College, Dr. Ricardo Vacarezza, as a reprisal for his stance against the Government's health policy. A solidarity meeting organised by doctors was allegedly prohibited.
.In its communication of  February , the ICFTU alleges that, on  January  following a request from the Ministry of Labour, a Santiago court annulled the elections which had been held during the last congress of the Copper Workers' Confederation in January . In addition, the elected officers (including Rodolfo Seguel, re-elected President by a majority vote) can neither express opinions nor represent their union on pain of imprisonment. On  January, Labour Ministry officials, supported by the police, confiscated the Confederation's assets and froze its bank accounts, thus preventing the Confederation's  employees from being paid.
.It appears from the various replies of the Government that, after the violent events of ,  and  September , the Ministry of the Interior lodged a complaint with the ordinary courts to determine who was responsible for instigating, fomenting or taking part in the protest. The Government states that ten persons lost their lives during those days, that about  were injured, and that  policemen were seriously injured. The acts of violence and the ransacking of various commercial establishments caused  million pesos' worth of damages, and many public places were also damaged.
.The Court of Santiago appointed Mr. Sergio Valenzuela Patio as magistrate to examine the complaints of contravention of sections (c),  i)and () of the State Security Act No. , adopted in . These sections refer to meetings with a view to overthrowing the Government or conspiring to destabilise it; the holding of unauthorised demonstrations on the public thoroughfare; and the unlawful interruption or collective suspension of, or strikes in, public services, services essential to the public, production activities, transport or commerce which provoke disturbances of the peace, disruptions in services essential to the public or damage to vital industries.
.The examining magistrate ordered the arrest of, and brought charges against,  persons whom he considered to bear the responsibility for the offences under the State Security Act. This decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court following appeals presented by the defendants. The magistrate released eight of the accused on bail (Rodolfo Seguel, Luis Campos, Jos Figueroa, Arturo Martnez, Jorge Pavez, Samuel Bello, Carlos Poblete and Jos Rivera). Only four of the accused were denied release on bail by the examining magistrate: Manuel Bustos, Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, Mario Araneda and Eduardo Valencia, against whom proceedings were under way. Following an uprising in the Santiago Penitentiary, the prisoners were transferred to an establishment named Capuchinos, which is more comfortable and where security is stricter. All the releases on bail were confirmed by the Court of Appeal with the exception of those of Rodolfo Seguel and Arturo Martnez.
.Following further appeals presented by their counsel, Rodolfo Seguel, Eduardo Valencia and Arturo Martnez were released on bail on  November . Subsequently, on  December , the Court of Appeal unanimously decided to dismiss the charges against Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, since his participation in the offences was not proven. He was released the same day. The Court also decided to release Mario Araneda provisionally, but maintained the charges against him. The Court unanimously refused to dismiss the charges against Manuel Bustos and to release him provisionally. His counsel stated that he intended to reapply for his release on bail in January . In this connection, the Government states that, in accordance with Chilean criminal procedure, provisional release may be requested as often as necessary before an individual is finally released.
.Finally, on  December , the Court of Appeal unanimously decided to release Manuel Bustos on bail, and he left prison on the same day.
.As the regards the events of ,  and  September  which gave rise to the charges, the Government remarks that there were no strikes in the public service on those days. It reaffirms that the arrested trade unionists were released by decision of the examining magistrate and the Court of Appeal and that the judges and courts are independent. Consequently, the executive cannot give any instruction regarding the manner in which the law is to be applied. As regards the strikes, the Government recalls that Legislative Decree No.  of  to lay down rules for collective bargaining and strikes is fully applied in the country. Thus, between August  and June , there were  strikes, involving , workers and representing , lost workdays. It is thus clear, according to the Government, that workers' organisations have made use of strike action to defend the economic and social interests of their members. The Government also furnishes detailed statistics on collective agreements concluded between employers and workers.
.As regards the allegation relating to the arrest of Father Renato Hevia, the Government states that the Ministry of the Interior has requested the appointment of a magistrate to investigate the articles published in the Catholic review Mensaje managed by the person concerned. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal of Santiago charged Father Hevia with insulting the President of the Republic and ordered him to be placed in preventive custody. The examining magistrate, following his investigations, concluded that there was insufficient evidence and provisionally dismissed the case, releasing the accused on bail. Finally, the Government states that there is no evidence that Father Hevia is a trade union official or member, or that he is a member of the AGECH. In the Government's view, this proves yet again that freedom of association bodies are being used for the sole purpose of embarrassing a member State.
.As regards the arrest of trade union officials in the port sector, the Government points out that these persons were arrested for having caused disturbances on the public thoroughfare on  November , preventing movements of pedestrians and vehicles. A trade union official asked the Minister of Labour to intervene to obtain their release. The Minister obtained their release against a bail of  pesos (about US$) for each of them and paid this sum himself.
.In connection with this case, the Government recalls that the offices of the ILO were illegally occupied by five persons for five days. It considers that the occupation of offices, the taking of hostages and illegal confinement for the purpose of attracting attention is an inadmissible way of exerting pressure, particularly when there are appropriate channels for dealing with freedom of association matters.
.As regards the strike of maritime and port workers in the ports of Valparaso and San Antonio, the Government explains that the organisation of work in this sector was altered by Act No.  in September . According to the Government, this Act put an end to practices that were highly unfavourable to the workers, such as the hiring out of work permits, under which the worker had to pay half of the remuneration he received to the owner of the workbook or labour permit. This Act was therefore widely supported by the workers. With a view to improving the new system, tripartite commissions were set up and their studies resulted in a Bill to introduce major improvements in the fields of work and social welfare; this entered into force on  December . Finally, the Government states that no trade union leader in the maritime and port sector is under arrest and that work is proceeding normally in all the ports of the country.
.In its communication of  February , the Government provides information on the persons alleged to",0,1984,Chile
220,"have been banished or arrested (see Annex). As regards the banishments, the Government states generally that these measures - which cannot last longer than  days - were taken by virtue of the powers given to the Chief of State by the Constitution. The reasons behind these measures were participation by the persons concerned in clandestine partisan politics which had no relation to the trade union activities they allegedly carried out.
.As regards the allegations of dismissals in the teaching sector, the Government indicates that the dismissals in the Castro municipality were necessary for the efficient operation of the service. In all cases, cheques covering compensation and salary adjustments were given to those concerned by the Labour Inspectorate and corresponding receipts were signed. As for Mr. Juan Ruz Campos, dismissed in the Puerto Montt Municipality, the Government states that he appealed on the grounds of unjustified dismissal to the nd Civil Court at Puerto Montt. On  April  the court confirmed the dismissal which had been based on violation of the State Security Act. The judgement is now executory.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Sergio Aguirre of the Chile Port Company, the Government states that the employer invoked the efficient functioning of the service and a reorganisation. According to the Government it was therefore not an anti-union discriminatory measure.
.The Committee notes that, since its last meeting in November , the Government has supplied information on further developments in the judicial proceedings against the organisers of the Protest Day of  September . It appears from this information that  of the  trade union officials initially arrested and charged have been released on bail and that the charge against one of them (Jos Ruiz di Giorgio) has been dismissed. All the accused have therefore been released. The Committee notes that these charges were brought for contravention of the State Security Act, and in particular the provisions relating to the organisation of meetings aimed at overthrowing the Government, holding unauthorised public demonstrations and organising illegal strikes. In connection with the strikes, the Committee notes the statistics supplied by the Government on the organisation of such action since . It recalls, however, that under the provisions of the Chilean legislation relating to the calling of strikes (sections  to  of Legislative Decree No. ), a strike may be decided on only in connection with the renewal of collective agreements. These provisions also rule out the calling of strikes by federations and confederations. In this connection, the Committee must stress that that the prohibition on the calling of strikes by federations and confederations is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and that the occupational and economic interests which the workers defend by resorting to strikes do not merely concern better conditions of work or collective claims of an occupational nature but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social policy questions (see th Report, Case No.  (Peru), para. ; th Report, Case No.  (Upper Volta), para. ).
.In the present case, while noting that the accused have been released on bail, the Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the trials under way and on their results, once the judgements have been handed down.
.As regards the arrests of trade union leaders in the port sector during a demonstration, the Committee also notes that the persons concerned were released after the Minister of Labour stood bail for them. The Committee understands, however, that the charges against these persons have not been dropped. It therefore requests the Government to supply information on the judicial proceedings against them.
.As regards the arrest and banishment of other unionists, the Committee notes that, according to information supplied by the Government (see Annex), some of these persons were simply requested to undergo a control of their identity papers or to give evidence in the framework of the inquiry into the September  Protest Day. On the other hand, other persons were banished. The Government limits itself to indicating that these banishments were based on clandestine partisan political activities, and does not mention the concrete acts in question. The Committee observes once again that these banishments affect trade union leaders and therefore must have directly affected the functioning of the trade union organisations. It firmly requests the Government once again to take the necessary steps so that such measures, which do not provide for any judicial guarantees, are not taken again.
.The Committee also takes note of the information provided by the Government that the dismissals of trade unionists in the teaching and port sectors were based, in its opinion, on reasons connected with the functioning of services. In one case, however, the dismissal was justified because of violation of the State Security Act, although the precise acts giving rise to these violations were not supplied to the Committee. The Committee would, in general, express its concern over the fact that workers can lose their jobs after being arrested or sentenced for having committed acts which the national legislation deems to be crimes, but which, according to generally recognised principles, could be considered as normal and lawful trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has supplied no information on the most recent allegations in this case, namely the death of four persons during demonstrations on  and  November , the arrest of Rodemil Aranda, a leader of the Trade Union of the Caletones Mines and the dismissal of trade union leaders in the health and port sectors, Ricardo Vacarezza and Manuel Jerez Alvarado, respectively, the cancellation of the Copper Workers' Confederation elections and the confiscation of this organisation's assets. The Committee expresses the hope that this information will be transmitted as soon as possible.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) Regarding the arrests and charges made following the Protest Day on  September , the Committee notes that  of the  trade union officials who were initially arrested and charged have been released on bail and that the charge against one of them has been dismissed. While noting that the charges were brought on the basis of provisions relating to the organisation of demonstrations on the public thoroughfare and illegal strikes, the Committee stresses that the prohibition on the calling of strikes by federations and confederations is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. It recalls that the occupational and economic interests which the workers defend by resorting to strikes concern not only better conditions of work or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the search for solutions to economic and social policy questions. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the current trials and their outcome, as soon as judgements are handed down.b) Regarding the arrest of trade union officials in the port sector, the Committee notes that the persons concerned were released after the Minister of Labour stood bail for them. It requests the Government to supply information on developments in the proceedings initiated against them.c) Regarding the banishment of other trade unionists, the Committee firmly requests the Government once again to take the necessary steps to ensure that such measures, which do not provide for any judicial guarantees, are not taken again.d) Regarding the dismissal of trade union officials, the Committee notes that one trade unionist was dismissed for violation of the State Security Act and expresses its concern that workers can lose their jobs after being arrested or sentenced for having committed acts which the national legislation deems to be crimes, but which, according to generally recognised principles, could be considered as normal and lawful trade union activities.e) The Committee requests the Government to supply, as soon as possible, its observations on the most recent allegations, namely the death of four persons during demonstrations on  and  November , the arrest of Mr. Rodemil Aranda, leader of the Trade Union of the Caletones Mines, the dismissal of trade union leaders in the port and health sectors (Messrs. Manuel Jerez Alvarado and Ricardo Vacarezza), the cancellation of the Copper Workers' Confederation elections and the confiscation of its assets.
.The Committee examined this case at its February and May  meetings, when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras.  to  and th Report, paras.  to , approved respectively by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (February-March and May ).)
.Since then, the ILO has received the following communications from the complainants: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  May ,  and  July ,  and  August , , ,  and  September and  October ; National Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities:  May ; National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS):  May ; World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  May,  and  October ; the National Grouping of",-1,1984,Chile
221,"Workers:  June ; the World Confederation of Labour (WCL):  June  and  October ; World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  July ,  and  August ; Works Unions Nos.  and  of El Salvador and No.  of Sewell y Minas of the National Copper Corporation of Chile:  July ; Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal Industry:  September . The Government, for its part, furnished its observations in communications dated ,  and  August,  September and  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints presented in the present case concerned a number of events that had taken place in Chile since September . The allegations referred to the intervention of the forces of order on the occasion of the Protest Day held on  September , which is said to have resulted in the death of ten persons, many injuries and over , arrests. The complainants referred in particular to the case of Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, who, they said, had been arrested and tortured and whose body had been subsequently found. In this connection, the Government indicated that inquiries were being carried out by the competent criminal courts.
.It appeared, in the light of the allegations made, that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations (in particular the Confederation of Building Workers, the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) and the Chilectra trade union) had been attacked by the police and that material had been destroyed, documentation confiscated and trade unionists arrested. The Government denied that it had given orders for the trade union premises in question to be searched. Furthermore, on the day following the attack on the AGECH premises, Messrs. Manuel Guerrero, President of the metropolitan sector of this organisation and Jos Manuel Parada, an official of the Vicariat of Solidarity, were kidnapped in the street. Their bodies were subsequently found horribly mutilated. The Government stated that a judicial inquiry had been opened.
.The complainants also referred to numerous arrests and the banishment of trade unionists. According to the Government, some of these trade unionists had not been arrested, others had been released and the reasons for the banishments were not related to trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee was informed of allegations concerning infringements of the exercise of the right to hold meetings, in particular taken against a works union of the National Copper Corporation. The Government had not replied to this allegation.
.At its meeting of May-June , the Governing Body approved the following conclusions of the Committee:a) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the difficulties facing a large number of Chilean trade union organisations and their leaders. It considers that the Government should urgently take every measure necessary to put an end to this climate of violence; this implies that respect for the human rights essential for the development of trade union activities be guaranteed.(b) As regards the deaths which took place during the National Protest Day of  September , the Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the inquiry opened into this matter and on its eventual results.(c) As regards the death of Messrs. Aguirre, Guerrero and Parada, the Committee expresses the firm hope that the inquiries under way in these matters will lead to the rapid determination of responsibilities; it requests the Government to continue to supply information on these inquiries.(d) As regards the attacks on trade union premises, the Committee deplores the fact that such acts have again been committed against trade union organisations. It notes that the Government denies having ordered searches of these premises and requests the Government to order that inquiries be undertaken with a view to finding the perpetrators of these acts which call for severe measures by the authorities against those found responsible. It requests the Government to supply information on any inquiries which have been carried out in this regard.(e) As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, in particular, that some persons were not arrested and that others are free. It considers that the accumulation of these banishment measures considerably weakens trade union organisations by depriving them of their leaders and hindering their activities. It requests the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons - listed in the Annex - concerning whom it has not yet replied and on the concrete acts which were the basis for the measures taken against them.(f) As regards the obstacles to the right of assembly, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not lifted them. It requests the Government to supply its observations on the allegations presented by the Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation.
.In its communication of  May , the ICFTU refers to a letter which was sent to it on  May  by the Confederation of Copper Workers. The latter organisation alleges that on  April , the homes of several of the leaders of the El Salvador trade union were searched in Diego de Amalgro when these persons were attending the National Congress of the Confederation.
.On  May , a leader of the same trade union was summoned to the carabineers' headquarters of El Salvador. On the same day, several leaders of the Andean zone trade union were arrested and held for several hours for having organised an athletics competition in the streets of Villa Minera Andina to celebrate the st of May, despite the fact that they had been granted authorisation to hold the event.
.On  May , Mr. Ral Montecinos, leader of the Diego de Amalgro zone and national leader of the Confederation, was allegedly arrested and then transferred to the town of Copiap.
.The National Confederation of Worker' Trade Unions in Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities and the National Grouping of Workers allege, in their communications of  May and  June , that on  April  the headquarters of the Building Confederation of Building Workers were illegally searched by a group of ten individuals armed with machine guns and whose faces were covered with balaclavas. This search, which was carried out without any legal warrant, involved the use of violence. The trade union leaders present were harassed, attacked and beaten. Furniture was broken and property taken away, including training materials and the archives of the Confederation. Several trade union leaders were threatened with death if they continued to exercise their activities.
.Shortly later the same day, the complainant organisation alleges that officials of the carabineers appeared at the headquarters of the Confederation and interrogated the trade union leaders Figueroa Jorquera, Bustamante Garci and Alvarez, who were then taken to the police station and once again interrogated.
.Furthermore, according to the complainant organisation, during the months of March, April and May , several of its leaders were frequently followed, threatened or harassed. Since  April, carabineers have been controlling the entrance to the trade union headquarters and sometimes prevent trade union leaders and members from entering.
.Given these circumstances, the Confederation lodged complaints and appeals for protection with the courts. It appears from these court proceedings that the staff of the National Information Centre, the carabineers of Chile and the civil investigation department of the police did not participate in the search carried out in the premises of the Confederation and that no warrant had been issued for the arrest of trade union leaders.
.The complainant organisation adds that on  April , the Minister of the Interior brought legal proceedings against four of its leaders, namely, Sergio Troncoso, Jos E. Rivera, Jos Manuel Bustamante and Jos Figueroa, for having violated the State Security Act, and in support of the case presented the documentation which had been seized during the paramilitary operation of  April carried out against the trade union headquarters. According to the complainant organisation, the links between the authorities and the group in question are thus clearly proven.
.In its communication of  May , the CNS mentions the banishment of several trade union leaders (see Annex), some of whom have been allegedly interned in a camp, at Conchi, in the north of the country.
.The WCOTP also mentions, in its communication of  May , several instances of the banishment of trade unionists in the teaching profession (whose names had already been communicated to the Committee), as well as the dismissal of several members and leaders of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH): Alban Mancilla, Orlando Aguilar, Luis Maldonado, Carlos Trujillo, Nelson Torres, all of whom are leaders or former leaders of the Castro Community Council, as well as Juan Ruiz, President of the Provincial Council of Puerto Montt.
.In its communication of  July , the ICFTU mentions the situation of Siergo Aguirre, President of the Union of Port Workers of San Antonio, who was dismissed from the civil service",0,1984,Chile
222,"by a Supreme Decree after he had been banished.
.The ICFTU also refers to the proceedings brought against four leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers. During the proceedings, Manuel Bustos, President of the CNS, was called upon to give evidence and, during the interrogation by the examining magistrate, the latter ordered his arrest. He was taken to the former public prison and locked up in a cell without any light. For three days he was given no water or food. He was released following the unanimous decision of the Eighth Chamber of the Court of Appeal. Three days after the release of Manuel Bustos, the four leaders of the Confederation of Building Workers were released on bail.
.The National Grouping of Workers and the WCL also mention, in their communications of  and  June , the arrest of Manuel Bustos.
.In its communication of  July , the WFTU refers to the case of Pedro Aroya Daz Valdez, President of the Union of Professional and Technical Pilots, who was dismissed in  because of his trade union activities. Furthermore, his organisation has been virtually destroyed. All his attempts to be reinstated in his work have been unsuccessful.
.Works Unions Nos.  and  of El Salvador and No.  of Sewell y Minas of the National Copper Corporation as well as the ICFTU, in their communications of  July , refer to the dismissal of Rodolfo Seguel, President of the National Copper Confederation. This measure was endorsed by the Supreme Court following an appeal presented by Mr. Seguel. According to the complainants, the effective inexistence of any protection of trade union leaders prevents the exercise of trade union mandates and jeopardises the autonomy of the trade union movement. Subsequently, the WFTU and the ICFTU sent, in their communications of  and  August , the text of the judgement issued by the Supreme Court in this matter.
.In their communications dated  and  August , the WFTU and the ICFTU protest against the arrest of trade union leaders including Sergio Troncoso, President of the Confederation of Building Workers, and Juan Ponce who were subsequently banished to Melinka in the far south of the country.
.The ICFTU points out, in its telegram of  September , that a demonstration which had been called by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) on  September  was violently repressed. According to the ICFTU, ten persons were killed and hundreds were arrested. Charges were brought against several leaders of the CNT and, in particular, against Rodolfo Seguel, Manuel Bustos, Jos Ruiz di Giorgio and Sergio Troncoso. Subsequently, in communications dated  and  September and  October , the ICFTU and the WCL point out that following a decision by three judges of the Supreme Court, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Rodolfo Seguel and Manuel Bustos who were imprisoned. Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, President of the Union of Petroleum Workers, Maria Rozas and Mercedes Jerez, leaders of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH), have also been arrested. The Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal Industry also mentions the arrest and banishment of Claudio Gallardo, leader of the Confederation of Unions of Metallurgical Workers (CONSTRAMET). The WCOTP, for its part, alleges in its communication of  October  that four national leaders of the AGECH were arrested on  September. They are Jorge Paveg, President; Samuel Bello, Treasurer; Luis Campo Leal and Carlos Poblete Avile, members of the National Executive Committee.
.In its communication of  September  the ICFTU supplies further details concerning the measures taken by the authorities following the demonstration of  September. According to the ICFTU, the purpose of this demonstration was to demand a reply from the Government to the ""list of petitions and claims"" of the workers adopted in August by the National Assembly of Leaders of the National Grouping of Workers. The Government allegedly responded to this Day of Protest by the arrest of  leaders of student, trade union and political organisations, including  leaders of the National Grouping of Workers and l leaders of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile. Furthermore,  other persons were allegedly held in administrative detention for a period of O days. In the same way, more than OO persons were allegedly arrested throughout the country during demonstrations. They were brought before the local police courts and accused of having instigated acts of disorder on the public thoroughfare.
.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU states that Manuel Bustos, Rodolfo Seguel and Jos Ruiz di Giorgio are still being held in detention. Seven other trade union leaders have allegedly been arrested and taken to Santiago prison (see Annex). The WCOTP refers in its communication of  October  to the arrest of four AGECH leaders and states that, according to the organisers of the  September demonstration, acts of provocation had occurred. According to the WCOTP, it was observed that occupants of an unmarked car fired shots which apparently caused deaths and injuries.
.Before replying to the specific allegations made in the present case, the Government, in its communication of  September , makes some general comments on freedom of association in Chile. It mentions, in particular, the current provisions regarding the acquisition of legal personality, the drafting of constitutions, the right to elect leaders, dissolution through the courts, the establishment of federations and confederations, affiliation to international organisations, trade union law and employment as well as trade union autonomy. After an examination of these various provisions, the Government concludes that in its view the national legislation embodies a strict application of the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , although these instruments have not been ratified by Chile.
.As regards civil liberties, the Government points out that although it believes that the political situation of the country goes beyond the subjects which should be dealt with by the Committee of Freedom of Association, the political Constitution of the Republic was adopted in  by  per cent of the voters and that it establishes, after a period of transition, the full respect of the democratic system. The Government adds that because of experiences which have occurred in the country and the escalation in terrorism, which is affecting all the peoples of Latin America, the Constitution makes provision for exceptional measures to guarantee social peace in the country. These mechanisms include the state of seige when there is a situation of ""internal shock"" in the country. It was in virtue of this provision that the state of seige was proclaimed between  November  and  June . However, the Government points out that with a view to protecting freedom of association, Supreme Decree No.  was adopted; it establishes regulations concerning the right of assembly and does not require any authorisation, but simply an advance notice of five days, for the holding of meetings by organisations endowed with legal personality in their own premises.
.As regards the inquiry by a special judge into the disappearance and death of Mr. Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, the Government points out that the legal proceedings are at the investigatory stage. In accordance with the Code of Penal Procedure, in force since , this stage of the proceedings is carried out in secret.
.With regard to the inquiry into the death of Messrs. Jos Manuel Parada, Manuel Guerrero and Santiago Natina, the Government also points out that the legal proceedings are at the investigatory stage. The examining magistrate has indicted two former police officers on the charge of having ""falsified public documents"".
.With regard to the allegations concerning the attack against the premises of the National Democratic Development Project (PRODEN), the Government states, in its communication of  August , that this body is a public company set up in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code governing company contracts. The leaders of this company are former deputies of Congress and the premises which house its headquarters are not trade union premises. The police categorically reject the allegation that they entered these premises.
.As regards the events which occurred in the headquarters of the Confederation of Building Workers, the Government explains in its communication of  September  that on the day of the attack the carabineers of the Fourth Station went to the premises of the Confederation in order to investigate the offences committed. The carabineers found , political pamphlets of a subversive nature as well as abundant propaganda and material in support of doctrines which advocate the use of violence. The Minister of the Interior instructed the courts to carry out an inquiry and punish the guilty parties. Following this inquiry, the examining magistrate indicted Messrs. Troncoso, Figueroa, Rivera and Bustamante on charges of having infringed section (f) of the State Security Act (which punishes those persons who disseminate doctrines designed to destroy the republican and democratic form of the Government) and ordered their detention.
.During the inquiry, the magistrate called Mr. Manuel Bustos as a witness and subsequently ordered his arrest, after interrogation, as a",-1,1984,Chile
223,"preventive measure in accordance with the powers conferred on him by the Code of Penal Procedure. Following an appeal for protection by his counsel, Mr. Bustos was released on the instructions of the Appeal Court of Santiago. Furthermore, the examining magistrate accepted a request for bail by the four leaders of the Confederation. This measure was approved on  June  by the Appeal Court of Santiago. Subsequently, on  July , the examining magistrate ordered the dismissal of the charges against the accused, thus putting an end to the proceedings, since there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against certain persons. The matter is therefore closed.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrests made after a search was carried out of the premises of the Chilectra trade union, the Government explains that a clandestine meeting had been held on these premises of political parties which had been declared illegal because of their support of terrorism. The purpose of this meeting was to pay homage to the Socialist Party of Chile and its founder. The participants included persons from outside the Chilectra trade union and the Chilean electricity undertaking and had no relation, even of an indirect nature, with trade union activities. The persons arrested were released after their identity had been verified. Messrs. Victor Hugo Gac and Eugenio Madrid Salgado were banished to Chaiten for a period of three months and Mr. Manuel Dinamarca to Ciudad de Palena for the same period. At the present time, these persons are free to move throughout the country, since their banishment has terminated.
.As regards the events which occurred at Villa Minera Andina on  May , the Government points out that each year the workers of this town celebrate the labour day holiday by organising in particular a religious ceremony, a football championship and athletic events in the streets of the town. The Government adds that because of police regulations, prior authorisation must be requested to hold such events in the public thoroughfare. However, the athletic event was held in the streets without such authorisation. There was a traffic accident in which several persons were injured. The police officer who made the report arrested the person apparently responsible for the accident, Mr. Arturo Uribe, director of one of the organising trade unions. Other trade union leaders accompanied him to the police station. Subsequently, the Chief of Police ordered the immediate release of all persons detained. The Government states that another person mentioned by the complainants, Mr. Ral Montecinos, is free and that it has no information on the alleged searches carried out in the homes of trade union leaders.
.Furthermore, the Government provides information on the persons mentioned as having been arrested and banished in the Committee's th Report (see Annex). The Government points out that the banishments in question were ordered by virtue of the powers vested in Head of State by the Constitution during the state of siege. On  June  the state of siege which had been in force since  November  was lifted. Under the Constitution, the period of banishment may not exceed  days. The events which led to these measures were participation in clandestine activities of partisan politics which had no relation to trade union activities. At no moment, the Government points out, did it attempt to weaken the trade union movement by depriving it of its leaders or hindering its activities. In conclusion, on this point the Government believes that the information supplied shows that there has never been an atmosphere of violence against the trade unions. It does not share the opinion expressed in the conclusions of the Committee because the latter has generalised cases of an exceptional nature and has erroneously equated violent acts with trade union activities.
.As regards the allegations concerning the right of assembly, the Government reaffirms that during the state of siege, meetings of trade union organisations endowed with legal personality may take place in their own premises without prior authorisation, provided that an advance notice of five days is given to the office of the provincial governor. On  June  the state of siege was lifted and replaced by a state of emergency for a period of  days, because of the existence of internal danger to national security. The Directorate of the zone declared to be in a state of emergency in the metropolitan region and the Province of San Antonio passed a decree establishing that meetings of organisations endowed with legal personality, assemblies for the establishment of trade unions and federations, as well as meetings organised in the exercise of the rights of workers and of legally recognised trade unions do not require authorisation, provided that they are held in the premises of the organisation and that their exclusive purpose is to examine matters considered under the legislation relevant to their objectives.
.Concerning the allegation regarding the prohibition of a meeting of Works' Union No.  of CODELCO, El Salvador Division, the Government points out, in its communication of  August , that reasons of internal security obliged the authorities to suspend the right of assembly during these days. This exceptional situation did in no way paralyse trade union activity since during this period eight trade union meetings were held in the second fortnight of March by the trade unions of the El Salvador Division as well as elections by the complainant organisation on  July . An appeal for protection was lodged with the Appeal Court of Copiap and was rejected.
.As regards the situation of Mr. Pedro Araya, leader of the National Trade Union of Professional Pilots and Technicians of the Lan-Chile company, the Government states, in its communication of  September , that this trade union changed its executive on  and  September ; only three persons out of a total of  members participated in the vote. The undertaking then asked the Appeal Court of Santiago to dissolve the trade union under section (d) of Legislative Decree No.  respecting trade union organisations, which makes provision for a minimum number of members (for works unions  members, representing at least  per cent of all the workers in the undertaking). On  November , the Appeal Court declared the trade union dissolved. Following an appeal by the union executive to the Supreme Court, the latter confirmed the initial ruling. On  April , before the Labour Inspectorate of Maip, Mr. Pedro Araya, signed an end-of-service receipt and received compensation equivalent to US$,.
.As regards the situation of Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the Government states, in its communication of  August , that he was dismissed from the CODELCO undertaking on  July  for reasons which are covered by section , Nos.  and  of Legislative Decree No. , in relation with the State Security Act No.  of , namely numerous acts likely to cause and promote work stoppages in the El Teniente Division as well as other unlawful acts. Mr. Seguel's defence counsel subsequently asked the Second Civil Court of Rancagua to revoke the dismissal. On l March , the court rejected the appeal and thus confirmed the dismissal. Following an appeal lodged by Mr. Seguel's counsel, on  June , the Appeal Court of Rancagua annulled the ruling of the court of first instance. The CODELCO undertaking then lodged an ""appeal of complaint"" with the Supreme Court which, on l July , confirmed the ruling issued by the court of first instance. Following a further appeal for ""re-examination"" lodged by Mr. Seguel's counsel, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision of the members of the competent chamber, confirmed the dismissal. The Government points out that it was thus as a result of a decision by the judicial authorities and not the Government that Mr. Seguel was disqualified from exercising the trade union functions which he had held.
.The Government points out in this connection that the statutes of the Confederation of Copper Workers stipulate, in article , that the loss of the status of leader of an affiliated trade union entails the loss of the status as member of the Executive Council of the Confederation. Furthermore, the statutes of the first level trade union stipulate that in order to be a trade union leader a worker must be employed in the undertaking. Despite his dismissal, Mr. Seguel had been leader of the Caletones occupational trade union, No.  of the El Teniente Division.
.The Government points out that Mr. Seguel may not exercise trade union functions in the Confederation of Copper Workers pursuant to the statutes which the workers themselves have established. On the basis of several principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association in this respect, the Government believes that the proceedings have respected freedom of association. In the Annex to its communication the Government includes the judgements of the courts of first and second instance as well as the final decision of the Supreme Court.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Sergio Troncoso, the Government points out that",1,1984,Chile
224,"this person was arrested for encouraging disorder and incidents in the street. He was banished to Melinka on  August  and then transferred to Puerto Cisnes on  August. The Government adds that the other person mentioned by the complainants, Mr. Juan Ponce, has not been arrested or banished.
.As regards the events which took place during the demonstration of  September , the Government states in its communication of  October  that the Ministry of the Interior has requested the courts to determine the responsibility of the instigators, organisers and promoters of this protest day as well as that of the participants. The Santiago Court has indicted Messrs. Seguel and Bustos on charges of violations of several provisions of the State Security Act (meetings aimed at the overthrow of the Government or at conspiracy against its stability; calling of public meetings in public places without authorisation or liable to disturb public order; inciting the interruption of collective suspension of or strikes in public services or public utilities which involve disturbances of public order or in these services). The Court held Messrs. Seguel and Bustos to be repeated offenders. Following an appeal by their defence counsel, the Supreme Court unanimously confirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance. The four AGECH leaders were also arrested for their participation in the demonstration of  September . According to the Government, this day of protest led to ten deaths, the serious wounding of  police officers, over  injured persons, damage amounting to  million pesos caused by violent acts and serious damage to public property. The judicial proceedings instituted against the responsible parties is at present continuing.
.The Committee has taken note of the detailed replies furnished by the Government concerning the various aspects of this case. It has also noted the general comments made by the Government concerning the trade union situation in Chile. Although it shares the opinion of the Government that political questions do not fall within its sphere of competence, the Committee must stress the importance of the principle affirmed in  by the International Labour Conference in its resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties that ""the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties which have been enunciated in particular in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and that the absence of these civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights"". The Committee therefore believes that it is empowered, within the terms of its mandate, to examine to what extent the exercise of trade union rights may be affected in cases which allege the infringement of civil liberties.
.As regards the inquiries carried out into the deaths of Messrs. Aguirre, Parada, Guerrero and Natina, the Committee notes that the proceedings are still at the investigatory stage and that in the case concerning the three last mentioned persons, charges have been brought against two former police officers. The Committee, while observing the excessive duration of these investigations, expresses its firm hope that they will be completed very soon and will result in the determination of responsibilities so that the guilty parties can be punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in these matters.
.As regards the attacks against trade union premises, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the forces of order did not enter these premises except in the case of the Confederation of Building Workers where they made inquiries concering precisely the assault on the trade union headquarters which had taken place a few hours before. In these circumstances, the Committee can only stress the importance of protecting trade union premises and the need to shed light on these incidents which have occurred on several occasions. The Committee therefore urges the Government to initiate judicial inquiries into the matter so that the perpetrators of such acts, which are particularly prejudicial to the exercise of trade union rights, may be identified as soon as possible. It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee notes that the persons mentioned in the Annex to its previous report have regained their freedom of movement. It points out, however, that despite the lifting of the state of siege, several allegations refer to new arrests and banishments concerning which the Government has supplied certain information (see Annex). In the Committee's opinion the repeated application of measures of this type cannot but prove detrimental to labour relations in the country. The Committee therefore requests the Government, with a view to restoring a climate of social peace and normal trade union activity, to take the necessary measures to end these banishments as soon as possible. It requests the Government to keep it informed of all steps taken to this end.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that several trade union leaders (Messrs. Troncoso, Fugueroa, Rivera, Bustamente and Bustos) have been either indicted or taken into custody and then released following the dropping of charges. In this respect the Committee must point out that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no subsequent charges are brought may involve restrictions on freedom of association. Governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities concerned receive appropriate instructions to prevent the dangers involved for trade union activities by unjustified measures of arrest. (See, in this regard, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. ; th Report, Case No.  (Haiti), para. .)
.The Committee has, furthermore, received more recent allegations concerning the indictment of several trade union leaders including Messrs. Seguel and Bustos, and of their arrest following a demonstration organised by the National Grouping of Workers. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, these measures were taken by the courts on the basis of offences committed under the State Security Act. It notes that among the provisions referred to by the courts is that concerning the organisation of strikes in public services which, in the present case, took place during the national day of protest. It recalls in this connection that trade union organisations should be able to have recourse to protest strikes with a view to defending the economic and social interests of their members. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way against those responsible for and the organisers of the day of protest.
.As regards the right of assembly, the Committee has noted the explanation supplied by the Government concerning the prohibition of a meeting by Works Union No.  of CODELCO, El Salvador Division, and its statements concerning the new provisions adopted in this respect during the state of emergency. It notes in particular that under certain circumstances, no prior authorisation is required for trade union meetings held within the premises of the organisations. The Government does not, however, state whether the authorities must be notified of these meetings. In general, the Committee must once again point out that freedom of trade union assembly is one of the fundamental aspects of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any intervention likely to limit this right or impede its lawful exercise.
.The Committee has also been informed of several allegations concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders in the teaching, aviation, ports and mines sectors. The Government transmitted replies on the dismissal of Messrs. Pedro Araya, President of the Union of Professional and Technical Pilots, and Seguel, leader of the Confederation of Copper Workers. The Committee notes in particular that Mr. Pedro Araya accepted compensation for his dismissal after his trade union had been dissolved by the courts because of insufficient membership numbers. In this respect, the Committee recalls that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is accorded by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unfair dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the true reason for dismissal is his trade union membership or activity. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Dominican Republic), para. .)
.As regards the case of Mr. Seguel, the Committee notes that this person was dismissed after judicial proceedings, according to the Government, for having carried out in particular acts to instigate or encourage work stoppages. In these circumstances, the Committee must observe that Mr. Seguel's dismissal was due to acts which he carried out in pursuance of his trade union responsibilities and that such a dismissal is therefore a measure of anti-union discrimination. This measure is all the more serious since under the legislation and statutes of the Confederation of Copper Workers, Mr. Seguel can no longer be empowered with a trade union mandate. When trade union leaders are dismissed for having exercised their right to strike, the Committee cannot but conclude that they have been punished for their",1,1984,Chile
225,"trade union activities and are the subject of anti-union discrimination. The fact that a judicial authority intervenes in the dismissal procedure does not necessarily constitute, in the opinion of the Committee, a sufficient guarantee against acts of anti-union discrimination, since the powers of the judges in question are limited to ensuring that the national legislation has been correctly applied. Furthermore, the dismissal of a trade union leader is liable to infringe the freedom of action of his organisation and its right to elect its representatives in full freedom, and may even leave the way open for acts of interference by the employer. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Sudan), para. .)
.The Committee notes furthermore that the Government has not replied concerning the dismissals of trade union leaders in the teaching sector (Messrs. Mancilla, Aguilar, Maldonado, Trujillo, Torres) and in the port sector (Mr. Aguirre). The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations in this respect.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that, since its last examination of this case, several matters which had been the subject of allegations before the Committee have not been dealt with by the administrative authorities, but have been placed before the judiciary.(b) As regards the inquiries carried out into the death of Messrs. Aguirre, Parada, Guerrero and Natina, the Committee notes that proceedings are still at the investigatory stage. While observing the excessive duration of these investigations, it expresses the firm hope that these inquiries will be concluded rapidly and will result in the determination of responsibilities so that the guilty parties can be punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in these matters.(c) As regards the attacks against trade union premises, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the forces of order did not enter these premises. The Committee stresses the importance of protecting trade union premises. It urges the Government to initiate judicial inquiries into the matter so that the responsible parties may be identified as soon as possible and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee notes that the persons mentioned in the Annex of its previous report have regained their freedom of movement. It observes, however, that despite the lifting of the state of siege, several allegations refer to new arrests and banishments concerning which the Government has supplied certain information. The Committee requests the Government, with a view to restoring social peace and normal trade union activities, to take the necessary measures to end these banishments as soon as possible. It also asks the Government to keep it informed of all steps taken to this end.(e) As regards the indictment and preventive detention of trade union leaders, the Committee points out that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no subsequent charges are brought may involve restrictions to freedom of association. The Government should take measures to ensure that the authorities concerned receive appropriate instructions to prevent the dangers involved for trade union activities by unjustified measures of arrest. The Committee reminds the Government that trade union organisations should be able to have recourse to protest strikes with a view to defending the economic and social interests of their members. It requests the Government to supply information on the outcome of the judicial proceedings under way against those responsible for and the organisers of the day of protest held on  September .(f) As regards the right of assembly, the Committee recalls in general that freedom of trade union assembly is one of the fundamental aspects of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which is likely to limit this right or impede its lawful exercise.(g) As regards the dismissals of trade union leaders, the Committee points out that the dismissal of a trade union leader is liable, by reason of the fact that dismissal causes him to lose his status as a trade union officer, to infringe the freedom of association of his organisation and its right to elect its representatives in full freedom and may even leave the way open for acts of interference by the employer. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations concerning the dismissals of trade union leaders in the teaching and port sectors.
.The Committee examined this case at its February  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March )).
.The complainant organisations have since addressed the following communications to the ILO: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  February,  March, ,  and  April and  and  May ; National Federation of Unions of Special Crews, Fishermen and Allied Branches of Chile:  February ; World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  March and  April ; Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile:  March ; World Confederation of Labour (WCU):  March ; Federation of Auxiliary Seamen of Chile (FEMBACH):  April ; World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  April ; the National Grouping of Workers: May . The Government sent observations in communications dated ,  and  March , ,  and  April and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complaints presented in the present case concerned a number of events that had taken place in Chile since September . The allegations referred to the intervention of the forces of order on the occasion of the day of protest held on  September , which is said to have resulted in the death of ten persons, many injuries and over , arrests. The complainants referred in particular to the case of Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, who, they said, had been arrested and tortured and whose body had been subsequently found. In this connection the Government indicated that Mr. Aguirre had not been arrested by the police and that he had been found dead for reasons which had not been established.
.It appeared, in the light of the allegations made, that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations had been attacked by the police and that material had been destroyed and documentation confiscated. The Government did not furnish any information in its reply on the reasons for the searches. Moreover, according to the complainants, arrests had been allegedly made during these operations and the persons concerned had allegedly been mistreated during their detention. It is alleged that they were subsequently banished. In this connection the Government provided information on some of the persons mentioned by the complainants and pointed out that some of them had been released or that others had been arrested during searches made of the premises of extreme left political organisations.
.Finally, the complainant organisations alleged that the proclamation of the state of siege had had very serious consequences for the exercise of trade union rights, in particular the right of assembly. According to the Government, the state of siege had been proclaimed because of the terrorist attacks which had been made in the country.
.At its February-March  Session, the Governing Body approved, in particular, the following conclusions of the Committee:""- The Committee expresses its concern at the serious nature of the allegations made by the complainants. It stresses the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on the employers' and workers' organisations must be based on respect of these civil liberties.- As regards the deaths which occurred during the protest day of  September , the Committee believes that such serious events should lead the authorities to take effective measures with a view to establishing the facts and punishing the guilty parties. It requests the Government to indicate whether an impartial and in-depth inquiry has been carried out into these events and, if so, to inform it of the outcome.- As regards the death of Mr. Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, which allegedly occurred following his arrest, the Committee requests the Government to take all the necessary measures to clarify the circumstances of his death and to determine responsibilities. It requests the Government to furnish information on any inquiry taken and to inform it of the outcome.- As regards the attack by the police on certain trade union premises, the Committee draws to the attention of the Government that the protection of trade union property is one of the basic civil liberties required for the normal exercise of trade union rights. It recalls that the search by the police of trade union premises should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority. The",-1,1984,Chile
226,"Committee requests the Government to furnish information on the circumstances of the operations carried out against the trade union premises and in particular to indicate their purpose and reason.- As regards the arrests and banishment of trade union leaders, the Committee notes that some of the persons mentioned in the complaints are free but that others have been banished. It stresses that the banishment of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their trade union activities is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee notes furthermore that the Government has not furnished any information on some of the persons mentioned in the complaints as having been arrested, or on the allegations made concerning the ill-treatment of the persons arrested. It requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.- The Committee expresses the firm hope that the restrictions concerning the right of trade union organisations to hold meetings will be lifted in the very near future and it requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken to this end.""
.In its communications of  February and  March , the ICFTU refers to the removal of Mr. Manuel Bustos from executive office in the National Confederation of Textile, Clothing and Allied Workers' Union of Chile and Workers' Union No.  of the undertaking SUMAR S.A. In Resolution No. , issued by the Labour Directorate on  February , it is stated that Mr.Bustos was tried and sentenced in , and that according to the legislation in force he is consequently banned from holding trade union office. The Labour Directorate thus pronounced him unfit to exercise trade union functions. The ICFTU states that the person concerned and his organisation have appealed against this administrative decision, the text of which it attaches.
.The allegations made by the National Federation of Unions of Special Crews, Fishermen and Allied Branches of Chile and the Federation of Auxiliary Seamen of Chile refer to the banishment of some of their leaders. The former organisation mentions the case of its president, Sergio Olivares Alfaro, and another officer, Guillermo Risco Uribe. The latter organisation refers to the banishment of Carlos Cueto Hernndez, the national treasurer, who was arrested with Sergio Aguirre, an officer of the Federation of the Port Undertaking of Chile and President of the National Confederation of Maritime and Port Workers and Fishermen of Chile (CONAMAPOCH), and Salatiel Snchez Abarca, General Secretary of CONAMAPOCH.
.In their communications dated respectively  and  March , the WFTU and the WCL allege that the premises of the National Development Project, a legally constituted body, were besieged by the forces of order on  February . During this operation, several trade union leaders were beaten up, dispossessed of their personal effects and documents and threatened with death. The persons concerned were Julio Valderrama Ros, President of the Union of Independent Telephone Workers; Samuel Astorga, President of PROASIN, a trade union assistance bureau; Octavio Gonzlez, an officer of the National Union of Building Workers; Herminio Rodrguez, an officer of the Metropolitan Workers' Command; Luis Espinoza and Ren Bonavides, President and General Secretary respectively of the National Commission of Municipal Workers; and Engelberto Fras, Vice-President of PRODEN. Sergio Snchez, a former officer of the Unitary Central of Workers, and a journalist were also subjected to ill-treatment. The WCL also attaches to its communication a list of  trade union leaders, together with the names of their unions, who are said to have been banished. Some of these leaders were already mentioned in the complainants' earlier communications.
.Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation of Chile explains in its complaint that on  January  the military government of the Province of Chaaral advised the organisation of its decision to forbid trade union assemblies because of the state of siege in force and for reasons of national security. This decision was confirmed on  February. The military government also forbade the holding of by-elections in the trade union on  March , although it had authorised them four days previously.
.In their communications dated respectively ,  and  April , the ICFTU, the WFTU and the WCOTP expressed their grave concern at the attack made by the forces of order on the headquarters of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH) and the abduction of officers of that organisation. Thus, on  March , Mnica Araya, Alejandro Traverso, Eduardo Osorio, Nelson Bermdez and Jos Tolosa were taken away. The WCOTP and the ICFTU state that these persons were later interrogated about their activities, tortured and released. The following day, individuals in civilian clothing forcibly dragged into a vehicle Manuel Guerrero, president of the Metropolitan Sector of AGECH, and Jos Manuel Parada, an official of the Vicariate of Solidarity. Shots were fired at persons attempting to come to their rescue. The bodies of Messrs. Guerrero and Parada were subsequently found horribly mutilated. In its communication of  April , the ICFTU indicates that appeals for protection were lodged by the eight AGECH leaders because, following these events, they were followed and threatened. The persons involved are: Jorge Pavez, Guillermo Scherpping, Alejandro Traverso, Samuel Bellos, Eduardo Osorio, Maria Rozas, Fernando Azula and Carlos Baeza.
.According to the WFTU and the WCOTP, these events are linked with the national strike of  October  in which AGECH took part. The WCOTP states that reprisals began with the arrest on  October  of four members of AGECH: Juan Ruiz Campes, president of the Provincial Council of Llanquihue; Pedro Ramrez Surez, a member of the Provincial Council of Cachapoal; and two other members of AGECH.
.Still according to WCOTP, trade union leaders were dismissed, banished or arrested following the strike of  October . Thus, under the state of siege declared on  November , about  active members of AGECH were banished to various parts of the country. They included Vctor Ral Manrquez Torres, vice-President of the Metropolino Provincial Council of AGECH, and the executive of the Provincial Council of AGECH at Arica: Benjamn Sierra de la Fuente, President; Linio Tapia Gonzlez, Vice-President; Oscar Arancibia Villalba, General Secretary; and five other members. The ICFTU also refers to the arrest of professors Patricio Garca and Sergio Leval and of the student Alexis Olivares during the transfer of Mr. Guerrero's body. Regarding Manuel Guerrero Ceballos, who had been found dead after being abducted, the WCOTP states that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of this AGECH leader in November . This warrant had been countermanded by the Minister of the Interior in mid-March  and Mr. Guerrero had immediately resumed his trade union functions. Moreover, his home had been ransacked on  November  and he had appealed to the courts for protection.
.The WCOTP also indicates that the Ministries of Education and the Interior had still refused by the end of March  to accept AGECH's requests for a meeting to discuss the arrests and banishments. The Association's correspondence is also alleged to be under surveillance.
.In the view of the WCOTP, the state of siege declared for three months in November  and extended for a further three months is merely a means of preventing the realisation of the democratic aspirations of the various groups making up Chilean society, including the trade unions. The WCOTP considers that the national strike was not a sufficient ground for declaring the state of siege and that the sole purpose of the latter was to legalise repression by conferring broad powers upon the Government and the military.
.In its communication of  April  the ICFTU mentions the arrest of six trade union leaders of the Port of San Antonio: Sergio Aguirre, Salatiel Snchez, Luis de la Cruz Ordenes Seplveda, Pablo Dianta, Carlos Cueto and Dario Zapata. In its communication of  April , the ICFTU also refers to the arrest, on  April, of  persons who were holding an artistic and cultural demonstration in the Chilectra trade union' s headquarters. These persons were arrested during a search of the premises and included several trade union leaders: Victor Hugo Gac, Vice-President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body; Eduardo Loyola, Legal Adviser to the National Grouping of Workers; and Manuel Dinamarca, a former officer of the Unitary Central of Workers. The National Grouping of Workers states that most of the arrested persons were released on  and  April . However,  of them were banished for repeated violations of the law and attacks on public order.
.In its communication of  April , the ICFTU refers to a brutal attack on  April by a group of ten armed and masked civilians on the Building Confederation's premises. The trade union leaders present were ill-treated and had personal effects and property stolen. Their identity cards were confiscated. After this attack the police came to the premises and took away Manuel Bustamante and Jos Luis Figueroa for their statements. Subsequently, on  April, the Ministry of the Interior convoked the Confederation's leaders, Sergio Troncoso, Manuel Bustamante and",1,1984,Chile
227,"Jos Estorgio. The ICFTU fears that they have been arrested. In a subsequent communication, dated  May , the ICFTU states that all these trade union leaders were charged at the request of the Ministry of Labour.
.The ICFTU also mentions the banishment of Adran Fuentes, President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body of Concepcin, to the north of the country. This measure was taken after he had only enjoyed  days' freedom after his earlier banishment.
.According to the ICFTU, Eugenio Madrid, Secretary General of the General Confederation of Land Transport, Miguel Arancibia, trade union adviser and several officers of the peasant organisation ADMAPU, including the President, Jos Santos Millao, Domingo Marileo and Manuel Liquil, have been arrested and banished. The ICFTU points out that Jos Santos Millao had already been arrested in January  following the search of trade union premises. He was brought before the military courts on charges of illegal possession of weapons. He was subsequently released with no charges being held against him.
.Finally, the WCL requests in several of its communications that the ILO send a mission to Chile as a matter of urgency.
.As regards the deaths which occurred during clashes with the police particularly on  September , the Government indicates that an inquiry is being carried out by the competent criminal courts which will decide who was responsible for the deaths upon completion of the investigations. The Government cannot interfere in these matters because of the independence of the judiciary.
.As regards the death of Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, an inquiry is being undertaken by the ad hoc Military Prosecutor appointed by the Supreme Court at the request of the Chilean Roman Catholic Church. The proceedings are at the investigatory stage which is carried out in secret.
.As regards the search of the headquarters of the El Surco National Confederation, the Government states that this organisation lodged an appeal with the Santiago Court of Appeal against the National Information Centre in respect of arbitrary and unlawful acts allegedly committed during the search. This appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal on  November . The Ministry of the Interior has informed the Court of Appeal that it did not order the searches of several trade union premises which took place recently.
.The Government reaffirms that both the searches of the headquarters of the El Surco Confederation and the arrests which took place at the same time were not made on account of trade union activities but on account of partisan political activities on the part of the persons concerned, in violation of current legislation.
.According to the Government, the arrest and subsequent banishment of certain persons are measures which it had to take given the clandestine partisan political activities that they were involved in. These measures were taken by virtue of the powers vested in the President of the Republic by the Constitution during the state of siege.
.The Government states that five of the persons named on the list prepared by the Committee and annexed to its previous report were neither arrested nor affected by any measure restricting their freedom. Nine other persons have been released (see the annex to this case). Mr. Renato Columbano, of unknown profession, is not a trade union leader and was arrested on  November  for his terrorist activities. The following day he was placed on the disposal of the competent court and at the end of his trial was found guilty. He was able to choose his own defence counsel.
.The Government also indicates that the Santiago Court of Appeal rejected the appeals for protection lodged by the lawyers of Carlos Opazo Bascuan, Segundo Cancino Fernndez, Luis Pea Robles, Humberto Arcos Vera and Luis Enrique Avendao Atenas, trade union leaders who have been banished to different parts of the country.
.The Government indicates that the removal from office of Mr. Manuel Bustos was cancelled by the Labour Directorate. It explains that under section () of Legislative Decree No.  of  on trade union organisations, trade union leaders must not have been convicted or be on trial for offences or crimes liable to sentences of imprisonment or for offences relating to the management of trade union assets. Under section () of the same Legislative Decree, removal from office shall be determined by the Directorate of Labour within  days and there is a time limit of five working days for the lodging of an appeal to the courts. Mr. Bustos received a prison sentence in . Despite that, he was elected to office in the Workers' Union No.  of the undertaking SUMAR S.A. in  and then to the Textile Confederation in . The Labour Directorate should have declared him ineligible for office after his election in  but only did so in . Its decision was therefore taken outside the prescribed time and has been annulled. The Government has thus shown its wish to maintain harmonious relations with the leaders of the organisations having legal personality.
.As regards the allegations concerning Mr. Sergio Olivares Alfaro, the Government states that he was arrested and banished to Quirihue until  March . This measure, which was taken by the authorities in virtue of powers granted by the Constitution to the President of the Republic during the state of siege, was in no way related to Mr. Olivares's trade union activities but to his participation in clandestine political meetings.
.The Government indicates that Mr. Guillermo Risco Uribe was not arrested and that he is free. A warrant for his arrest issued on  February  under the provisions governing the state of siege was not acted on. The ground for the warrant was participation in clandestine political meetings where protest action against the Government was decided on.
.Referring to the kidnapping of the leaders of AGECH, the Government states in its communications of  April and  May  that a number of persons were kidnapped on the public thoroughfare by unidentified individuals. According to the Government, these events are part of a pattern of criminal acts ranging from bomb attacks on banks and undertakings to the violent death of two security officials at Concepcin and armed retaliation to police procedures. The recent discovery of arsenals of weapons in various places throughout the country, adds the Government, proves the existence of an organised campaign to prevent the country from returning to normal and to destabilise the Government. Following the kidnapping and murder of Messrs. Parada, Guerrero and Natino, which the Government strongly condemned, the authorities requested the Supreme Court to appoint a senior magistrate to investigate the events and punish the guilty parties. The Court appointed Judge Cnovas Robles, who at once ordered the police services to open an inquiry. Identikit portraits were made of the three suspects and distributed to all the media on the express instructions of the Government. The proceedings are thus at the investigation stage, which, in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure is secret, so as not to hinder investigations. The Government concludes by regretting these events and condemning them with the utmost vigour. It is confident that the judicial courts will soon cast light on all aspects of these events, and for this purpose has ordered its bodies and institutions to collaborate as fully as possible with the courts. The Government and the organs within its jurisdiction played no part in the search of the premises of AGECH or in the kidnapping of its officers, who were released on  March.
.Both the lawyers of the abducted persons and the National Directorate of AGECH lodged a complaint before the Eighth Criminal Court of Santiago for abduction and unlawful association for criminal purposes. Information in the press indicated that there might be a connection between these events and the kidnapping on  March of Messrs. Parada, Guerrero and Natino. If this is proven, Judge Cnovas Robles will also be entrusted with the inquiry.
.The Government indicates that six persons were arrested at the Port of San Antonio by virtue of powers vested in the President of the Republic by the Constitution during the state of siege. These persons were banished to Inca de Oro, Toconao and Caspana. According to the Constitution such banishment can last no longer than  days. This measure had no link to the presumed trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.Before examining each of the aspects of the case, the Committee must stress its deep concern at the difficulties facing a large number of Chilean trade union organisations and their leaders. In particular, it points out that, since its last meeting, the complainants have sent to the ILO communications referring to extremely serious measures or events such as deaths, abductions, arrests and banishment of trade union leaders, the attack on headquarters of organisations and the ban on trade union meetings and elections. The Committee considers that such a climate of violence directed at the trade union movement can only lead to a general feeling of insecurity and fear which seriously threatens the exercise of trade union activities. The",-1,1984,Chile
228,"Committee is of the opinion that the Government should urgently take every measure necessary to put an end to this atmosphere; this implies that respect for the human rights which are essential for the development of trade union activities be guaranteed, in particular the right to personal freedom and security, protection against arbitrary arrest and freedom of assembly, opinion and expression.
.The first allegations made in this case concerned the deaths during the National Protest Day of  September . The Committee notes the Government's statements that an inquiry is being carried out by the competent criminal courts. It requests the Government to supply information on developments in the inquiry and its eventual results.
.As regards the death of Mr. Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros which took place after his arrest, the Committee notes that an inquiry has also been opened and that it is at present at the investigatory stage. The Committee expresses the hope that this inquiry will lead to the rapid determination of responsibilities in this matter. It requests the Government to continue to supply information on this point.
.As regards the attacks on trade union premises, the Committee deplores the fact that, according to the complainants' allegations, since its previous meeting other trade union organisations have been subjected to such acts, especially in the teaching and building sectors. The Committee notes that the Government denies having ordered any searches of the trade union premises involved. It considers that, if this is the case, orders should be given for inquiries to be undertaken with a view to finding the perpetrators of these attacks, which seriously affect freedom of association and call for severe measures by the authorities against those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any inquiries which have been carried out in this regard.
.The Committee notes that a judicial inquiry has been instituted into the death of Messrs. Guerrero and Parada. It requests the Government to supply information on developments in this inquiry and its results.
.As regards the alleged arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee takes note of the information communicated by the Government on some of the persons mentioned by the complainants (see Annex). In particular, it notes that some them have not been arrested, that others have been released and that those who were banished were so treated for reasons not connected to trade union activities such as, for example, clandestine partisan political actions. The Committee must, however, observe that, as regards these latter persons, the Government's statements are of a general nature since they do not refer to the specific concrete acts on which the banishments were based. Consequently, the Committee is unable to come to a decision as to the trade union nature of the activities which were the basis of these measures. Moreover, the Committee notes with concern that many of the persons subjected to banishment orders hold trade union office. It considers that the accumulation of these measures considerably weakens the organisations by depriving them of their leaders and thus limiting their possibility of carrying out activities for the defence and promotion of the interests of their members. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons concerning whom it has not yet replied, as well as on the concrete acts which were the basis for the measures taken against them.
.As regards the allegations concerning the right of assembly, the Committee must note with regret that the Government has taken no measures to lift the restrictions limiting the exercise of this right. On the contrary, the Committee has received new allegations that these restrictions have been imposed on a works union in the National Copper Corporation. Since the Committee has not yet received the Government's reply on this latter point, it requests it to supply its observations in this respect as soon as possible.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the decision to remove Mr. Manuel Bustos from his trade union functions has been annulled by the Labour Directorate. It must, however, recall that when it examined the trade union legislation adopted in June , it considered that provisions concerning ineligibility for reasons of criminal conviction or prosecution could jeopardise the principles of freedom of association. In fact, conviction and prosecution for activities which by their nature could not constitute a genuine threat to the proper exercise of trade union functions should not be grounds for disqualification from holding trade union office (See th Report, Case No. , para. .)
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee expresses its deep concern at the difficulties facing a large number of Chilean trade union organisations andtheir leaders. It considers that the Government should urgently take every measure necessary to put an end to this climate of violence; this implies that respect for the human rights essential for the development of trade union activities be guaranteed.(b) As regards the deaths which took place during the National Protest Day of  September , the Committee requests the Government to supply information on developments in the inquiry opened into this matter and on its eventual results.(c) As regards the death of Messrs. Aguirre, Guerrero and Parada, the Committee expresses the firm hope that the inquiries under way in these matters will lead to the rapid determination of responsibilities; it requests the Government to continue to supply information on these inquiries.(d) As regards the attacks on trade union premises, the Committee deplores the fact that such acts have again been committed against trade union organisations. It notes that the Government denies having ordered searches of these premises and requests the Government to order that inquiries be undertaken with a view to finding the perpetrators of these acts which call for severe measures by the authorities against those found responsible. It  Reports of the Committee on Freedom of Association requests the Government to supply information on any inquiries which have been carried out in this regard.(e) As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, in particular, that some persons were not arrested and that others are free. It considers that the accumulation of these banishment measures considerably weakens trade union organisations by depriving them of their leaders and hindering their activities.It requests the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons - listed in the Annex - concerning whom it has not yet replied and on the concrete acts which were the basis for the measures taken against them.(f) As regards the obstacles to the right of assembly, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not lifted them.It requests the Government to supply its observations on the allegations presented by the Works Union No.  of the National Copper Corporation.
.These complaints and the supplementary information presented by the complainants are contained in the following communications: International federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU): ,  and  October ; , ,  and  November ; National Confederation of Peasants and Indigenous Persons El Surco (jointly with four other Chilean trade union organisations):  November and  December ; World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  November ; the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL):  November ; Trade Unions International of Miners and Workers in Energy:  November ; National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) (jointly with ten other Chilean trade union organisations):  and  November . The Government supplied its observations in communications dated  November  and  January .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its initial complaint the ICFTU explains that the National Group of Workers, together with other organisations, had called on the Chilean people to assemble on  September  at the Plaza de Armas in Santiago. Thousands of persons gathered on the square and when they sang the national anthem the carabineers of the special forces armed with bludgeons burst into the square to disperse the demonstrators. When the latter closed ranks, the police used dogs and tear-gas. During the course of this police action, the President of the National Group of Workers, Rodolfo Seguel, was beaten in the lower part of the abdomen and the testicles.
.The ICFTU adds that the police forces also acted with brutality in the working class suburbs and in the various cities of the country. According to the ICFTU these operations resulted in ten deaths, with  persons injured and , arrests. The complainant organisation includes in the annex to its communication the names of the persons killed and gives details on the number and circumstances of the arrests in the various provinces of the country. The ICFTU also alleges that at the request of the Ministry of the Interior, the following persons were indicted for having organised peaceful protest days",1,1984,Chile
229,"of action: the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS), Jos Ruiz Di Giorgio, President of the petroleum workers and Ral Montecinos, national leader of the copperworkers.
.Subsequently, in its communication of  October , the ICFTU points out that Manuel Bustos and Jos Ruiz Di Giorgio were arrested and are being held at the Santiago prison. The order for their arrest was allegedly made immediately after the National Group of Workers had called for a national strike to be held on  October . The ICFTU points out that the situation of some trade unionists is even more serious since they are not entitled to bail because of their previous convictions.
.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU refers to the situation of Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, a baker's assistant, who was allegedly arrested on  September  by the central carabineer station of Pudahuel and who has since disappeared. The ICFTU points out that Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros was arrested early on the day of the national protest along with Elias Huaquimil Catril as they were going to their places of work. They were beaten in the police van and then taken to the Pudahuel central police station where they were tortured and interrogated about the protest day of action. Other persons were also taken to this place. They were all released unconditionally on  September , on the orders of the military prosecutor with the exception of Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros. On  September  ""an appeal for protection"" was made to the courts. Both the carabineers and the National Central of Information Agency denied his arrest and, on two occasions, the Seventh Chamber of the Appeal Court refused to send a magistrate to the Pudahuel police station to verify if the person in question was detained there. However several witnesses have been able to confirm his presence in this police station.
.In the same communication, the ICFTU also mentions the case of Daro Ibanez Daz, a trade unionist in the building sector who was arrested on  September  along with his two sons following a search of his home without warrant by carabineers and civilians armed with sub-machine guns. Daro Ibanez Daz was taken to the Pudahuel police station and then put into solitary confinement and tortured. On  September  he was abandoned in the street. The carabineers do not officially recognise his arrest. The ICFTU also refers to the case of Sergio Tapia Contreras, a carpenter's assistant, who was also arrested at his home and then tortured in the Pudahuel police station. He was released on  September .
.According to information supplied by the ICFTU in its communication of  November , the legal adviser of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) and of the National Group of Workers, Jorge Donoso, was allegedly arrested on  November  by the security services in the presence of various witnesses. The Government allegedly denies his arrest.
.The complaints of the National Confederation of Peasants and Indigenous Workers El Surco, the World Federation of Trade Unions and CPUSTAL, the Trade Unions International of Miners and Workers in Energy and the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS), as well as the communications from the ICFTU dated  and  November  refer to the storming of certain trade union premises by the security forces on ,  and  November  and the alleged arrests of trade union leaders during these police operations. The complainants point out that the organisations affected by these measures were the National Confederation of Peasants and Indigenous Workers El Surco, the Chilean Mining Federation, the National Confederation of Building Workers, the ""Peasant Triumph' Confederation, the Nehuen Peasant Confederation and the Federation of Agricultural Workers Trade Unions of Santiago. According to the complainants, the searches were carried out without a warrant and the police officials seized material, documents and money and destroyed furniture and property.
.The National Confederation of Peasants and Indigenous Workers El Surco, in its communication dated  December , gives details concerning the search made of its headquarters. It points out, in particular, that the operation was led by ten armed persons in civilian clothing and that all its documents were examined. The persons present, totalling , were searched and individually interrogated and files were established on them. Some were beaten during the course of the interrogations and seven were taken away blindfolded in police vans, and one of them was handcuffed. All the documents of the Confederation as well as miscellaneous items of property were transported in another vehicle. The arrested leaders were taken to a station of the National Central Information Agency where they were once again beaten and subjected to psychological pressure and interrogation. The complainant confederation mentions the case of its Secretary-General, Luis Pea Robles, who had to receive medical assistance during the course of his detention. Following the release of these leaders, the members of their families had to sign a document certifying that they had returned home in good physical condition.
.The complainants have communicated a list of trade union leaders arrested during the searches (see annex to the present case). They are members of the El Surco Confederation, the Confederation of Metallurgical Workers, the Confederation of Building Workers, the Chilean Mining Federation as well as the National Association of Retired Workers. The ICFTU adds that  workers were held in a prison camp in the far north of the country at Pisagua and that an unspecified number of trade unionists were taken to the San Eugenio football stadium following police operations carried out in the La Victoria suburb of Santiago.
.The National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) and the ICFTU, in their communications of  and  November , have also denounced the banishment to the Pisagua camp of Ernesto Vasquez, Victor Meneses and Pablo Poblete, trade union leaders of the city of Arica.
.The complaint of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) and the letter of the ICFTU of  November  also refer to the proclamation on  November  by the Government of the state of siege throughout the national territory for a period of three months. This period may, under the provisions of the national Constitution, be prolonged indefinitely. As a result of the state of siege, the Government adopted Decree No.  of  November  which restricted the right of assembly. On  November , the Labour Directorate issued Circular No.  which covers trade union assemblies, meetings and elections and the establishment of organisations during the period of the state of siege.
.Decree No.  stipulates in sections  and  that all meetings must be authorised in advance by the regional administrator. For such an authorisation to be granted, the written request must stipulate the object or agenda of the meeting, the list of possible participants and the place and date of the meeting. This request must be signed by at least two persons who guarantee the satisfactory conduct of the meeting. Furthermore, section  of the Decree stipulates that meetings which, because of their nature, object or participants, cover the entire country or concern more than one region must be authorised by the Ministry of the Interior. Under section , derogations from this provision are granted to organisations enjoying legal personality, Provided that the meetings are held in the premises or headquarters of the organisations and are exclusively devoted to matters considered by the law to be consistent with their proper objectives. Even in these cases, an advance notice of five days must be given to the provincial governor's office. According to the complainants, these provisions imply in practice that trade unions, federations and confederations must, in addition to the legislation currently in force, conform to standards which seriously hinder their activities.
.As regards the freedom of persons, the state of siege implies that the authorities may detain persons without giving reasons during the entire period of the state of siege. The persons concerned may not be detained in the prisons used for common-law prisoners but are placed under house arrest or held in special places. The National Central Information Agency may make arrests and detain the persons concerned in its public places of detention. It is also possible to banish persons for the duration of the state of siege, which may be prolonged indefinitely. The authorities may restrict freedom of movement from one point to another within the national territory. The ""appeals for protection"" (amparo) which may be made to the courts are also subject to restrictions during the state of siege as regards rights and guarantees, which may be limited or suspended during the period of emergency.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that the allegations made in the present case consist of a lengthy account of events and situations which have occurred in Chile and which have nothing to do with freedom of association. It adds that this account is drawn from periodical reports made by de facto organisations",-1,1984,Chile
230,"existing in the country and sent to the bodies of the United Nations system to justify their illegal existence and to receive the financial aid which enables them to continue their action. The Government believes that the present case does not concern matters of freedom of association and does not therefore fall within the competence of the Committee. It therefore notes with concern that this kind of allegation is being treated as a case. The Government also observes that it is increasingly difficult to give replies to accusations which are vague, imprecise and repetitive and which have nothing to do with freedom of association.
.However, the Government states that it is providing certain information in the spirit of co-operation which it has always maintained with the ILO. Thus the Government refers to the indictment of Messrs. Bustos, Ruiz Di Giorgio and Montecinos. The examining magistrate in this case has opened an inquiry into the alleged infractions of the Act respecting the security of the State during the events which occurred on  and  September  which resulted in serious damage to private property and during which several persons were killed. In addition to the three persons mentioned, charges were brought against principal leaders of the political parties. These persons were considered guilty since it was proven that the offence had been committed and that they had participated in it. However the Government has halted the proceedings and the inquiry is therefore closed. All the persons concerned were released without being tried.
.As regards the allegations concerning Mr. Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, the Government points out that he has not been arrested by the police. The ""appeals for protection"" made on his behalf were rejected by the Appeals Court and he was given legal advice at every moment. He was subsequently found dead for reasons which have not yet been established.
.As regards the alleged physical mistreatment of Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the Government points out that he has not undertaken any criminal proceedings against those responsible for his mistreatment and points out that Mr. Seguel constantly seeks publicity.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that as a result of the troubled internal situation existing in the country which was basically due to repeated terrorist attacks against carabineer stations, and which resulted in the death of several carabineers, the President of the Republic, with the agreement of the Junta, and in accordance with section . of the Constitution, declared the state of siege throughout the national territory on  November  up to  February .
.The Government explains that the state of siege is a constitutional state of emergency which affects certain constitutional rights and guarantees when the internal situation of the country is disrupted. The state of siege can be proclaimed for only a period of  days. The President of the Republic is then invested with the following rights: transfer of persons from one point of the national territory to another; their detention in their own homes or in places which are not prisons or places which are not used for the detention of common prisoners; their expulsion from the national territory. He may also restrict freedom of movement and prohibit entry into or departure from the national territory, suspend or restrict the right of assembly and freedom of information and opinion, restrict the exercise of the right of association and trade unions rights and censure correspondence and communications. All these measures apply, under the provisions of the Constitution, in so far as they are necessary.
.As regards the right to assembly, Supreme Decree No.  of the Ministry of the Interior published in the Official Gazette on  November , stipulates that meetings must, during the period of the state of siege, be authorised in advance by the administrator of the region. However, this prior authorisation is not required for meetings of organisations enjoying legal personality and which are held in their premises or headquarters and which deal with matters which are proper to their objectives. In this case, only an advance notice of five days to the provincial government is required. The Government adds that this is the case of trade unions, federations and confederations of workers and employers.
.Furthermore, the Department of trade union organisations of the Labour Directorate, in Circular No.  of  November , issued instructions concerning the holding of trade union assemblies, meetings and votes as well as the establishment of trade union organisations during the period of the state of siege. This circular stipulates that the assemblies of trade union organisations enjoying legal personality are subject only to the advanced notice of five days provided that the conditions set forth in the previous paragraph are respected. As regards assemblies for the establishment of trade union organisations, the inspection authorities verify, before appointing a ministerial officer to attend the meeting, that authorisation has been given by the regional governor. The authorisation is granted following receipt of a written request, signed by at least two persons who guarantee that the meeting will take place in normal conditions of order. Furthermore, the document must also stipulate the object of the meeting, the list of possible participants and the date and time of the meeting. As regards meetings which concern more than one region, it is the Ministry of the Interior which is responsible for giving authorisation.
.The Legal department of the Labour Directorate, in Circular No.  of  November , also issued instructions concerning the meetings, assemblies and votes of trade unions and workers' groups during the collective bargaining negociations. As regards negotiations held by a trade union, the meetings and votes are subject to an advance notice of five days and must be held in the trade union premises (trade union premises are understood in this connection to mean any place in the undertaking where the union usually meets). When negotiations are held by a group of workers which is not endowed with legal personality, prior authorisation must be requested from the regional administrator's office or, if the negotiations concern workers from more than one region, from the Ministry of the Interior.
.As regards the persons mentioned in the complaints, the Government points out that under Decree No.  of  November , the Minister of the Interior ordered the house arrest of the following persons for a period of  days: Messrs. Humberto Arcos Vera, Herias Castaneda Moreno and Segundo Cancino Fernndez at Quenchi; Messrs. Luis Pea Robles, Carlos Opazo Bascuan and Valentn Osorno Badilla at Achao; Messrs. Luis Avendao Atenas, Enrique Bucherenich Canales and Sergio Dastres Gonzlez at Curaco de Vlez, Messrs. Ariel Urrutia Villalobos and Carlos Araya Velasco at Dalcahue and Messrs. Juan Valencia Vera, Luis Suarez Zegarra and Moiss Labraa Mena at Puqueldn. These persons were arrested during the search carried out of the premises of the ""Popular Democratic Movement"" (MDP) and the ""Socialist Bloc"", extreme left organisations, which are sympathetic to terrorist activities and which do not carry on any trade union activity. The Government adds that Messrs. Rigoberto Lillo Torres, Juan Antinas Antinao, Alamiro Guzmn Ordenes, Luca Morales Alvarez and Esperanza Guerrero Ceballos are not being detained. As regards Mr. Jorge Donoso, the Government points out that he was arrested in the premises of the ""Socialist Bloc"" and released the same day. The Government adds that it is not true that he was the legal adviser of trade unions. He is the director of a newspaper called Fortn Mapocho and has not disappeared since he is free.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns various events which have occurred in Chile since September . Before examining each of the questions raised by the complainants, the Committee considers it must express its concern at the serious nature of the allegations made by the numerous complainant organisations, both national and international, and which concern important aspects of freedom of association and human rights and their relation to trade union rights. The Committee notes in particular that according to the complainants extremely serious measures have been taken in recent months by the authorities against some trade union organisations and their leaders and active members: the death of workers during clashes with the police forces, the arrest and banishment of trade unionists and their ill-treatment, the assault of trade union premises, restrictions on the right of assembly.
.The Committee must first of all stress in this connection that, as stated in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for these civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to the intervention of the police during the day of protest organised on  September  and which allegedly resulted in the death of ten persons, with many injured and more than , arrests. The complainants mention in particular the case of Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros who was",1,1984,Chile
231,"allegedly arrested and tortured and whose body was later found abandoned.
.Although it recognises that the trade union organisations have not given any details on the nature and objectives of the day of protest of  September , the Committee must note with regret that the Government has furnished no information on the circumstances of the deaths of the ten persons killed during this day. The Committee believes that such serious events should lead the authorities to take effective measures to establish the facts and punish those responsible. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether an impartial and in-depth inquiry has been carried out into these events and, if so, to inform it of the outcome.
.As regards the case of Mr. Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, the Committee notes that the complainants have given very detailed information on the circumstances in which he was allegedly arrested and have specified the place of his detention. The Committee cannot, therefore, accept the general statement of the Government which simply indicates that Mr. Aguirre was not arrested by the police and that he was found dead from causes not yet established. Given the extremely serious nature of these allegations, the Committee requests the Government to take all the necessary measures to clarify the circumstances of his death and to determine responsibilities. It requests the Government to furnish information on any inquiry taken in this matter and to inform it of the outcome.
.As regards the arrest of Messrs. Bustos, Ruiz Di Giorgio and Montecinos and the action taken against them, the Committee notes that although they were found guilty by the examining magistrate, the Government has halted the proceedings and the judicial proceedings are therefore closed and the persons concerned are now free. The Committee notes, however, that the Government has not indicated what charges were brought against these trade union leaders. The complainants, for their part, had indicated that the charges were related to the call for a general strike on  October . The Committee considers it useful to recall that trade union organisations should have the opportunity to call for protest strikes particularly with a view to exercising criticism of the social and economic policy of governments.
.It appears, in the light of the allegations made, that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations were attacked by the police and that material was allegedly destroyed and documentation confiscated. The Government does not furnish any information in its reply on the reasons for these searches. In this respect the Committee calls to the attention of the Government that the protection of trade union property is one of the basic civil liberties required for the normal exercise of trade union rights. Whilst trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority, after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that the search be restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued. The Committee therefore requests the Government to furnish information on the circumstances of the operations carried out against the trade union premises and in particular to indicate their purpose and reason.
.According to the complainants, arrests were allegedly made during these operations and the persons concerned were allegedly mistreated during their detention. It is alleged that they were subsequently banished. In this connection the Government has provided information on some of the persons mentioned by the complainants and pointed out that some of them were free or that others had been arrested during searches made of the premises of extreme left political organisations (see annex to the present report). The Committee must note on this point that there is an obvious contradiction between this statement and that of the complainants since the latter stated that arrests had been made during the attacks on the trade union premises of the El Surco Confederation and the Chilean Mining Federation and furnished written testimony in support of their complaint from the persons arrested. The Committee considers it necessary to stress in this connection that the banishment of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their trade union activities is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee must furthermore note that the Government has supplied no information on certain persons allegedly arrested according to the complaints (see annex to the present report) or on the allegations made concerning the ill-treatment of the persons arrested. The Committee therefore requests the Government to furnish its observations in this respect.
.As regards the allegations concerning the state of siege and its resulting consequences on the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government. It notes in particular that, according to the Government, the state of siege was declared because of terrorist attacks which have been committed in the country. Whether the declaration of this exceptional state was justified or not, the Committee's must note that it results in extremely serious consequences for the operation of trade union organisations, in particular as regards their right to hold meetings. In the circumstances, the Committee must therefore stress the importance of the right for trade unions to hold meetings freely without control by the public authorities. The Committee thus expresses the firm hope that the restrictions concerning the right of trade union organisations to hold meetings will be lifted in the very near future and it requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken to this end.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee expresses its concern at the serious nature of the allegations made by the complainants. It stresses that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect of these civil liberties.(b) As regards the deaths which occurred during the protest day of  September , the Committee's believes that such serious events should lead the authorities to take effective measures with a view to establishing the facts and punishing the guilty parties. It requests the Government to indicate whether an impartial and in-depth inquiry has been carried out into these events and, if so, to inform it of the outcome.(c) As regards the death of Mr. Juan Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros which allegedly occurred following his arrest, the Committee requests the Government to take all the necessary measures to clarify the circumstances of his death and to determine responsibilities. It requests the Government to furnish information on any inquiry taken and to inform it of the outcome.(d) As regards the action taken against Messrs. Bustos, Ruiz Di Giorgio and Montecinos, the Committee notes that the proceedings having now been halted by the Government and that the persons concerned are free. Since however the complainants have linked this action to the holding of a general strike, the Committee recalls that the trade union organisations should be able to have recourse to protest strikes, particularly with a view to criticising the social and economic policy of governments.(e) As regards the attack by the police on certain trade union premises, the Committee draws to the attention of the Government that the protection of trade union property is one of the basic civil liberties required for the normal exercise of trade union rights. It recalls that the search by the police of trade union premises should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority. The Committee requests the Government to furnish information on the circumstances of the operations carried out against the trade union premises and in particular to indicate their purpose and reason.(f) As regards the arrests and banishment of trade union leaders, the Committee notes that some of the persons mentioned in the complaints are free but that others have been banished. It stresses that the banishment of trade union leaders or trade unionists because of their trade union activities is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee notes furthermore that the Government has not furnished any information on some of the persons mentioned in the complaints as having been arrested (see annex to the present case) or on the allegations made concerning the ill-treatment of the persons arrested. It requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.(g) The Committee expresses the firm hope that the restrictions concerning the right of trade union organisations to hold meetings will be lifted in the very near future and it requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken to this end.",1,1984,Chile
232,".The complaints are contained in communications received from the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (February,  April and  June ), the World Confederation of Labour ( August ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( October ) and the World Federation of Trade Unions ( November ). The Government replied in communications dated  November  and  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complainants allege that for more than ten years, the Government has denied a great number of trade union officials the right to live in Chile and that they are forced to live in exile. According to the complainants, the officials concerned have not been legally tried and are consequently serving a sentence of indefinite exile which no competent court has pronounced.
.The complainants add that in September , the Ministry of the Interior submitted to the international airlines a list of , persons (including many trade union officials) forbidden to enter the country, so that the airlines operating in Chile would consult the International Police in Santiago before selling a ticket to any of the persons concerned wishing to fly to Chile. Amongst those officials involved is Hctor Cuevas, National President of the Confederation of Building Workers, who was arbitrarily exiled in .
.The complainants add that recently, the exiled officials' situation has worsened, since the Government has given up the system of issuing periodically lists of Chilean citizens authorised to return to the country. Consequently, every exile has to request individually authorisation to return.
.The list of exiled persons provided by the complainant organisations and information on the latter are attached as an Annex to the present case.
.The Government states that the subject-matter dealt with in the present case is irrelevant to freedom of association and considers that it is outside the Committee's competence. The Government is of the opinion that the Committee has been called upon to examine matters of a clearly political nature or which pertain to the police and adds that it notes with concern that the Committee has accepted to deal with claims of this nature, which detract from its true function and should be referred to other fora or bodies dealing with political issues.
.The Government adds that the exile of those persons mentioned by the complainants is in no way connected with trade union activities or with the fact that any of them might have been a trade union official at some point during his life. With respect to these persons, the Government states that the head of the Trade Union Organisations Branch of the Department of Labour has certified that he compared the list of names with the Branch file of trade union officials and that none of the persons on the list is registered as a practising trade union official; furthermore, there are no records indicating that they might once have been officials (in this respect, the Government encloses a certificate dated  December , from the Head of the Trade Union Organisations Branch of the Labour Department).
.The Government claims that many of the persons amongst the  names cited by the complainants either held a ministerial position or were municipal authorities, members of parliament or well-known leaders of political parties and that they left the country of their own free will or sought asylum in the embassies accredited to the country.
.According to the Government, many of the persons named in the list had taken an active part in violent political actions aimed at overthrowing the country's democratic structures. Aware of their acts and following the military takeover of  September , they sought exile in the foreign embassies accredited to the country. It is for this reason, that several of the persons listed are forbidden to enter the country and must first contact the International Police Department in Santiago before the airlines may sell them a ticket to Chile.
.The Government points out that some of those on the list were tried and sentenced to imprisonment by the courts for having committed offences under the State Security Act No.  of  and under Act No.  of  on arms control. In these circumstances, the prison sentences were commuted to exile, and those concerned consequently left Chile to settle abroad in the country of their choice.
.The Government also states that some of the persons mentioned on the list are, at present, not forbidden to enter the country.
.Finally, the Government provides information, contained in the Annex, on each of the persons mentioned in the complainants' list.
.Before examining the substance of the various aspects of the case, the Committee wishes to point out, concerning the Government's statement that the matters submitted by the complainants are of a political nature and, as such, fall outside the Committee's competence, that the role of the Committee is primarily to examine whether the allegations placed before it are linked or not with the exercise of trade union rights. In the present case, the Committee considers that the allegations before it, as they have been presented by the complainants, would seem to be prima facie within its specific competence and must therefore be examined by it; during this examination, the Committee may, in the light of all the information at its disposal, reach the conclusion that there has been an infringement or restriction of trade union rights or, on the contrary, that the issues involved are indeed unrelated to freedom of association.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainants have alleged the forced exile of  trade union officials and trade unionists. The Committee also notes that the case of one of them, Hctor Cuevas, has already been examined by the Committee. (See, for example, th Report, Case No. , paras. -, th Report, para.  and rd Report, para. .) In those cases, the Committee requested the Government to take as rapidly as possible the measures necessary to allow Hctor Cuevas to return to the country.
.In reply to the allegations, the Government has basically stated: () that some of the persons mentioned by the complainants () are not forbidden to enter the country; () that a further  persons held or were candidates for political positions, were political activists or took part in violent political actions; () that  persons were tried and sentenced by the courts for having violated the State Security Act and the Act on arms control and that their prison sentences were commuted to exile; and () that, with the exception of Hctor Cuevas, there are no records showing that the persons mentioned by the complainants have been trade union officials. The complainants, on the other hand, explicitly stated that practically most of the persons concerned were trade union officials, mentioning in the majority of cases the trade union organisation or branch of activity to which they belonged.
.The Committee therefore notes that there exists a contradiction between the allegations and the Government's reply concerning the trade union status of the exiled persons referred to. The Committee would also like to point out that some of the actions penalised by the State Security Act (which served as grounds for sentencing several persons mentioned by the complainants, whose prison sentences were commuted to that of exile), might possibly, in the case of some of the persons mentioned by the complainants, be related to the exercise of trade union rights; indeed, this Act specifically contains provisions concerning action such as: the disruption or suspension of services such as electricity and water; work stoppages or strikes in the public sector or in public utility services or in production, transport and commercial activities, carried out without compliance to the law, and resulting in breaches of the peace; disturbances in public utility service or in those which must continue functioning by law; and damage to any of the essential industries.
.In view of the previous conclusions and since it does not have sufficient information at its disposal to arrive at a separate decision on each of the persons who remain in exile, the Committee recalls the principle that forced exile of trade union leaders and unionists constitutes a serious infringement of human rights and trade union rights since it weakens the trade union movement as a whole (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. .) when it is deprived of its leaders. It considers that any measures taken to enable those persons still in exile to return to the country could contribute towards establishing an atmosphere more favourable for the exercise of civil and trade union rights. The Committee expresses its serious concern at the contradiction between the complainants'allegations and the Government's reply as regards the trade union status or functions of the exiled persons. It regrets that the Government has not supplied more detailed information on the basis of which the Committee might determine whether their exile was in any way connected with their trade union status",0,1984,Chile
233,"or functions. The Committee would appreciate any further information that the Government or the complainants may have to communicate regarding this question.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee recalls the principle that the forced exile of trade union leaders and unionists constitutes a serious infringement of human rights and trade union rights since it weakens the trade union movement as a whole when it is deprived of its leaders.(b) The Committee considers that any measures taken to enable the persons mentioned to return to the country could contribute towards establishing an atmosphere more favourable for the exercise of civil and trade union rights.(c) The Committee expresses its serious concern at the contradiction between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply as regards the trade union status or functions of the exiled persons. It regrets that the Government has not supplied more detailed information on the basis of which the Committee might determine whether their exile was in any way connected with their trade union status or functions. The Committee would appreciate any further information that the Government or the complainants may have to communicate regarding this question.",1,1984,Chile
234,".The complaint is set forth in a communication from the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body dated  May . The Government replied by a communication dated  January l.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.Physical attack on a trade union leader(a) The complainant's allegations . The complainant alleges that Mr. Clotario Blest, the founder of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEF) and of the Unitary Confederation of Workers (CUT), was the victim of a physical attack in May . The attack was perpetrated the day after the leader had participated in the meeting at which the National Command of Workers was formed, bringing together the principal national trade union organisations of the country.(b) The Government's reply . The Government states that at the time it deeply regretted the physical attack made on Mr. Clotario Blest, the founder of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEF). The aide-de-camp of the President of the Republic had therefore visited Mr. Blest's home in order to convey to him the personal feelings of the President of the Republic and his interest in the victim's health.(c) The Committee's conclusion . The Committee observes that neither the complainant nor the Government has indicated who is thought to be responsible for the alleged attack or what form it took. In these circumstances, the Committee does not consider that it is in possession of sufficient information to express an opinion on the matter.
.Allegations concerning detention(a) The complainant's allegations . The complainant organisation makes the following allegations:- On  June  Mr. Roberto Arredondo, the national leader of the Baha Employees' Federation and Chairman of the Regional Council of the Democratic Union of Workers (UDT) at Concepcin, was detained for several hours by carabineros and accused of carrying invitations to the protest called by the National Command of Workers.- On  June  officials of the Police Department detained at Rancagua Marcos Molina, first director of the El Teniente area organisation and treasurer of the Caletones Industrial Trade Union, and Arturo Vera, first director of the Sewel y Mina Trade Union.- Eduardo Seplveda, national leader of the ""Peasant Triumph"" National Confederation of Agricultural Workers, and Jos Morales, President of the Talca Provincial Federation of that organisation, were detained at Talca. Both arrests took place on  June .- In July  Mr. Diego Lebitum, the secretary of Establecimientos Savory Trade Union No. , and Mr. Guillermo Saavedra Pinto, a member of the Union, were arrested while they were holding a peaceful public demonstration in the course of a legal strike called by their union.- In October  Rodolfo Seguel, Eugenio Lpez, Manuel Rodrguez, Eduardo Daz, Juan Meneses and Ens Zepeda, the trade union leaders of the ""El Teniente"" copper mine, were detained for several hours for holding a peaceful demonstration.- Three workers were detained in October  for carrying placards at a peaceful demonstration by  persons who were protesting at having been dismissed en bloc from their work at the Club de la Unin.- In December  Hernol Flores, the President of the ANEF, was detained for distributing leaflets on the public highway.- In December  three leaders of the Youth Department of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body were detained for reading a greeting to Ral Alfonsn, the President of Argentina, in front of that country's Embassy in the capital.- In March  Manuel Bustos, the President of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, and Sergio Troncoso, President of the Confederation of Building Workers, together with other persons, were detained for heading a peaceful protest march demanding the release of Jos Ruiz Di Giorgio.
.With reference to the alleged detention of Mr. Marcos Molina Cataln and Mr. Arturo Vera Mauro, the Government states that at about . p.m. on  June , as those persons were approaching a taxi loaded with leaflets inviting participation in actions directed against the Government, they were intercepted by officers of the Rancagua Police Department, who arrested them and took them to the police station. After interrogation at the police station, where they spent six hours, they were released. There are no legal proceedings in progress against them at the present time and both are at liberty.
.With regard to the alleged detention of Eduardo Seplveda and Jos Morales, the Government states that, ""owing to the time that has elapsed, it has not been possible to confirm these complaints"".
.With reference to the detention of Mr. Diego Lebitum and Mr. Guillermo Saavedra Pinto, the Government states that, owing to the time that has elapsed, it has not been possible to check the accuracy of this complaint. If it was accurate, the matter was purely one for the police and obviously, as has been explained in other cases, detainees are released once the police have checked their identity and address.
.With reference to the detentions which occurred in October , the Government states that, when a breach of public order is attempted, the police, in discharge of their obligation to ensure the maintenance of order and civic peace, proceed to arrest the perpetrators in order to check their identify and address and, if the situation so warrants, summon them to appear before the local police court which deals with offences of this kind. The cases mentioned by the complainant organisation did not reach the stage of being heard by the competent local police court.
.With reference to the detention of Mr. Hernol Flores, the Government states that there is no record of his detention and that, since neither the date nor the place of detention nor the authority which ordered it are mentioned, the information is insufficient for the purpose of verifying the complaint. As to the alleged detention of three leaders of the Youth Department of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, the Government states that this complaint is based on a routine police operation. A group of persons obstructed the free movement of pedestrians and access to the Embassy of the Argentine Republic at Santiago. The police, in the performance of their duty to maintain public order, disbanded this unauthorised public meeting and, when the identity and addresses of those responsible had been checked, they were released. Consequently, the Government continues, this complaint has nothing to do with freedom of association.
.The Government states further that Mr. Manuel Bustos and Mr. Sergio Troncoso were detained, together with five other persons, by carabineros on duty on the public highway on  March  and taken to the First Carabineros Station. The grounds for their detention were that, together with a group of  persons, they went on a march through central streets with the Lawcourts Building as their goal. This procession was held without permission from the authorities and in such a way as to cause obstructions to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. These persons were released immediately after their identity and addresses had been checked and they had been summoned to appear before the local police court for the offence presumed to have been committed. C. The Committee's conclusions . The Committee observes that, with reference to some of the alleged detentions, the Government states that the lack of data from the complainant or the lapse of time has made it impossible to verify the facts. With reference to other detentions, the Government has indicated that the facts had nothing to do with freedom of association or that the persons concerned had been held for several hours for the purpose of checking their identity and addresses, questioning them and, where appropriate, summoning them to appear before the local police court.
.The Committee concludes that it is not in possession of sufficient information to express a separate opinion on each of the alleged detentions. The Committee wishes to point out, however, that the number of instances in which trade union leaders and trade unionists are alleged to have been detained and summonsed or questioned runs to about a score. In these circumstances, while observing that the allegations date back in most cases to  and that the persons in question are at liberty, the Committee considers it useful to repeat that measures depriving trade union leaders and trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights.
.Allegations concerning demonstrations(a) The complainant's allegations . The complainant organisation makes the following allegations: - In October  a public demonstration by  trade union organisations in the Plaza  de Septiembre at Valparaiso was violently prevented. The repressive measures left several persons injured and  in detention. - In November  the Administration at Rancagua withheld permission for marches preparatory to an action proposed by the Workers' Provincial Command of Cachapoal. Similarly the Administration withheld permission for an action by the same organisation in the place it had chosen. - On  December  ",0,1984,Chile
235,"self-employed workers (itinerant vendors) were subjected to brutal repressive action in the centre of Santiago and had to seek refuge in Santiago Cathedral. These workers, organised in the Itinerant Vendors' Trade Union, in addition to suffering physical acts of oppression, were subjected to an illegal scrutiny of their merchandise and prevented from working in the streets of Santiago by a security force composed of special squads of carabineros and civilians reinforced by dogs specially trained to attack human beings. - In January  a demonstration called by the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body was violently put down. Carabineros arrested  persons and left about  injured.(b) The Government's reply . With reference to the allegations concerning the demonstration in the Plaza  de Septiembre at Valparaiso, the Government states that this accusation suffers from vagueness and cannot be verified owing to the time which has elapsed. Generally speaking, the Government points out that the police force has the inescapable duty of maintaining public order and keeping the civic peace and that, if a breach of public order has been attempted, the police obviously has to intervene. In such cases the persons presumed to have been arrested, whose names are not given, are released after their identity and addresses have been checked, unless they are summoned to appear before the competent local police court.
.The Government states further that the Regional Administration at Rancagua withheld permission for marches owing to the problems they create for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Furthermore the Workers' Provincial Command of Cachapoal is not a trade union organisation and has no legal personality, legal existence or known address. Its presumed leaders are not registered and it is not known who elected them or for how long. It is a de facto body accountable to no one.
.With reference to the alleged oppression of itinerant vendors, the Government states that it has not been possible to confirm this complaint. The Government points out that the police periodically dislodge and clear out of the central streets of the city of Santiago a group of itinerant vendors who set themselves up in the roadway and obstruct passers-by, because these itinerant vendors hold no municipal permit or licence and pay no taxes and because the goods they offer for sale are faulty and harmful to the health and hygiene of the population. For these reasons the police expel them from the central area of the city.
.With reference to the alleged violent suppression of the demonstration called by the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, the Government states that this complaint cannot be answered because the exact date and place of the occurrence and the names of the persons presumed to have been arrested are not given. With regard to the presumed detention of persons, the Government states in general terms that, in the exercise of the inalienable duty that vests in every authority in any country to maintain public order, the police are empowered to arrest any persons who on the public highway, in defiance of laws and regulations, proceed to perform acts and deeds which may constitute some offence or punishable act.(c) The Committee's conclusions . The Committee observes that, with reference to two of the allegations, the Government states that the complainants have not furnished enough information. The Committee likewise notes that, according to the Government, the Administration at Rancagua withheld permission for marches preparatory to an action proposed by the Workers' Provincial Command of Cachapoal owing to the problems they would create for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Lastly the Committee observes that the Government has been unable to confirm the alleged oppression of street vendors in the centre of Santiago, although it states that these workers are periodically expelled from the central area by the police for non-compliance with the administrative rules concerning safety, hygiene, taxes, etc. In these circumstances the Committee reiterates in general terms that trade union rights include the right to organise public demonstrations. Although the prohibition of demonstrations on the public highway in the busiest parts of a city, when it is feared that disturbances might occur, does not constitute an infringement of trade union rights, the authorities should strive to reach agreement with the organisers of the demonstration to enable it to be held in some other place where there would be no fear of disturbances.
.Allegations concerning violations of the internal autonomy of trade union organisations(a) The complainant's allegations . The complainant organisation makes the following allegations: - In June  the Provincial Inspectorate of Labour at Santiago removed Ricardo Lecaros, the Vice-President of the Metallurgical Confederation (CONSTRAMET), from office for having been tried under the Act on the Internal Security of the State. - In October  the Provincial Directorate of Labour at Rancagua prevented Rodemil Aranda and Marcos Molina, the present leaders, whose dismissal is under review by the courts, from standing for election in the Caletones Industrial Trade Union. The same Provincial Directorate also suspended the record of the election held in the Caletones Industrial Trade Union. - In October  the Provincial Director of Labour at Rancagua requisitioned the record books of the Caletones Industrial and Professional Trade Unions and the Sewel y Minas Industrial and Professional Trade Unions in order to place them at the disposal of the undertaking for use in support of its case in the proceedings against Rodolfo Seguel.(b) The Government's reply . The Government states that Mr. Lecaros was sentenced for incitement to illegal paralysis of national activities, an offence defined in the State Security Act. This meant that he did not meet the legal requirements for appointment as a trade union leader, since section  of Legislative Decree No.  on the organisation of trade unions requires inter alia that in order to be a trade union leader he should ""not have been sentenced for a crime or an offence punishable by a severe penalty or for an offence relating to the administration of trade union property, or be currently accused of one"". In these circumstances Mr. Lecaros was disqualified for the performance of trade union functions.
.The Government adds that, in virtue of the aforementioned law, a person placed under a disqualification by decision of the Directorate of Labour may appeal to the courts within a time-limit of five days. According to the Government, the information furnished in the complaint is insufficient and it is necessary to know in what court and on what date the person concerned appealed against the order of disqualification, so that more information may be supplied.
.With reference to the allegations concerning Mr. Rodemil Aranda and Mr. Marcos Molina, the Government states that these workers could not stand for election as trade union leaders because they were not workers of the undertaking and proceedings brought by the same persons were pending before the Second Court at Rancagua petitioning that the measure discontinuing their contracts of employment adopted by the ""El Teniente"" Division of CODELCO-Chile should be declared null and void.
.With reference to the suspension of the record of the election held in the Caletones Industrial Trade Union, the Government states that the labour inspectors, in their capacity as authenticating officers, were checking the election on the premises of the trade union when they were notified of a decision of the Court of Appeals at Rancagua directing that the election record should be suspended for such time as the proceedings against three leaders were pending. The election eventually took effect on  January  after this had been authorised by the Court of Appeals at Rancagua.
.Furthermore the Government states that it is not true that the record books of the Caletones Industrial and Professional Trade Unions and the Sewel y Minas Industrial and Professional Trade Unions were requisitioned. In reality the labour inspector placed a copy of the Unions' records at the disposal of the court for use as evidence in the interests of a better decision in the proceedings.(c) The Committee's conclusions . The Committee takes note that, according to the Government, the record books of the Caletones and Sewel y Minas Industrial and Professional Trade Unions were not requisitioned but that the labour inspector placed a copy of their records at the court's disposal for use as evidence in the interests of a better decision in the proceedings against the leader Rodolfo Seguel.
.The Committee observes that the other facts alleged arose as a result of failure to meet the requirements laid down by law for appointment as a trade union leader. One case concerns the disqualification of a trade union leader who was sentenced for illegally paralysing national activities; in another case two leaders could not stand for election because they were not workers of the undertaking, and in a third case the judicial authority ordered the trade union elections suspended for such time as proceedings were pending against three leaders. The Committee wishes to point out in this connection that, when national legislation provides that all trade union leaders shall belong to the occupation in respect of which the organisation",1,1984,Chile
236,"carries on its activities, the principles of freedom of association may be impaired. In fact, in such cases, the dismissal of a worker who is a trade union leader may, by causing him to lose his status as a trade union officer, infringe the freedom of activity of the organisation and its right to elect representatives in freedom, and may even leave the way open for acts of interference by the employer (see Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, General Survey by the Committee of Experts, Report III (Part  B), ILC, th Session, , para. ). Similarly, a law which generally prohibits access to trade union office because of any conviction is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, when the activity condemned is not prejudicial to exercising trade union office with integrity.
.Allegations concerning raids on trade union premises(a) The complainant's allegations
.The complainant organisation makes the following allegations: - Arturo Martnez, the President of the National Graphic Confederation, made an early application for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) on  June  as a result of a visit which carabineros paid to the Confederation's headquarters, without producing a judicial warrant, for the purpose of questioning the caretaker about the activities carried on by that leader. - In June  the headquarters of the National Federation of Petroleum Trade Unions at Santiago was raided. - In November  carabineros made an illegal and violent raid on the headquarters of the Independent Building Workers' Trade Union No.  of Maip while the members and their families were holding a celebration there. Gerardo Rodrguez, a member of the Union, was arrested in the raid and later released without charges. The carabineros threatened to interrupt any other activity of the trade union in the same way. - In March  a group of five persons armed with bludgeons and chains made a night attack on the headquarters of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEF). This was the third attack on the headquarters.(b) The Government's reply . The Government states that it fails to see what connection the facts alleged concerning the National Graphic Confederation can have with freedom of association. According to the Government, the fact that the person presumed to be affected - who has never been arrested - has made an early application to the courts for amparo shows that his rights are being properly protected.
.With reference to the alleged raid on the headquarters of the National Federation of Petroleum Trade Unions, the Government states that it has no information as to its having happened, and notes that there is no indication as to who made the search, or why.
.With reference to the alleged raid on the headquarters of the Independent Building Workers' Trade Union No.  of Maip, the Government states that this trade union applied to the Court of Appeals at Santiago for protection. On  December  the Court ruled denying the application. Those concerned lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, which also rejected it, and the dossier was accordingly closed.
.With reference to the alleged night attack on the headquarters of the ANEF, the Government states that this is ""purely a police matter outside the Government's control"". In order to provide more information it would have been necessary to know the date and, if applicable, the court before which the charge was laid.(c) The Committee's conclusions . The Committee takes note of the Government's reply that it has no information concerning the alleged raid on the National Federation of Petroleum Trade Unions and that the Supreme Court rejected the appeal lodged in connection with the alleged raid on the headquarters of the Independent Building Workers' Trade Union No.  of Maip.
.The Committee observes, on the other hand, that the Government has not expressly denied that the visit paid by carabineros to the headquarters of the National Graphic Confederation was effected without producing a judicial warrant, and that it has confirmed that an application was made to the court in that connection.
.In these circumstances, although it observes that neither the complainant nor the Government has furnished sufficiently detailed information, the Committee reiterates the principle that the right of the inviolability of union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities cannot enter such premises without prior authorisation or without having obtained a legal warrant to do so (see for example th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. , and th Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ).
.Allegations concerning acts of anti-trade union discrimination(a) The complainant's allegations . The complainant organisation makes the following allegations: - In July  the firm of Vercovich Ltda. took reprisals against the workers who had participated in a legal strike, and the workers were unable to induce the competent authority to correct the situation. Twenty-five per cent of the workers involved in the collective bargaining were dismissed and the wages of the remainder were arbitrarily reduced. - In August  eight leaders of the Industria Hucke at Valparaiso were dismissed from that undertaking in virtue of section , clause (f), of Legislative Decree No.  under which staff may be dismissed if the undertaking's needs so dictate. The leaders affected were: Luis Palma Romero, Jos Mrquez, Carlos Carreo Castro, Oscar Bonilla, Manuel Crdenas, Pedro Corts Fredes, Jos Villaln Tapia and Santiago Rubio Seplveda. - In September  the City Hotel threatened to dismiss workers who did not give up the trade union and actually dismissed two workers without the competent authority intervening to correct that situation. - The Hotel Carrera dismissed Juana Santos, chief telephone operator, for her prominent participation in a legal strike. - Abraham Santngel was dismissed  hours after being elected President of Industria Hucke Trade Union No. . - In November  the Empresa Nacional del Carbn (ENACAR) dismissed the trade union leaders of Schwager Trade Union No. : Luis Badilla, Vctor Jaramillo and Juan Flores. Furthermore the Union was dissolved by court order. - In December  the Hotel Galeras dismissed  persons on the pretext of staff cuts, while at the same time offering pay improvements to all who gave up the Union. - In January  the firm of Parro, Alvario y Ca. dismissed two trade union leaders for presenting draft collective agreements. - The firm of Goodyear dismissed Juan Carlos Martnez, the leader of Trade Union No. , in January .(b) The Government's reply . With reference to the allegations concerning the firm of Vercovich Ltda., the Government states that it cannot answer these because the necessary information (date, names, etc.) has not been supplied. The Government also reports that there is no record to show that the persons presumed to have been affected have made use of the statutory remedies.
.With reference to the dismissal of eight trade union leaders from the Industria Hucke at Valparaiso, the Government states that on  August  the contracts of the trade union leaders of Trade Union No.  of the firm of Hucke at Valparaiso (Mr. Carlos Carreo Castro, Mr. Oscar Bonilla, Mr. Luis Palma Romero, Mr. Jos Marquez and Mr. Manuel Crdenas) were terminated by agreement; these persons signed discharges before the Labour Inspectorate stating that the employer owed them nothing and that they had no complaint to make. The leaders of Trade Union No.  (Mr. Pedro Corts Fredes, Mr. Santiago Rubio Seplveda and Mr. Jos Villaln Tapia) were dismissed and proceeded to lay before the courts judicial complaints against the undertaking. The Labour Inspectorate at Valparaiso applied to the firm an administrative fine of  Development Units in cash on  August .
.With reference to the allegations concerning the City Hotel, the Government states that this firm has reported that the trade union is fully operative and its leadership is functioning.
.With reference to the dismissal of the trade unionist Juana Santos the Government explains that, during the legal strike called by the workers' trade union at the Hotel Carrera, the firm temporarily engaged a few persons to do the essential jobs needed to keep the hotel in operation. The person mentioned, who holds no trade union office and who was working as a telephonist, sabotaged the use of the telephone equipment by obstructing the work of her temporary replacement, and for this the firm dismissed her. The person concerned complained of the firm to the courts, which sentenced the employer to pay compensation.
.With reference to the allegations concerning the firm of ENACAR, the Government states that Trade Union No.  was declared dissolved for lack of members by a judicial decision dated  November . The firm of ENACAR offered each of the union's leaders, Mr. Luis Badilla, Mr. Vctor Jaramillo and Mr. Juan Flores, a post because when they were leaders of the trade union they did no work. However, they did not accept the work which the firm offered them and their contracts were withdrawn from them on  November .
.With reference to the dismissal of workers of the Hotel Galeras, the Government states that these dismissals were due to",-1,1984,Chile
237,"economic mismanagement of the undertaking. It is not true that workers were dismissed to induce them to give up the trade union. The fact of the matter was that four persons were dismissed at that time for reasons of expense, and that this did not affect the existence of the trade union at all.
.With reference to the allegations concerning the firm of Parro, the Government states that the two persons dismissed as reported in the complaint were dismissed before the collective bargaining session, so that when the draft collective agreement was presented those persons were not workers of the undertaking. They signed a discharge before the Labour Inspectorate and were paid everything due to them. The collective bargaining was concluded successfully with the signing of a collective agreement for two years ending in January .
.With reference to the firm of Goodyear, the Government states that Mr. Juan Carlos Martnez was President of Operatives' Trade Union No.  and that when he was dismissed he was not a trade union leader. In  proceedings were taken to remove him from office on the grounds that he had misappropriated money intended for the maintenance of the ambulance and for staff recreational activities. The court removed him from office and the Court of Appeals confirmed the removal.(c) The Committee's conclusions . The Committee takes note that the Government states that it cannot answer the allegations concerning dismissals from the firm of Vercovich because the complainant organisation has not supplied sufficient information. The Committee takes note further that, according to the Government, the three leaders of the firm of ENACAR to whom the complainant refers did not accept an offer of work in the undertaking and that five trade union leaders of the Hucke Company at Valparaiso terminated their contracts by agreement with the undertaking. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the dismissals that took place in the Hotel Galeras were only four in number, did not affect the existence of the trade union at all and were due to economic mismanagement of the undertaking. Lastly the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the persons dismissed from the firm of Parro were dismissed before the draft collective agreement was presented and that Juan Carlos Martnez (of the firm of Goodyear) was not a trade union leader when he was dismissed because the judicial authority had removed him from office for misappropriation of funds.
.The Committee observes, on the other hand, that the legitimacy of other cases of dismissal alleged by the complainant has not been substantiated by the Government: namely, the dismissal of Abraham Santngel (which is said to have taken place  hours after his election as President of Industria Hucke Trade Union No. ) and the two alleged dismissals from the City Hotel. The Government acknowledges, on the other hand, that the Labour Inspectorate of Valparaiso applied an administrative fine to the Hucke Company because of the dismissal of three leaders of Trade Union No.  and that in the case of the dismissal of the trade unionist Juana Santos the courts sentenced the Hotel Carrera to pay compensation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that no worker should be subjected to discrimination in employment on the grounds of his trade union membership or activity, whether past or present (see, for example, th Report, Cases Nos. ,  and  (Turkey), para. ). In this connection the Committee has indicated on previous occasions that one way of protecting trade union leaders is to provide that they cannot be dismissed either during the performance of their duties or for a certain period of time after the expiry of their mandate except, of course, where a serious offence has been committed (see, for example, lth Report, Case No.  (Costa Rica), para. ).
.Other allegations(a) The complainant's allegations . The complainant organisation makes the following allegations: - In August  Rodolfo Seguel was prevented from leaving the country to attend the Congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The ban was imposed by Judge Hernn Cereceda. - In October  the Military Junta approved an Act under which the liability for any act of violence perpetrated on the occasion of public protests or demonstrations automatically vests in those who call for such acts. The Act provides penalties of imprisonment, restricted residence or exile. It is perfectly obvious that this Act is directed specifically against the National Command of Workers and any other dissident organisation which calls for the expression of opposition to the regime. - In January  the Chuquicamata Mining Division prevented Rodolfo Seguel, the President of the Confederation of Copper Workers, from entering that mine. - The workers of the Minimum Employment Programme (PEM) and the Employment Programme for Heads of Households (POJH) do not enjoy the right to organise themselves in trade unions and to present petitions.(b) The Government's reply . The Government states that the Code of Penal Procedure allows a judge who is trying a person for the presumed commission of an offence to fix bail for him on condition that he does not leave the country and thus flout the course of justice. The courts and judges are entirely independent in administering justice in Chile. Consequently the fact that Mr. Hernn Cereceda Bravo, Judge of the Court of Appeals at Santiago, has forbidden Mr. Rodolfo Seguel to leave the country is a matter within his sole jurisdiction.
.The Government also states that the allegation that Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the trade union leader, was prevented from entering the Chuquicamata Mining Division could not be verified owing to the vagueness of the information supplied. There is no indication of the exact date, the place of occurrence, the authority which denied him entry, etc., particulars which are needed for a conclusive reply.
.Furthermore the Government states that the Act objected to by the complainant is Act No. , published in the Diario Oficial of  October , which made some changes in Act No.  of  on State Security. The purpose of the Act in question is to punish those who promote or incite to demonstrations designed to disturb public order, incite demonstrations designed to overthrow the constituted Government, incite demonstrations designed to paralyse the country or promote a breach of order and public peace. The Act does not punish protest or public expression of opinion in opposition to the economic, social security or housing policy of the Government. The offence defined by this Act consists not in ""protesting"" but in promoting or inciting acts which violate the public peace. The text reads verbatim as follows: ""(i) Any person who, without permission, promotes or calls for collective public acts in streets, squares and other places in public use and who promotes or incites demonstrations of any other kind that allow or facilitate a breach of the public peace."" These offences are to be punishable by penalties of rigorous imprisonment, restricted residence or exile for the medium term in any of its degrees, i.e. deprivation of liberty for not less than  days and not more than five years. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the perpetrators of these offences will be jointly and severally liable for any damage caused by reason or on the occasion of the aforementioned acts, irrespective of such liability also laying with the material perpetrators of those acts.
.The Government adds that there is not the slightest doubt that there is a relationship of cause and effect between a ""protest call"" of the kind defined by the Act and the consequences that may arise from it. Since May , when the first ""protests"" began, they have steadily grown more violent and have accounted for a great many dead and injured. Those who ""call for protests"" cannot be ignorant of the consequences those calls will have. The judge who investigates the facts will weigh the evidence and the judgement in these proceedings conscientiously as provided by section  of the State Security Act.
.Lastly the Government states that PEM and POJH are a form of unemployment benefit, and that their beneficiaries consequently cannot organise themselves in trade unions. The right to organise in Chile, as under all the systems of legislation in the world, vests only in workers who have an employment relationship with their employer.(c) The Committee's conclusions . The Committee takes note that, according to the Government, the prohibition on leaving the country which was imposed on Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the trade union leader, was ordered by a judge of the Court of Appeals in virtue of the Code of Penal Procedure which allows a person sub judice for the presumed commission of an offence to be prevented from leaving the country. The Committee also notes that the Government states that, for lack of information and details from the complainant, it has been unable to verify the allegation that Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the trade union leader, was prevented from entering the Chuquicamata Mining Division.
.With reference to Act No. , published",-1,1984,Chile
238,"in the Diario Oficial of  October , which punishes ""any person who, without permission, promotes or calls for collective public acts in streets, squares and other places in public use and who promotes or incites demonstrations of any other kind that allow or facilitate a breach of the public peace"", the Committee wishes to point out in this connection that the requirement of administrative permission to hold public meetings and demonstrations is not objectionable per se from the standpoint of the principles of freedom of association. The maintenance of public order is not incompatible with the right to hold demonstrations so long as the authorities responsible for public order reach agreement with the organisers of a demonstration concerning the place where it will be held and the manner in which it will take place.
.Lastly, with reference to the denial to the workers of the Minimum Employment Programme (PEM) and the Employment Programme for Heads of Households (POJH) of the right to organise themselves in trade unions and to present petitions, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government, PEM and POJH are a form of unemployment benefit, with the result that their beneficiaries cannot organise because in Chile the right to organise vests only in workers who have an employment relationship with their employer. In this connection, the Committee points out to the Government that, in virtue of the principles of freedom of association, all workers - with the sole exception of members of the armed forces and police - should have the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing. The criterion for determining the persons covered by that right, therefore, is not based on the existence of an employment relationship with an employer, which is often non-existent, for example in the case of agricultural workers, self-employed workers in general or those who practise liberal professions and who should nevertheless enjoy the right to organise. Consequently the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to recognising the right of the workers of PEM and POJH to organise.
.Lastly the complainant organisation presents a series of allegations which have already been examined by the Committee in connection with other cases, or which do not relate to specific breaches of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:In view of the gravity of the allegations in this case the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not supplied sufficiently detailed replies to all the allegations. It therefore reminds the Government of the importance which it attaches to the following principles:a) Measures depriving trade union leaders and trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights.b) Trade Union rights include the right to organise public demonstrations. The maintenance of public order is not incompatible with the right to h old demonstrations so long as the authorities responsible for public order reach agreement with the organisers of a demonstration concerning the place where it will be held and the manner in which it will take place.c) According to the latest General Survey of the Committee of Experts, national legislation which provides that all trade union leaders shall belong to the occupation in respect of which the organisation carries on its activities may impair the principles of freedom of association. In such a case, the dismissal of a worker who is a trade union leader causes him to lose his status as a trade union officer, and impedes the freedom of activity of the organisation and its right to elect its representatives in freedom. By placing a trade union leader in this situation the employer interferes in trade union activity.d) Similarly, a law which generally prohibits access to trade union office because of any conviction is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, when the activity condemned is not prejudicial to exercising trade union office with integrity.e) The inviolability of union premises implies that the public authorities should not enter such premises without prior authorisation or without having obtained a legal warrant to do so.f) No worker should be subjected to discrimination in employment on the grounds of his trade union membership or activity, whether past or present. The Committee has indicated on previous occasions that the protection of trade union leaders can only be properly ensured if they cannot be dismissed either during the performance of their functions or for a certain period of time after the expiry of their mandate, except in cases where a serious fault has been committed.g) The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to recognising the right of the workers of the Minimum Employment Programme (PEM) and the Employment Programme for Heads of Households (POJH) to organise.",-1,1984,Chile
239,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions dated  May . The Government replied in a communication of  September .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on  May , the Government arbitrarily banished Hctor Basualto, Chairman of the Federation of Fishery Workers in Iquique and of the Regional Trade Union Co-Ordinating Body in Iquique, to the Island of Melinka in the extreme south of the country; access to this island is difficult and the living conditions hard. The complainant adds that this trade union leader is suffering from an advanced form of diabetes and that his life is in danger if he does not receive medical attention.
.In concluding, the complainant demands that this trade union leader be released unconditionally and that he receive health care.
.The Government states that under Decreto Exento (Exempt) Decree) No.  of  May , issued by virtue of Temporary Provision No.  of the Political Constitution of the Republic, Hctor Basualto Aguirre was assigned to forced residence for three months in the locality of Melinka, in the south of the country. He was later transferred to Lago Ranco. The Government adds that the Ministry of the Interior was obliged to take this measure on the grounds that the accused had repeatedly carried out acts of a subversive nature in the city of Iquique, which had no relation whatsoever with trade union activities.
.The Government concludes by pointing out that the restricted residence order to which Mr. Basualto had been subject came to an end on  August  and that, since then, Mr. Basualto has been under no ban whatsoever and enjoys complete freedom of movement within the country.
.The Committee notes that the present complaint concerns the banishment of the trade union leader Hector Basualto to the Island of Melinka, in the south of Chile, on  May .
.The Committee notes that the complainant did not specify the grounds for the banishment of this trade union leader, neither did it mention that these were in relation with Mr. Basualto's position or activities within the trade union; it merely qualified this act as being arbitrary. The Committee also notes that the Government failed to list the concrete acts which gave rise to this banishment and merely stated in a general way that the accused had repeatedly carried out acts of a subversive nature, unrelated to trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, whilst noting that the trade union leader in question has been released, the Committee recalls that measures depriving persons of their freedom, such as banishment or confinement, should only be taken by the courts and not through administrative measures [see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. ].
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes that neither the complainant nor the Government has listed the concrete acts which gave rise to the banishment of the trade union leader Hctor Basualto from  May, to  August .(b) The Committee recalls that measures depriving persons of their freedom, such as banishment or confinement, should only be imposed by the courts and not through administrative measures.",-1,1984,Chile
240,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  April . The Government replied in a communication of  November .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complainant alleges that the Chilean regime declared a state of emergency on  March , a few days before the massive mobilisation of the people which had been called by the National Command of Workers in the form of a national day of protest which was held on Tuesday,  March, and the meeting of a National Assembly of Leaders of first-level trade unions on Saturday,  April, which was to fix a date for a national strike.
.The complainant alleges that, as a preventive measure, their comrades Benedicto Altamirano Flores, Pedro Ahumada Pizarro, Mauricio Arriagada Figuroa, Luis Gatica Hernndez, Macimiliano Gurirrez Ponce, Jos Rodrguez Vidal, Javier Ziga Seguel, Mauricio Candia Yez, Pablo Candia Yez, Pedro Gutirrez Reyes, Gustavo Meneses Seguel, Jos Rivera Carrin, Javier Rodrguez Irabuco, Alejo Catril and Dimas Galaz Segovia were arrested by the security services on Friday,  March, at . a.m. and banished on Thursday,  March, having been accused by the Ministry of the Interior of participating in the protest of  March.
.Furthermore, the complainant alleges that, since  March , the security services have been looking for Jos Figueroa, head of the International Relations Department of the National Federation of Workers of the Building, Timber, Building Materials and Related Activities, who has been obliged to go into hiding. Other trade union leaders are in a similar situation.
.The Government states that in pursuance of Extraordinary Decree No.  dated  March  of the Ministry of the Interior, the persons mentioned by the complainant were banished for  days to various regions in the northern zone of the country. The measure was made in pursuance of the extraordinary powers granted under Article  (transitory provision) of the Political Constitution of the Republic in the event of a disturbance of the public order and peace. The Government adds that under Extraordinary Decrees Nos.  dated  April ,  dated  April  and  dated  May , the measures which had been imposed on Messrs. Mauricio Candia Yez, Pablo Candia Yez, Alejo Catril Licanqueo and Dimas Galaz Segovia were lifted before the end of  days. As regards the other persons concerned, the period of  days has long since elapsed and they are now once again in full possession of their freedom of movement.
.The Government also states that the measure adopted was not designed to restrict freedom of association and was in no way related to trade union activities.
.Finally, as regards the clandestine activities allegedly pursued by Mr. Jos Figueroa, the Government states that it has no information on this matter precisely because of the clandestine nature of these activities.
.As regards the alleged detention and subsequent banishment of  persons, the Committee observes that, according to the complainant, these persons were temporarily arrested as a preventive measure on  March  and were subsequently banished ( March) having been accused of participating in the national day of protest held on  March . The Government, however, makes no reference to the arrest and points out that the measure of banishment to various regions in the north of the country (under a Decree dated  March ) was based on Article  (transitional provision) of the Constitution following the disturbance of public order and peace and was in no way related to trade union activities.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the complainant has given no details concerning the nature and purpose of the national day of protest of  March  called by the National Command of Workers or concerning the manner in which the  banished persons participated in the protest (in particular, whether they acted peacefully or not). It also observes that the complainant, in its reference to these persons, does not use the term trade union leader or trade unionist but ""comrades"". It must nevertheless regret the fact that the Government has not indicated the specific acts which led to the banishment of these persons and that it has simply confined itself to stating generally that this measure was in no way related to trade union activities and that it was taken because of a disturbance of public order and peace.
.In these circumstances, in the absence of any detailed information from the complainant and the Government as to the circumstances which resulted in  persons being banished, and having regard to the fact that several months have now elapsed since the measures in question ceased to apply, the Committee would point out that the banishment of trade union leaders or trade unionists on account of their trade union activities is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the allegation that the security services have been looking for the trade union leader Jos Figueroa since  March  and that as a result he has been obliged to go into hiding, the Committee notes the Government's statement that it has no information on this matter because of the clandestine nature of the activities of the leader in question. In these circumstances, since the complainant has given no information on the reasons why a search is being made for this trade union leader, the Committee considers that this allegation does not require further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) The Committee notes that the Government makes no reference to the alleged temporary arrest of  persons who were subsequently banished.b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the banishment of trade union leaders or trade unionists on account of their trade union activities is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.",0,1984,Chile
241,".The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) appears in a communication dated  March . The Government sent observations in communications dated  May and  September .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , the complainant refers to alleged infringements of trade union rights perpetrated by the Chilean authorities against members of the teaching profession.The WCOTP, on behalf of the Chilean Teachers' Trade Union Association (AGECH), states that the municipalisation and privatisation of education has allowed employers to terminate the employment of numerous teachers on grounds of ""operating requirements of the undertaking, establishment or service"" without protection for the workers, pursuant to sections (f) and , para. , of Legislative Decree No.  of  May .
.According to the WCOTP,  teachers, including Fernando Azula, leader of the AGECH in Santiago, and Luigi Salerno, president of the AGECH in Cachapoal, have thus been dismissed. The complainant states that the AGECH sees the teachers' trade union activities as a major reason for their dismissal. By way of illustration, it encloses press cuttings from the Chilean press of February  referring to statements by Fernando Azula, teacher at Conchali secondary school and leader of the AGECH Metropolitan Regional Board, to the effect that the establishment from which he has been dismissed is directed by a primary teacher who never attends school, whom it is impossible to meet and who prohibits AGECH teachers even from putting up a bulletin on a notice board. In one of the press cuttings, the AGECH observes that Fernando Azula opposed the municipalisation process and denounced the bureaucratic and arbitrary administration of the establishment in which he taught. It was because of his opposition that he was dismissed, concludes the AGECH, which is calling for his reinstatement.
.In its reply dated  May , the Government does not deny that Chile's teaching establishments have been municipalised or privatised and communicates the Ministry of Education's explanations on the subject. The Ministry claims that the municipalisation of teaching establishments is designed merely to reduce excessive bureaucracy in the sector and to make the teaching system more efficient and flexible. Relations between the central authorities and the teaching establishments, on the one hand, and between the provincial authorities and the teachers, on the other, had previously been restricted to administrative matters with very little technical or pedagogical content. The Ministry states that the new system of government subsidies allows a more equitable distribution of the education budget, the subsidies being based on the number of pupils and granted to the school that they attend. The Ministry claims that, even though the system is far from perfect, it is fairer and more democratic.
.According to the Ministry's statistics, , out of a total of , schools that have been municipalised have remained state schools. The remaining  per cent are private schools, of which  per cent are subsidised and therefore controlled by the State and only  per cent ( schools in all) are completely private. According to the Ministry, therefore, there has been an increase of only  per cent in the number of private schools.
.At the same time, the State has promulgated a teachers' Statute dealing, among other matters, with conditions of access to the teaching profession, training, the establishment of an academic scale and the definition of the rights and duties of teachers. The Statute specifies hours of work ( hours per week) and holidays and stipulates that work contracts can be terminated only after a thorough investigation of the reasons therefore. Subsidised private schools are not allowed to dismiss teachers during the holiday period.
.The Government also communicates the text of circular No.  of  August  of the Ministries of the Interior and of Education containing instructions to mayors concerning the administration of the education service in their respective communes; according to these instructions, in the event of the termination of the contract of a teacher the mayor must indicate clearly the reasons therefore so that the teacher concerned can, if he or she wishes, lodge an official appeal against the decision with the competent conciliation committee.
.The Government asserts furthermore that the Ministry has obliged establishments to remit their holiday pay to all teachers dismissed at the end of the school year, since they have received the corresponding subsidies. It adds that it is frivolous to suggest that the teachers were dismissed for trade union reasons; on the contrary, the Ministry, on seeking further information from those in charge of the school establishments, has been able to ascertain that in many cases dismissal was due to negligence on the part of the teacher, failure to comply with the hours of work, non-possession of a teaching diploma or morally reprehensible behaviour towards the pupils.
.According to the Government, the situation of Luigi Salerno and Fernando Azula, AGECH leaders of Rancagua and Santiago respectively, is different. In the case of Luigi Salerno, the communal authorities have furnished clear evidence of negligence in the performance of his duties. As to Fernando Azula, the Ministry would consider the possibility of reinstating him in one of the schools in the metropolitan area.
.In a subsequent communication dated  September , the Government supplies the texts of a number of court decisions concerning Luigi Salerno. It states that he took up his functions on  October  and that his contract initially stipulated a -hour working week which, by mutual consent, was increased to  hours as from  October . However, between  October and  November  Mr. Salerno decided unilaterally and without his employer's authorisation to work shorter hours - a serious breach of contract; on seven occasions during this period he was absent either for the whole day or during the morning only. On  November  his employer notified him of his dismissal on account of this serious breach of his contractual obligations, pursuant to section , para. , of Legislative Decree No.  of . On  November  Mr. Salerno applied to the judge of Rancagua to have the decision overturned on grounds of unjustified dismissal but, on , January , his plea was dismissed by the judge who confirmed the legality of his dismissal. Mr. Salerno then lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal and won his case on  March  when the Court revoked the decision of the first judge, declared the dismissal unjustified and obliged the employer to pay appropriate compensation. On  April  the employer took the matter to the Supreme Court which, states the Government, has not yet passed judgment.
.Regarding Fernando Azula, who took up his functions on  December  at the secondary school of Conchali where he taught for two years and three months, he was notified of the termination of his contract in writing by his employer on  February , having had  days' minimum notice. The parties concerned (employer and employee) subsequently signed a notarised statement on  March  whereby, according to the Government, Mr. Azula received a sum corresponding to three months' salary in settlement. A copy of the letter of dismissal of  January , containing the proposal for compensation that was subsequently accepted by Mr. Azula, was enclosed with the Government's communication.
.In previous cases the Committee has expressed the opinion that it is not incumbent upon it to comment on the problem of breach of employment contract by dismissal, except in cases of dismissal as an act of anti-union discrimination. [See, for example, rd report, Case No.  (Colombia), para. , and th report, Case No.  (Dominican Republic), para. .]
.With respect to the dismissal of a number of teachers and two union leaders which the complainant considers to be acts of anti-union discrimination, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the measures were unconnected with trade union activities but, in a number of cases, were motivated by the teachers' negligence, failure to comply with the hours of work or non-possession of a teaching diploma.
.The Committee has taken note of the documents attached to the Government's reply from which it appears that, in the case of union leader Luigi Salerno, the Court of Appeal has accepted his appeal on grounds of unjustified dismissal and ordered his employer to pay compensation but that the employer has taken the case to the Supreme Court. The Committee also notes, in the case of union leader Fernando Azula, that he has accepted three months' salary as compensation for dismissal. The Committee further notes that the complainant refers to specific infringements of freedom of association allegedly perpetrated by certain employers. In these circumstances, considering that the matter of the dismissal of a trade union leader is still before the Supreme Court, the Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the principle that no person should be prejudiced in his",-1,1984,Chile
242,"employment by reason of his trade union membership or activities. It also emphasises that this principle is especially important in the case of union leaders so as to ensure respect of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely. It requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgment to be handed down by the Supreme Court.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusion:Considering that the matter of the dismissal of a trade union leader is still before the Supreme Court, the Committee reminds the Government that it is important to ensure that adequate protection against anti-union discrimination be granted to union leaders so as to ensure respect of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely. It requests the Government to supply a copy of the judgment which is to be handed town by the Supreme Court.",-1,1984,Chile
243,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  August . The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that between  and  August  the premises of four trade union organisations (the National Confederation of Peasants and Indigeneous Persons ""El Surco"", the National Confederation of Workers of the Building and Building Material Industries, the National Confederation of Metallurgical Workers - CONSTRAMET - and the National Confederation of Textile Workers) were searched without warrant by members of the uniformed Chilean police and the National Information Office (CNI).
.According to the complainant, the police forces committed acts of repression against trade union leaders of these four organisations, destroyed the furniture and other fixtures in the premises and took away correspondence and trade union documents from the files.
.The complainant adds that the leaders of the above-mentioned trade union organisations received death threats both directly and by telephone. Finally, the complainant points out that the President and Secretaries-General of these organisations were banished to inhospitable regions in the south of Chile or expelled from the country.
.The Government states that the complaint presented by the WFTU is a repetition of accusations which have been made in the past. After referring to the constitutional and legal provisions in force which guarantee the inviolability of the home and all private communications, including documents and correspondence, the Government points out that any illegal act of deprivation, perturbation or threat regarding the legitimate exercise of this constitutional right is grounds for seeking the application by the Court of Appeals of the necessary measures for the re-establishment of justice and the protection of the person concerned. The Government states that it has no knowledge that any of those persons affected by the alleged search, destruction of furniture and seizure of trade union documents has applied to the courts.
.As regards the allegation concerning death threats by telephone made to trade union leaders, the Government states that it is impossible to prove the truth of such affirmations since it is convinced that they are made with the sole object of discrediting it. The Government also points out that it has no knowledge that the persons allegedly threatened in this way have requested an investigation by the courts or made a criminal complaint.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the banishing to the south of the country or expulsion of four leaders of the above-mentioned organisations, the Government refers to information which it furnished in connection with Cases Nos. , , ,  and  concerning Carlos Opazo Bascun, Sergio Troncoso Cisterns, Ricardo Lecaros Gonzlez and Hctor Cuevas Salvador. The Government points out however that none of the leaders of the four above-mentioned organisations was arrested, banished or expelled from the country between  and  August  nor subsequently. By the same token their trade union headquarters have not been searched.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant organisation has alleged that the premises of four trade union organisations were searched, that the furniture and other fixtures of the premises were destroyed and that correspondence and trade union documents were seized. The complainant has also alleged that leaders of these trade union organisations received death threats, both directly and by telephone, and that presidents and secretaries of the organisations were banished or expelled from the country.
.The Committee observes firstly that some of the allegations of the complainant organisation (searching of the CONSTRAMET headquarters, banishing and expulsion of trade union leaders) have already been made to the Committee in connection with other cases [see th Report, Case No. , paragraph , th Report, Case No. , paragraph  and Case No. , paragraphs  and ] and that interim or definitive conclusions have been adopted in this connection. Therefore the Committee believes that it is not appropriate to examine these allegations within the framework of the present case.
.As regards the alleged searching of the premises of the National Confederation of Peasants and Indigeneous Persons ""El Surco"", the National Confederation of Workers of the Building and Building Materials Industries and the National Confederation of Textile Workers and the destruction of furniture and documents of these organisations, the Committee notes that it appears from the statements of the Government that no proceedings have been initiated before the courts. Furthermore, given that the Government denies the allegations, the Committee is not in a position to be able to draw conclusions in this respect.
.As regards the death threats allegedly received by trade union leaders of the four trade union organisations mentioned by the complainant, the Committee notes that the Government believes that these allegations were made solely with the purpose of discrediting it. The Committee observes furthermore that it appears from the statements of the Government that the persons allegedly threatened have lodged no criminal complaint with the courts. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that these allegations call for no further examination.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1983,Chile
244,".The Regional Federation of Trade Unions of Agricultural, Agro-industrial and Viticultural Workers and Common Land Holders ""El Despertar del Norte"" presented its complaint in a communication which the ILO received on  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant claims that on  May  Luis Araya Cisternas, leader of the Regional Federation of Agricultural, Agro-industrial and Viticultural Workers and Common Land Holders ""El Despertar del Norte"", and the executive committee of the ""El Progreso"" trade union were attacked without any explanation by the Carabineros of the Punitaqu police station (Province of Limar) while the members of the union were holding a meeting. According to the complainant, the members of the union were made to kneel down and were interrogated.
.The complainant states that the purpose of the meeting was to analyse the situation of peasants on the ""El Progreso"" estate which, save for a part that was reserved for the owner, was turned over to the rural workers after expropriation. The complainant indicates (without stating whether or not he was the owner) that Willy Abuslemen is preventing the peasants from sowing their crops and cutting wood and is harassing them in various ways.
.A letter from the complainant organisation to the Ministry of the Interior, which was attached by the complainant, states that the alleged events took place as the meeting was ending and that a union leader, Luis Araya, was taken away to the Punitaqu police station where he was interrogated before being released. Along with the executive committee of the ""El Progreso"" union, Mr. Araya was brought before the Mayor who warned them that in future they would have to ask permission to hold meetings.
.The Government states that, on  May , the Mayor of Punitaqui was instructed to take steps to ensure law and order on the occasion of a political meeting to be held at a place called El Durazno in the Commune of Punitaqu. Two carabineros attached to the Punitaqu police station carried out these instructions.
.The Government denies categorically the accusations regarding the behavior of the police officials who merely requested Luis Araya, who appeared to be presiding the meeting, to show proper identification and a permit for holding the meeting. According, to the Government, Luis Araya did not hand over any of the documents requested and was therefore taken to the Punitaqu police station where he was released on the same day without any charge against him after verification of his place of residence.
.Finally, the Government points out that the meeting ended without any further incident after the police officers withdrew and that Hugo Edgardo Lemus Alvarado, Ral Toro Araya, Daniel Vega Vega y Amador Corts Corts, who attended the meeting, all confirmed the correct manner in which the police officers behaved.
.The Committee observes that the complainant alleges that several trade union leaders were assaulted by members of the police force during a meeting of members of the ""El Progreso"" trade union.The complainant further alleges that union members were made to kneel on the ground and were interrogated and that one of the leaders, Luis Araya, was held for interrogation before being released. Finally, the complainant claims that the union leaders were ordered to request permission to hold meetings in the future.
.With regard to the alleged aggression by the members of the police force, the Committee observes that the Government denies the allegations and states that the police officers merely requested Luis Araya to show them proper identification and a permit for holding the meeting. In support of its statement, the Government refers to the evidence of four participants in the meeting who all testify that the police officers behaved in a correct manner. In these circumstances, and in view of the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's reply, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.With regard to the holding of the union leader Luis Araya for interrogation and the alleged warning given to him and to the executive committee of the ""El Progreso"" union that they must ask permission to hold meetings in the future, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Luis Araya was taken to the Punitaqu police station because he showed neither proper identification nor permission to hold the meeting, which the Government describes as political, when asked to do so by police officers.
.The Committee wishes to point out that the Government's claim that the meeting was political is unsupported by any evidence. On the other hand, the complainant states that the participants were union leaders or members of the ""El Progreso"" union and that the purpose of the meeting was to analyse the situation of peasants on the ""El Progreso"" estate, specifically in connection with certain alleged abuses. Consequently, and since the Government has not explicitly denied these claims of the complainant, the Committee considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that it was not a trade union meeting.
.In these circumstances, the Committee must draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right to organise and hold trade union meetings is an essential element of trade union rights, that the exercise of that right should not be subject to prior authorization and that the authorities should refrain from any interference liable to restrict that right. [See, for example, th Report, Cases Nos. ,  and  (Chile), paragraph , and Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, General Survey of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, Report III (Part B), ILC, th Session, Geneva, , paragraph ]. In the light of these principles, and although Luis Araya was released on the day he was taken into custody, the Committee regrets that this trade union leader was deprived of his freedom principally, it appears, for not having requested administrative authorization to hold and chair what., in the Committee's opinion, was a trade union meeting.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing, Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The committee must draw the Government's attention to the fact that the right to organise and hold trade union meetings is an essential element of trade union rights, that the exercise of that right should not be subject to prior authorization and that the authorities should refrain from any interference liable to restrict that right.(b) In the light of these principles, and although Luis Araya was released on the day he was taken into custody, the Committee regrets that this union leader was deprived of his freedom principally, it appears, for not having requested administrative authorization to hold and chair what, in the Committee's opinion, was a trade union meeting.",0,1983,Chile

.Following the examination of the case by the Committee in May , new allegations were received from the World Confederation of Labour (dated  September ) and the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body with other Chilean organisations (October ). The Government sent its comments on the questions still pending in communications of  and  November  and  January .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meetings in May and November , when examining the questions which remained pending, the Committee urged the Government to carry out an investigation into the alleged torture of Mara Rozas, Sergio Troncoso (both trade union leaders) and Jos Anselmo Navarrete (trade unionist) and requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome. The Committee also requested the Government to keep it informed of developments with regard to the legal proceedings for the disqualification of union leaders from holding office and the proceedings to revoke the dismissal of union leaders in the undertaking CODELCO-Chile.
.In its communication dated  September , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) sent a press communiqu signed by Mr. Rodolfo Seguel (President of the Confederation of Copper Workers) regarding the provocations and threats to which he is said to have been subjected. The events took place when he was in a restaurant and were made by a group of young persons who were apparently encouraged and applauded by the Commander of the Sixth Region and other local authorities who were also present in the restaurant.
.In its communication of October  the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body with other Chilean trade union organisations allege that the trade unionists Juan Gasca, Marcelino Carrasco, Jos Barahona, Pedro Rodrguez and Juan Soto, workers of the undertaking CODELCO-Chile (El Teniente division), whom the undertaking arbitrarily dismissed in June  as a reprisal for their participation in the work stoppage called by the Confederation of Copper Workers on  June , have been on hunger strike since  September  in order to obtain reinstatement in their jobs. These five trade unionists had gone on another hunger strike in April , which lasted  days and which concluded with an agreement to reinstate them in the undertaking; the latter, however, did not keep its side of the bargain.
.As regards the proceedings for the disqualification of union leaders from holding office and the proceedings to revoke the dismissal of trade union leaders of the undertaking CODELCO-Chile, the Government states that the disqualification proceedings initiated by the undertaking against Messrs. Rodolfo Seguel, Manuel Rodrguez, Armando Garrido, Eugenio Lpez, Roberto Carvajal, Sergio Barriga, Nelson Rivera, Sabino Pez, Jos Escobar and Ral Montecinos ended with rejections of the undertaking's case by the court. The Government adds that the proceedings for the disqualification of Messrs. Ramiro Vargas, Nicanor Araya, Carlos Ogalde and Freddy Hinojosa from holding trade union office are still pending, as are the proceedings to revoke the dismissal of Rodolfo Seguel and  other trade union leaders.
.As regards the allegations of torture, the Government sends joint observations in respect of Cases Nos. , ,  and , stating in particular that it will communicate the results of the proceedings which are still pending (See para.  of the introduction, where the Committee examines these allegations).
.As regards the allegation presented by the World Confederation of Labour, the Government states that this was a mere verbal exchange between private individuals which took place in a restaurant, between Mr. Rodolfo Seguel and another person, a customer, while they were dining at  o'clock at night. When Mr. Seguel entered the premises, which were crowded, he was jeered and whistled at by the customers and became involved in a heated argument with one of them who is said to have provoked him. Mr. Seguel then severely took to task the Commander of the Sixth Region because he had not intervened to defend him and had threatened him. The Government remarks that various persons who witnessed the events in the restaurant have stated that the incident was a minor one and did not go beyond a heated argument between private individuals in a restaurant. If there had been a threat against Mr. Seguel's life, he could have brought a case before the penal courts for this offence. The Government states that it has no knowledge that this has been done.
.As regards the allegation respecting the hunger strike of five former workers of the El Teniente division of the undertaking CODELCO-Chile in order to obtain their reinstatement in the undertaking, the Government states that on  June  the El Teniente division of CODELCO legally terminated the contracts of employment of Messrs. Juan Gasca Jelves, Jos Barahona, Pedro Rodrguez and Juan Soto Yez, in conformity with the provisions of clauses  and  of section  and clause  of section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , i.e. for failure to report for work without a valid reason, serious failure to discharge the obligations implicit in the contract and active participation in the unlawful stoppage of work which occurred in the El Teniente division in June . As regards Mr. Marcelino Carrasco, the division terminated his contract on the basis of clause  of section  of Legislative Decree No. , namely for having directed or participated actively in the work stoppage that occurred on the date mentioned. The Government adds that the workers just mentioned were notified in due time of the decision taken and that none of them applied to the courts within the time limit and in conformity with the procedure laid down by Legislative Decree No. .Consequently, in invoking and having recourse to the grounds mentioned in the Legislative Decree, the El Teniente division of CODELCO was acting in strict compliance with the legal standards regulating the termination of a contract of employment, and thus did not proceed arbitrarily but in strict observance of the legal provisions in force. Finally, the Government announces that, thanks to the intervention of the Director of the ILO Office in Chile, the former workers ended their hunger strike on  November .
.As regards the legal proceedings initiated against union leaders to disqualify them from holding office and the proceedings to revoke the dismissal of trade union leaders from the undertaking CODELCO-Chile, the Committee notes that the disqualification proceedings against ten trade union leaders ended with a rejection by the court of the undertaking's case and that the disqualification proceedings against the trade union leaders Ramiro Vargas, Nicanor Araya, Carlos Ogalde and Freddy Hinojosa are still pending. The Committee also notes that the proceedings to revoke the dismissal of  union leaders are still pending. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of all these pending legal proceedings.
.As regards the allegation relating to the threats and provocations proffered to the trade union leader Rodolfo Seguel in a restaurant, the Committee observes that the versions of the facts supplied by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the Government are contradictory. In these circumstances, given that the alleged facts did not concern trade union activity, the Committee, while noting that no legal action was initiated in this regard, considers that it is inappropriate to pursue its examination of this aspect of the case.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation relating to the hunger strike of five trade unionists who were dismissed in June  in support of their demand for reinstatement in the undertaking CODELCO-Chile, the Committee notes that, after more than a month and a half of hunger strike, these trade unionists ended their fast on  November . In this regard the Committee considers that any measure that might be taken to reinstate these five trade unionists in the undertaking CODELCO-Chile could only contribute positively to the harmonious development of labour relations, all the more so since, according to the complainant's allegations (which the Government has not refuted), the undertaking in question failed to comply with an agreement concluded as the result of an earlier hunger strike, which included the reinstatement of these trade unionists.
.In these circumstances the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions: a) As regards the legal proceedings initiated against trade union leaders to disqualify them from holding office, the Committee notes that the court rejected the case of the undertaking CODELCO-Chile in the cases of ten trade union leaders and that disqualification proceedings are still pending",-1,1983,Chile
246,"against four. The Committee also notes that the proceedings to revoke the dismissal of  trade union leaders are still pending. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of all the pending legal proceedings.b) As regards the allegation relating to the hunger strike of five trade unionists who were dismissed in June  in support of their demand for reinstatement in CODELCO-Chile, the Committee notes that, after more than a month and a half of hunger strike, these trade unionists ended their fast on  November . In this regard the Committee considers that any measure that might be taken to reinstate these five trade unionists in the undertaking CODELCO-Chile could only contribute positively to the harmonious development of labour relations, all the more so since, according to the complainant's allegation (which the Government has not refuted), the undertaking in question failed to comply with an agreement concluded as the result of an earlier hunger strike, which included the reinstatement of these trade unionists. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to reinstate these unionists, and to inform it of the action taken.
.The Committee examined this case at its meetings in November  and February  and, on both occasions, submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. [See th Report, paras. -, and rd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions in November  and February-March , respectively.] Subsequently, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented further allegations in communications dated  February and  March  (the latter signed also by the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF)). The Government sent its observations in communications dated  March and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the alleged torture of Mara Rozas, Segio Troncoso (both union leaders) and Jos Anselmo Navarrete (trade unionist), the Committee notes the Government's statement that it is not responsible for initiating an investigation to determine the truth of the allegations and that it is the alleged victims who must lodge a complaint or initiate criminal proceedings with the courts. The Committee wishes to point out that, although the use of normal legal channels for lodging appeals and the eventual judgment are certainly factors to be taken into consideration, it has always considered its responsibilities to be such that its competence to examine allegations is not subject to the exhaustion of national appeals procedures. The Committee therefore urges the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations of torture and requests the Government to keep it informed of its findings.
.The Committee also notes the information supplied by the Government regarding the petition to have union leaders disqualified from holding office and the appeal against the dismissal of union leaders and concerning developments in the matter of the dismissal of workers employed by CODELCO-Chile. The Committee notes in particular that the legal proceedings have not yet been concluded. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments in these proceedings.
.With regard to the alleged search of the premises of the National Trade Union Coordinating Body, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, the search was conducted with a warrant in accordance with the State Security Act and the contents of the propaganda seized in connection with the  July  ""demonstration"" consisted of leaflets instructing people not to buy anything, not to send children to school and to bang on pots and pans and bearing such slogans as ""Down with Pinochet - National Protest"", etc.
.Since the search was conducted with a warrant, since according to the information in the possession of the Committee, the bodies responsible for organising the  July  ""demonstration"" were political in nature and since the contents of the seized propaganda communicated by the Government makes no reference to occupational demands, the Committee considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.As to the arrest of Jos Ruiz di Giorgio, the Committee notes the Government's statement that he was arrested by decision of a magistrate of the Court of Appeals of Punta Arenas for engaging in acts designed to undermine law and order and not for trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to specify the actual charges brought against Mr. di Giorgio so that it can examine this allegation in full possession of the facts and to inform it of the verdict in his current trial.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee urges the Government to carry out an investigation into the alleged torture of Marta Rozas, Sergio Troncoso (both trade union leaders) and Jos Anselmo Navarrete (trade unionist) and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings concerning the petition to have trade union leaders disqualified from holding office and of the appeal against the dismissal of union leaders employed by CODELCO-Chile.(c) Since the Government has merely stated in general terms that the union leader Jos Ruiz di Giorgio was arrested for engaging in acts designed to undermine law and order and not for trade union activities, the Committee requests the Government to specify the actual charges brought against him.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )]. Subsequently, the Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined this case at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations concerning the allegations still pending [see th Report, para. ]:""The Committee deeply deplores the four deaths and physical assaults which occurred on  June  (second National Protest Day).The Committee expresses its grave concern at the detailed allegations of torture submitted by the complainants and requests the Government to undertake a prompt and independent judicial investigation of the alleged cases of torture (especially with respect to Mara Rozas, Sergio Troncoso - both trade union leaders - and Jos Anselmo Navarrete - trade unionist) with a view to elucidating the facts in full, to identifying the persons responsible and to taking proceedings against them.The Committee asks the Government to take all the measures necessary to ensure that the dismissed trade union leaders ( according to the complainants) are reinstated as soon as possible in their jobs, that the CODELCO firm abandons the legal proceedings it has instituted to disqualify trade union leaders from holding office and that it reinstates all those workers who have been dismissed for trade union reasons.The Committee asks the Government:(i) to send it the findings of the investigations carried out by the normal legal channels into the four deaths and physical assaults which occurred on  June  (the second National Protest Day);(ii) to send its observations on the trial and/or arrest of the  trade union leaders and the five trade unionists mentioned in Annex I;(iii) to send its observations on the allegation that the premises of the National Trade Union Coordinating Body were broken into and that furniture and equipment were stolen;(iv) to send its observations as soon as possible on the recent allegations concerning the abduction, torture and death threats against Ral Montecinos, CTC union leader, on  October , who is presumably in hospital at the moment;(v) to inform it of the results of the judicial investigations under way into the alleged cases of torture, in particular regarding Maria Rozas, Sergio Troncoso - both trade union leaders - and Jos Anselmo Navarrete;(vi) to inform it of the measures taken to put an end to the acts of anti-union discrimination taken against trade union leaders and workers.
.Referring to the deaths and physical assaults that occurred during events on  June , the Government states that it deeply regrets these distressing incidents which would never have occurred had it not been for the irresponsibility of persons who, without measuring the consequences and in spite of previous experience in May, once again encouraged the disruption of law and order. The members of the Carabineros were the main target of the violence unleashed by the demonstrators, which led to a large number of people being seriously injured, some of them by bullet wounds. The Government once again draws attention to the fact that these violent incidents occurred during the night of  June , after a normal working day, in outlying suburbs. They did not involve any union leaders or trade unionists, had no trade union objective and were merely the type",-1,1983,Chile
247,"of criminal acts that are covered by ordinary penal law. Demanding the resignation of the Government, quite apart from encouraging parents not to send their children to school, not to buy anything in the shops, to black-out their houses and bang on pots and pans at  p.m., not to use public transport and not to go to work, can hardly be described as promoting and defending occupational interests or as the outcome of a labour dispute in the course of collective bargaining. Incidents such as these, which involved verbal and physical aggression against members of the Carabineros, setting up barricades and charging a ""levy"" on people driving home from work, attacking and looting commercial establishments, stoning public health vehicles and premises, blowing up electrical installations, etc., obviously have nothing to do with freedom of association.
.The Government is greatly concerned by the fact that this aspect of the case is clear proof of an attempt to divert the Committee from its proper and relevant function and to have it examine matters that have nothing to do with freedom of association and become involved in issues that are entirely outside its sphere of competence and constitute inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of a State.
.As regards the trial and/or arrest of the  union leaders and five other persons referred to in Annex I of the Committee's previous report on the case (th Report), the Government states that, at the same time as it withdrew charges against Rodolfo Seguel for violating the  State Security Act (No. ), the Government withdrew charges against the other copper union leaders and members listed in Annex I of the Committee's report and charged along with Rodolfo Seguel. The persons concerned are not awaiting trial and legal proceedings against them were dropped in September .
.As regards the allegation that the premises of the National Trade Union Coordinating Body were broken into and that furniture and equipment was stolen, the Government draws attention to the Code of Penal Procedure (sections  and  to ), which stipulates that no building or closed premises may be entered and searched except in the circumstances and manner laid down by the law, such as the entering and searching of any public or private enclosed area to apprehend a person or seize books, papers or other objects that may serve to uncover or prove an offence. Consequently, the Government vigorously rejects the accusation that the premises of the said organisation were ""broken into"". It cannot accept that a search conducted by the police in accordance with the law should be described as ""breaking into"". As to the allegation that ""furniture and equipment were stolen"", the Government denies this slanderous accusation. Sections  and  of the Code of Penal Procedure state that instruments, weapons or objects of any kind that are intended to be used in committing an offence shall be seized by the judge, who shall order that they be officially registered and kept under seal. The objects may be returned during or after completion of criminal proceedings if, in the view of the judge, it is not necessary to keep them. The objects seized on the premises of No. , calle Abdn Cifuentes, headquarters of the de facto entity which calls itself the National Trade Union Coordinating Body - namely, typewriters, mimeograph machines, , leaflets in support of the  July  ""Protest"", , handbills with instructions concerning the action to be taken on  July , leaflets, posters and placards with offensive slogans against the Government and documents, literature and various other forms of anti-Government propaganda - were placed before the Court on  July . The owners of these goods must apply to the courts for their return. The Government points out that in Chile the Judiciary is independent of the Executive.
.As to the alleged torture of Maria Rozas, Jos Anselmo Navarrete and Sergio Troncoso, the Government states that the accusations are based on information derived from a document drawn up by persons totally lacking in objectivity, impartiality and independence in terms which are vile and insulting to a member State and which the Government totally rejects. The Government considers, that the complainant has not supplied sufficient precise information on the cases of torture which have allegedly led to the hospitalisation of the victims in a serious condition. The Government consequently expresses its grave concern at the sweeping and false accusations of a complainant who, after a four-day visit to the country as a tourist, claims to be able to judge and condemn a member State. The Government points out that article .] of the Political Constitution of , which deals with the right to life and to physical and psychological integrity, prohibits the use of any, illegal pressure and provides for legal redress for any persons who is deprived of or hindered or threatened in the legal exercise of this right and constitutional guarantee. The Government is not aware that any of those concerned has appealed to the relevant Court of Appeals in exercise of the said right of legal redress to demand the restoration of the rule of law and protection thereunder.
.As to the alleged abduction, torture and death threats on  October  against Ral Montecinos, who is said to be in hospital, the Government states that it has managed to obtain the following information:- At about . a.m. on Saturday  October , as Ral Montecinos Rosales was passing through the Pasaje Anbal Pinto, opposite No.  (bus stop No. ), Avenida Vicua Mackenna, he was stopped by four unknown persons, one of whom punched him in the left eye, injuring him slightly.- Members of the Carabineros from the La Florida police station, who conducted the initial investigations, spoke to a neighbour, Mara Anglica Figueroa Gonzlez, who, hearing Ral Montecinos' calls for help, immediately summoned an ambulance from the Sotero del Ro Hospital, to which he was subsequently taken.- The official of the Carabineros who was on duty at the Medical Assistance Centre registered Ral Montecinos' complaint and made an appointment for him at the local police court of La Florida at  a.m. on Tuesday  October  to confirm his statement regarding the minor injuries he had sustained and provide further information. The La Florida police report bears the number ,.- Emergency medical assistance report No.  of the Sotero del Rio Hospital Emergency Unit gives, as probable diagnosis, a state of ""drunkenness"" and a ""biparietal hematoma"". It adds that no ""alcohol test"" was carried out and the provisional prognosis corresponds to ""minor injuries"". The report states that the patient arrived in ambulance No.  and was examined at . a.m. on  October .
.In view of the foregoing the Government categorically rejects the accusation that Ral Montecinos was arrested by order of the Government or by members of the police.
.The Government repeats its view that it is unacceptable that ordinary offences of this nature should be taken into consideration as infringements of freedom of association merely because the perpetrator or victim of the offence is a union leader.The Government regrets, once again, that these false and slanderous accusations are clear proof of an attempt to divert the Committee from its proper and relevant function and to have it examine matters which have nothing to do with freedom of association, which are outside its sphere of competence and which constitute inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of a State.
.Furthermore, the Government objects to the conclusions and recommendations contained in paragraphs , ,  and (d) of the Committee's th Report. The Government states that it is out of the question to recommend that it interfere in the running of undertakings by requiring that workers who have been dismissed be reinstated or that legal proceedings which undertakings are entitled by law to institute before the courts be abandoned. It cannot accept that a worker's dismissal be seen as a violation of freedom of association, especially where the courts of law are involved. The Government rejects the accusation that the dismissed trade union leaders and workers have suffered from anti-union discrimination for having encouraged protest actions. The Government emphasises that it respects the right of all Chileans to dissent and to protest, provided they do so in a peaceful and orderly manner. It points out, however, that the ""protest actions"" were not promoted by the ""trade union movement"" but by a few leaders with party-political ties. The protest actions, as already explained, led to violent incidents, the breakdown of law and order and attacks against the established government regime.
.According to the Government, the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO), which is responsible for the administration of the work centres of Chuquicamata, El Salvador, Andina and El Teniente, has informed it that the situation as at October  is as follows.- With respect to the disqualification of trade union leaders from holding office, CODELCO requested the relevant courts on  May  to disqualify the union leaders of its Chuquicamata, El Salvador, Andina and El",1,1983,Chile
248,"Teniente divisions, referred to in Annex II (Case No. ) of the Committee's th Report, from holding trade union office. In doing so, CODELCO-Chile invoked its right under section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , as it relates to section  of Legislative Decree No.  of . CODELCO's request that the courts settle the matter cannot be looked upon as an infringement of freedom of association, since its reason for taking such a step was that, although no labour dispute of any kind existed with its employees represented by the union leaders, they had called for an illegal work stoppage on non-occupational grounds. As to the list of union officials concerned by the disqualification, on  October  CODELCO withdrew its request as regards Sergio Neira and Jos Prez, respectively Chairman of the Andina Industrial Union and national leader of the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC), of its Andina division.- Regarding the subsequent dismissal of a number of union leaders from its Andina, El Salvador and El Teniente divisions, referred to in Annex II (Case No. ) of the Committee's th Report, CODELCO acted in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  as it relates to section  of the same Decree. Section  states explicitly that, in the case of workers who are protected against dismissal as trade union officials, the protection provided for by law shall not apply in relation to the reasons specified in section  of the Decree; consequently, prior court authorisation to take appropriate steps need not be sought - without prejudice, of course, to the workers' right to appeal against their dismissal as illegal. if the court finds in favour of the workers, they are reinstated in their post and union office and recover the protection provided for by law. The persons concerned thereupon lodged an appeal to have their dismissal declared null and void. The matter is currently before the courts. CODELCO has stated that it will respect the final decision handed down by the courts. The appellants have formally requested the courts to maintain them in their trade union posts during the proceedings. A recent decision handed down by the Court of Appeals of Rancagua and confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice states that, pending the court's decision regarding their protection against dismissal, union leaders may vote and stand for re-election to their posts (copy of the decision enclosed by the Government).
.The Government states that, just as in the case of the disqualification of trade union leaders from holding office, CODELCO was induced to take action for reasons which had nothing to do with labour problems but were once again inspired by non-occupational considerations. Since in all four Divisions collective agreements had been renewed immediately prior to the incidents leading up to the measures adopted, there were no labour problems pending.
.The Government draws attention to two inaccuracies in Annex II of the Committee's report: first, Roberto Carvajal Mieres is cited under (b) Llanta Union (), El Salvador Area, as having been dismissed whereas his contract is still in force; second, Leonel Abarca Quinteros is cited under (b) Sewell and Mina Industrial Union, El Teniente Area, as having been dismissed whereas his contract is still in force and he is currently President of the said Union. Moreover, union leaders Sergio Neira and Jos Prez, cited under (b) Andina Industrial Union, Andina Area, withdrew their petition that their dismissal be declared null and void on  October .
.Finally, the Government adds that CODELCO has reinstated  per cent of the workers dismissed, following consideration of their, case by special committees set up in the Division.
.Furthermore, the Government points out that the so-called ""peaceful protest"" on  June  was not organised by the country's principal trade union organisations but by political movements involving former parliamentarians and leaders of political parties. Consequently, it is impossible objectively to conclude that the incidents that occurred on the so-called ""peaceful protest days"" and their outcome occurred within a trade union context. Such an unsubstantiated conclusion goes against the case law of the Committee itself.
.The Government repeats once again that it has never engaged in any discriminatory acts against freedom of association and can therefore hardly be expected to take steps to put an end to something that has never taken place.
.The Committee observes that, at various points in its reply, the Government contests the Committee's competence to examine certain matters raised by the complainants which, in the Government's opinion, have no bearing on freedom of association and constitute inadmissible interference in the domestic affairs of a State. The Government refers specifically to the allegations regarding the death of certain persons and physical attacks that occurred on the  July  National Protest Day and to the ""abduction, torture and death threats"" to which union leader Ral Montecinos has allegedly been subjected. The Committee totally rejects the Government's claim that it is examining matters outside its sphere of competence which constitute interference in the domestic affairs of a State. The Committee has at all times emphasised that the purpose of the Committee's entire complaints procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. The procedure moreover protects governments against unsubstantiated accusations, which is why they should recognise the importance of their sending detailed replies to the allegations against them [see for example st Report, para. , and th Report, Case No.  (Guatemala), para. ]. It is only on the basis of the most objective consideration of the information supplied by the complainants and by the governments that the Committee decides whether or not trade union rights have been violated.
.The Committee wishes to point out that, should the allegations as presented by the complainants in the present instance [see th Report, paras.  and ] prove accurate, they could constitute a violation of trade union rights. Consequently, under present procedure the Committee was and is empowered to examine such allegations, along with the observations of the Government, and, should it deem it necessary, to request further information. The Committee wishes to emphasise that, with respect to the aspects of the case referred to by the Government, it did not reach any final conclusions in its th Report but requested the Government for further information.
.The Committee also observes that, referring to its recommendation with respect to the reinstatement of trade union leaders and workers in their jobs and the abandonment by CODELCO of legal proceedings to disqualify union leaders from holding office, the Government states that it is out of the question to recommend that it interfere in the running of undertakings by requiring that workers who have been dismissed be reinstated or that legal proceedings which undertakings are entitled by law to institute before the courts be abandoned. On this point, the Committee wishes to recall that, traditionally, it has made no distinction between allegations against governments and allegations against employers but has considered in each particular instance whether or not the government has ensured the free exercise of trade union rights within the country concerned [see th Report, Case No.  (Burma), para. ; th Report, Case No.  (Guatemala), para. ; th Report, Case No.  (India), para. ]. Consequently, wherever the Committee has concluded that measures of anti-union discrimination exist that are ascribable to the administration of one undertaking or another, it has requested the government concerned to put an end to such measures and, as appropriate, to take steps to restore the situation in which the persons concerned initially found themselves.
.With regard to the deaths and physical assaults which occurred on  June  (second National Protest Day), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the ""so-called peaceful demonstration"" of  June  was not organised by the country's principal trade union organisations (as asserted by the complainants) but by political movements involving former parliamentarians and leaders of political parties. The Committee also notes that, in its previous replies [see th Report, para. ], the Government stated that trade union leaders as such did not take part in the events which occurred on  June and which had no trade union objective and that the persons who died or were wounded were not union leaders and were not engaged in trade union activities. Under the circumstances, the Committee cannot but note the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's reply as to the nature, background and objectives of the National Protest Day of  June .
.With regard to the trial and/or arrest of the  trade union leaders and the five trade unionists mentioned in Annex I (Case No. ) in its th Report, the Committee notes that, in addition to dropping charges against Rodolfo Seguel for violation of the  State Security Act (No. ), the Government likewise withdrew charges against the other union leaders and members listed in Annex I.
.Concerning the allegation that the premises of the National Trade Union Coordinating Body were broken into and that furniture and",-1,1983,Chile
249,"equipment were stolen, the Committee notes the Government's statement and, specifically, that the objects seized included various forms of anti-government propaganda. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the search conducted by the police - which according to the Government, was in accordance with the law - was based on a warrant and to send information regarding the nature, background and objectives of the  July  ""demonstration"" to which part of the seized propaganda is said to refer.
.As to the alleged abduction, torture and death threats on.  October  against union leader Ral Montecinos, who is said to be in hospital, the Committee notes that the Government rejects categorically the accusation that he was arrested by order of the Government or by members of the police. The Committee observes that, according to the Government, the facts of the case are that on  October  Ral Montecinos was stopped by four unknown persons, one of whom punched him in the left eye, causing minor injury. In view of the Government's explanations and the fact that a corresponding complaint was lodged with the judicial authority, the Committee considers that this allegation, which does not appear to have any trade union connotations, does not call for further examination.
.Concerning the alleged torture of Maria Rozas, Jos Anselmo Navarrete and Sergio Troncoso, the Committee notes that the Government is not aware that any of the persons concerned has appealed to the Court of Appeals in exercise of the right to legal redress of any person who is deprived of or hindered or threatened in the legitimate exercise of the constitutional right to life and physical and psychological integrity. The Committee also notes that the Government rejects totally the information contained in the document on which the allegations are based. Nevertheless, since the allegations relate to the physical integrity of trade union leaders, the Committee urges that an investigation be carried out so as to elucidate the facts in full and to identify the persons responsible.The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of its findings.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement regarding the Committee's recommendation with respect to the dismissal of union leaders and workers in the copper sector and the legal proceedings instituted by CODELCO for the disqualification of trade union leaders from holding office. The Committee notes that, according to the Government's reply, the requests presented by CODELCO that trade union leaders in the Chuquicamata, El Salvador, Andina and El Teniente Divisions be disqualified from holding trade union office and that union leaders in the last three Divisions referred to be dismissed were in accordance with provisions currently in force and were based on the fact that, although no labour dispute of any kind existed, the union leaders had called for an illegal work stoppage on non-occupational grounds. Since collective agreements had just been renewed in the four Divisions referred to, there were no labour problems pending.
.The Committee notes, moreover, that on  October  CODELCO-Chile withdrew its request for union leaders Sergio Neira and Jos Prez, of the Andina Division to be declared disqualified from holding office and that, on the same day, the latter withdrew their petition that their dismissal be declared null and void. The Committee observes, moreover, that, contrary to the complainants' allegations, union leaders Roberto Carvajal Mieres and Leonel Abarca Quinteros have not been dismissed. The Committee also notes that CODELCO-Chile has reinstated  per cent of the workers dismissed, following consideration of their case by special committees set up in the Andina Division.
.Under the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that the Government has withdrawn its charge of violating the State Security Act (No. ) which it had preferred against the union leaders and trade unionists whose case the Committee has examined.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the search of the premises of the National Trade Union Coordinating Body conducted by the police (which, according to the Government, was in accordance with the law) was based on a warrant and to send information regarding the nature, background and objectives of the  July  ""demonstration"" to which part of the seized propaganda is said to refer.(c) The Committee urges that an investigation be carried out into the alleged torture of Maria Rozas, Sergio Troncoso (both trade union leaders) and Jos Anselmo Navarrete (trade unionist) so as to elucidate the facts in full and to identify the persons responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the investigation.(d) The Committee hopes that the Government will engage in negotiations with CODELCO-Chile with a view to the reinstatement of the union leaders of the copper sector who have been dismissed and the abandonment of legal proceedings for the disqualification of union leaders from holding office. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect and of the findings of the special committees that CODELCO-Chile has agreed to set up to consider the reinstatement of the workers dismissed.
.The complaints received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the World Confederation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the National Confederation of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries and Allied Activities, and the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers are contained in communications dated , ,  and  June and  July , respectively. The ICFTU sent additional information and new allegations in communications dated  and  June,  July,  August and  October . The WFTU also sent additional information in communications dated  June,  July and  October , as did the National Confederation of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries and Allied Activities in a communication dated  July . The Government replied in communications dated  June,  July,  September and  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that at the beginning of May/June , Rodolfo Seguel, President of the Confederation of Copper Workers, was attacked by individuals in a jeep who repeatedly rammed the car in which he was travelling, in an attempt to push him off the road.
.The complainants further add that on  June , in response to an appeal from the leading democratic organisations belonging to the Chilean trade union movement, their members demonstrated peacefully in various areas of the country, denouncing the regime's reactionary, social and economic policy and making legitimate economic and social claims. The Chilean authorities' response to the second national day of protest - continue the complainants - was to launch a new wave of arrests, break into trade union premises and deploy forces on a wide scale. The severe measures of repression resulted in four deaths (including the youths Particio Yez and Leopoldo Segovia), six injured persons (of whom two were seriously injured) and  arrests, including that of Rodolfo Seguel, President of the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC), arrested on  June  together with his driver in the house of a trade union leader of the Confederation of Copper Workers, after having been assaulted. According to the WFTU, as many as  persons were arrested.
.In communications dated ,  and  June , the complainants point out that  trade union leaders and trade unionists are in detention and committed to trial; they belong to the CTC, the National Confederation of Building Workers and the Confederation of Agricultural Workers and, apart from Rodolfo Seguel, they include Hugo Estivalez (Vice-President of the CTC), Carlos Opazo (President of the Agricultural Confederation ""El Surco""), Sergio Troncoso (President of the National Confederation of Building Workers), Segundo Cancino, Sergio Villalobos, as well as the trade unionists Manuel Caro, Jorge Orstica, Hernol Flores, Federico Mujica and Juan Mimitza. Their only crime is to have demanded that trade union and democratic rights be restored in the country. Furthermore, a considerable number of trade union leaders and thousands of workers (, according to the ICFTU and , according to the WCL) in the copper sector had allegedly arrested and the main copper mines were occupied by the Armed Forces.
.The complainants further allege that on  July , members of the National Information Agency (CNI) broke into the premises of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS), stole furniture and equipment and abducted Mara Rozas, Anselmo Navarrete, Luis Fuentealba, Particia Miranda, Muriel Cornejo and Humberto Arcos, all CNS union leaders. Mara Rozas and Anselmo Naverrete were allegedly brutally tortured and were in a serious physical condition. According to the complainants, Miguel Vega and Arturo Martnez, President and Vice-President of the CNS, respectively, have been in detention since  July , as are three labour lawyers: Gabriel Valdez, Jos de Gregorio and Jorge Lavandero.
.The complainants also",1,1983,Chile
250,"allege the arrest on  June  of Hctor Sols, President of the Metropolitan Trade Union of Excavators and Sewage Workers and Valentn Osorno, trade union leader. The latter, who was arrested by members of the CNI, was later banished, as was Sergio Troncoso, to a locality in the extreme south of the country. The complainants enclose written statements from those concerned, testifying that they were subjected to torture, especially beatings and electric shock treatment.
.With particular respect to the allegations of torture, the ICFTU states that it sent a trade union mission to Chile between  and  July . According to the ICFTU, this mission was able to prove that the regime's secret police (the National Information Agency) continues to subject prisoners to torture. This mission received first-hand evidence from Maria Rozas (trade union leader) and Anselmo Navarrete (trade unionist) - who had just been released - and from Sergio Troncoso (trade union leader), who was still banished at the time. According to this evidence, the methods of torture used range from physical brutality, electric shock treatment, immersion in sewage, sleep deprivation, hypnosis, etc., to ""refined"" techniques of psychological torture.
.The complainants allege that the trade union leader Rodolo Seguel had been arrested again upon an order from the Ministry of the Interior, this time in August , for having protested against the social and economic, political and moral crisis reigning in the country. This trade union leader has allegedly gone on hunger strike to protest against his unfair arrest.
.Furthermore, the ICFTU encloses information on arrests, trials and requests for the disqualification and dismissal of trade union leaders or workers.
.Finally, the complainants allege in recent communications that on Friday,  October, Ral Montecinos, trade union leader of the Salvador area and member of the National Council of the Confederation of Copper Workers, was abducted from a taxi while on his way to the headquarters of this Confederation in Santiago. The abductors, dressed as civilians but presumably members of the National Information Agency, forcefully pushed the trade unionist into another car in front of many witnesses. After being detained for many hours, he was left dying on a wasteland at the outskirts of Santiago. During his captivity, he had been brutally tortured and interrogated about his trade union activities. He was threatened by death if he continued with these activities. According to the complainants, Mr. Montecinos had also received death threats in the hospital to which he was later taken.
.With respect to the allegation that Rodolfo Seguel was attacked by persons travelling in a jeep, who repeatedly rammed into his car, the Government states that on  June , between : and  a.m., Dr. Sergio Sebastiani, Director of the medical surgery ""Confraternidad"" (Brotherhood) in the town of San Bernardo, was driving along the north-south highway in a jeep to attend urgently to a sick patient; glancing into his rear-view mirror, he noticed another car flashing its lights at him to overtake. The doctor was unable to give way because there were other cars in the lane into which he would have had to turn. Suddenly, the car behind overtook the jeep and cut in front of it. The doctor was annoyed by this and at the next traffic lights, he positioned himself behind the car which had overtaken him and, when it was time to go, he sounded his horn repeatedly. As the car did not move forward, he pushed it  meters. The driver of the car then got out and started threatening Dr. Sebastiani. This was merely an incident between two drivers on a highway. Rodolfo Seguel, who at first denounced this incident as an ""attack against his person"", later retracted his statement and declared to the press that it had merely been ""an annoying accident"".
.With respect to the alleged abduction of Rodolfo Seguel and his driver Hernn Garrido on  June , the Government states that, as it has already pointed out in Case No. , Rodolfo Seguel Molina was committed for trial for the role he had played in the events of  May . In spite of the fact that he had been released on bail by the examining magistrate, Mr. Seguel continued to take an active part in the preparation of the demonstrations which took place on  June ; these demonstrations became violent at the hands of some apparently uncontrollable individuals, causing the death of four innocent persons and considerable damage to private property. Bearing in mind the nature of the events of  May, it was foreseeable that the same would happen on  June; however, Mr. Seguel committed the same offence. In view of the fact that release on bail is a favour granted to the accused and that it is annulled if he relapses into the same behaviour which prompted the initial proceedings, the examining magistrate revised his decision to allow Mr. Seguel to be released on bail and ordered that he should go to a pre-trial detention centre. On  July, the magistrate, granting a request from the defence counsel, released him on bail for the second time. From a legal point of view, Mr. Seguel's situation was as follows. the examining magistrate brought two indictments against the accused. The first concerned his alleged breach of section (), of the State Security Act, respecting those who cause, incite or encourage the collective suspension or interruption of activities by calling stoppages or strikes in the public services or public utility sectors, as well as in the production, transport or trade sectors. Mr. Seguel was committed to trial on this account for his alleged role in the events which occurred on  May . The second indictment, for his alleged role in the events which occurred on  June , was brought against him because of his alleged breach of section , paragraph (c), of the State Security Act, with respect to those who conspire, agree to or encourage meetings aimed at overthrowing the established Government or plotting against its stability. On  August , the examining magistrate ruled that the inquiry was over and declared the pre-trial proceedings closed. The Government points out that there was no question of abduction in this case and that Mr. Seguel's driver was released, hours later, once he had been questioned by members of the Police Department. The Government refers to the information it had given within the framework of Case No. , stating that, as a proof of its good intentions, the Supreme Government, on  September , waived the action brought against Mr. Seguel and other members of the Confederation of Copper Workers.
.The Government points out that a third action was brought against Mr. Seguel for insulting the President of the Republic (section (b) of the State Security Act) and that the examining magistrate of the Court of Appeals charged him and ordered his pre-trial detention. Later, on  September , the Supreme Government stayed the proceedings. There are therefore no charges or proceedings pending against Mr. Seguel for breach of the State Security Act.
.Furthermore, the Government states that the incidents which occurred on  June , which went beyond a peaceful demonstration, were aimed at subverting public law and order. Trade union leaders as such did not take part in these events, which did not take place for trade union reasons. They degenerated into acts of extreme violence, with physical assaults and serious damages to private property and public services, estimated to have amounted to approximately $ million. The allegation that  workers were arrested is untrue, since those arrested were hoodlums and delinquents who hurled stones at cars and smashed and looted shops on the outskirts of the town, taking away goods and items which, in one of the districts in question, was estimated by its owners to amount to US$,.
.The Government further adds that it is untrue that , workers in the copper mines were arrested, as alleged by the ICFTU or that , workers in the copper mines in El Salvador, Caletones and El Teniente were arrested, as stated for its part by the WCL. The Government states that the CODELCO firm had cancelled the labour contracts of several workers, dismissed on various grounds within the framework of the law, and these had included several trade union leaders. The Government points out that those dismissed had brought an action against the firm in the ordinary courts, requesting their reinstatement, and that no judgement had yet been made on this matter. Nevertheless, the CODELCO firm, at the request of the Government and trade union leaders, had accepted to set up committees to study the reinstatement of those dismissed. On  August, a committee was accordingly set up in the Andina Province and later in the other provinces.
.The Government also denies the validity of the allegation that the main copper mines had been ""occupied"" by the Armed Forces. It cannot make out the relationship between freedom of association and a situation of this nature.
.Concerning the death of several people, including",-1,1983,Chile
251,"the youths Patricio Yez and Leopoldo Segovia, and the injuries sustained by two people, the Government points out that they were not trade union' leaders, neither were they involved in trade union activities. These people were victims of the extreme violence unleashed by groups of hoodlums who took advantage of the demonstration to commit all sorts of outrages and attack people and private property. The above-mentioned events occurred in the evening of  June, after an ordinary work-day, in the outlying districts of the city. These tragic events, which the Government deplores and which the police were unable to prevent, do not, in its opinion, constitute in any way a violation of freedom of association. After making investigations, the ordinary criminal courts will be entrusted with identifying those responsible for these actions and applying penalties in accordance with the relevant legislation.
.With respect to the banishment of trade union leaders and trade unionists to some localities, the Government states that Sergio Troncoso, Carlos Opazo and Jos Orstica were arrested on  June  for having repeatedly subverted public law and order and disturbing the peace within the country. Applications for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) for these three persons were lodged with the Santiago Court of Appeals but were rejected. On  June , they were banished to the southern localities of Maulln, Chile Chico and Puerto Cisnes, respectively, for a maximum of  days authorised by law. In the case of Valentn Osorno B., Hctor Sols S., Sergio Cancino, Manuel Caro and Sergio de Jess Villalobos, all were banished to various towns throughout the country, that is: Quelln, Curaco de Vlez, Chonchi, Achao, Quenchi, for the maximum of  days authorised by the law, for having subverted public law and order and disrupting peace within the country. Their arrest and subsequent banishment to towns throughout the country was in no way connected to their presumed trade union activities or decided upon because they were allegedly trade unionists.
.Concerning the alleged arrest of Hernol Flores, Federico Mujica and Antonio Mimitza, the Government states that Hernol Flores was committed for trial for an suspected breach of section () of the  State Security Act No. ), upon a decision by a magistrate of the Santiago Court of Appeal. The above-mentioned provision stipulates that those who cause, incite or encourage the collective interruption or suspension of national activities are liable to be prosecuted. While preparations were being made for his trial, Mr. Flores was released on bail. On  August , the magistrate acquitted him, in a judgement of the first instance, of the charge that he had acted in breach of the State Security Act. On  August , the Ministry of the Interior waived the application for appeal which it was entitled to do by law, thereby upholding the acquittal and depriving itself of any further appeal. As far as the other trade union leaders are concerned, Mr. Mimitza and Mr. Mujica, they were unconditionally discharged after having been questioned by the magistrate of Cerda.
.The Government also states that the position of Mara Rozas Velsquez, Jos Anselmo Navarrete Pino, Luis Fuentealba Reyes, Patricia Miranda Verdejo and Muriel Cornejo Bustamante is as follows: on  July , the above-mentioned were arrested and brought before the courts for breach of section , paragraphs (a) and (c), section , paragraph (a) and section () of the  State Security Act (No. ). These clauses stipulate that all those who cause or encourage the suppression of public law and order, conspire against the established Government, foster disturbances or acts of violence which disrupt public peace, as well as those who cause, incite or encourage the collective disruption or suspension of national activities, are liable to prosecution. The examining magistrate ordered that the above-mentioned persons should be detained while the preliminary investigations were being carried out; on Saturday  July , he ordered their unconditional release due to lack of evidence. On the morning of  July , they held a press conference to thank those who had supported them. The allegation that these persons were in hospital and in serious physical condition is therefore unfounded. After the magistrate had received the report from the prosecutor of the Court of Appeal, he ruled that the case should not be continued in view of the fact that at the end of the preliminary investigations there were no detainees or accused persons and no charges had been brought against anyone.
.The Government further adds that the position of Miguel Vega, Arturo Martnez, Humberto Arcos, Gabriel Valdez, Jos de Gregorio and Jorge Lavandero is as follows: Miguel Vega, Arturo Martnez and Humberto Arcos are not in detention. They gave evidence, as witnesses, at the trial against Mara Rozas, Jose Navarrete, Luis Fuentealba, Patricia Miranda and Muriel Cornejo. As far as Gabriel Valdez, Jos de Gregorio and Jorge Lavandero are concerned, they are not labour attorneys but well-known leaders of a political party and are free. One of them held a ministerial post in a previous government and another an electoral position. A magistrate of the Court of Appeal had brought charges against them for an alleged breach of the State Security Act. On  July , the Court of Appeal accepted an application for amparo for these persons and granted them an unconditional release due to lack of evidence. This ruling by the Court of Appeal was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice, the highest court in the Republic.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions;(a) The Committee deeply deplores the four deaths and physical assaults which occurred on  June  (second National Protest Day).(b) The Committee regrets the arrest of  trade union leaders or trade unionists and the banishment, by administrative action, of eight of them. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that such measures, taken for trade union reasons, constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association; it also considers it unacceptable that sanctions of this nature be imposed by administrative action.(c) The Committee expresses its grave concern at the detailed allegations of torture submitted by the complainants and requests the Government to undertake a prompt and independent judicial investigation of the alleged cases of torture (especially with respect to Marfa Rozas, Sergio Troncoso - both trade union leaders - and Jos Anselmo Navarrete - trade unionist) with a view to elucidating the facts in full, to identifying the persons responsible and to taking proceedings against them.(d) The Committee asks the Government to take all the measures necessary to ensure that the dismissed trade union leaders ( according to the complainants) are reinstated as soon as possible in their jobs, that the CODELCO firm abandons the legal proceedings it has instituted to disqualify trade union leaders from holding office and that it reinstates all those workers who have been dismissed for trade union reasons.(e) With respect to the allegations concerning Mr. Seguel, President of the Confederation of Copper Workers, the Committee notes that the Government has waived the three legal actions it brought against him. Nevertheless, the Committee regrets that Mr. Seguel was preventively detained for more than one month for having taken part in the second National Protest Day. From a more general point of view, taking into account all the allegations concerning this trade union leader made within the context of the present case or Case No. , the Committee is of the opinion that Mr. Seguel, one of the leading trade union leaders in the country, has been the subject of a serious case of anti-trade union discrimination.(f) The Committee asks the Government:(i) to send it the findings of the investigations carried out by the normal legal channels into the four deaths and physical assaults which occurred on  June  (the second National Protest Day);(ii) to send its observations on the trial and/or arrest of the  trade union leaders and the five trade unionists mentioned in Annex I;(iii) to send its observations on the allegation that the premises of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body were broken into and that furniture and equipment were stolen;(iv) to send its observations as soon as possible on the recent allegations concerning the abduction, torture and death threats against Pal Montecinos, CTC union leader, on  October , who is presumably in hospital at the moment;(v) to inform it of the results of the judicial investigations underway into the alleged cases of torture, in particular, regarding Marfa Rozas, Sergio Troncosco - both trade union leaders - and Jos Anselmo Navarrete;(vi) to inform it of the measures taken to put an end to the acts of anti-union discrimination taken against trade union leaders and workers.",1,1983,Chile
252,".The complainants allege that some of the legislative provisions in force are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. Thus, Act No.  dated  December  prescribes that in collective agreements concluded after this date, the employer may offer the same conditions of work existing on  December  without any subsequent readjustability. In this way Act No.  allows employers to prevent not only the readjustment of workers' wages when negotiations are initiated but also all future readjustments. This regulation is issued at a time when inflation for the coming year is expected to reach  per cent and is compounded by the fact that the minimum duration of a collective agreement is two years. In the same way, the salaries of public employees have been frozen since August  in pursuance of Decree No.  of that year.
.Likewise, Act No.  dated  December  prohibits trade unions from receiving financial aid from the undertakings to which their members belong as well as from foreign natural or legal persons; in the event of infringement provision is made for the application of penal sanctions and the reimbursement of the amounts unlawfully received. Furthermore, in the Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) of  August , the Government published a list of  undertakings whose workers may negotiate but not go on strike, essentially because such undertakings are strategic establishments for national defence and security. These include the following undertakings; CODELCO (copper mining), Ferrocarriles del Estado (railways), Compaa de Telfonos (telephones), ENTEL, SNAP (petroleum), LAN (air transport), CASCO (gas), Empresa Nacional de Explosivos (explosives), ENDESA (electricity), CHILECTRA and Banco del Estado (State bank).
.The Government states that the Constitutional Court has ruled that Act No.  of , which amends Legislative Decree No.  respecting contracts of work and Legislative Decree No.  respecting collective bargaining conforms to the law. This act was issued on the basis of considerations regarding the economic recession affecting all countries. In the present crisis, the country has not; been able to escape this recession and thus a system of automatic wage indexing would seriously compromise employment. The act had to take realistic account of this situation so as to avoid creating greater, unemployment.
.The Government states that the allegation concerning the;, suspension of readjustment of wages in the public sector is incorrect since remunerations were increased by  per cent in ; moreover, they will be further increased from  January  by  per cent. In addition to the above-mentioned increases, three bonuses equivalent to  per cent of salary have been granted to public employees; two of these bonuses have already been paid and the third was due in November .
.As regards workers who do not enjoy the right to strike, the Government states that, as in all other countries, undertakings exist in Chile in which workers may not strike because of the prejudice which this would cause to the community arising out of the nature of their activity. However, in Chile this consideration has been reconciled with the need to maintain justice in the field of labour and thus workers who may not go on strike settle disputes at the collective bargaining stage through arbitration which the employer may not refuse and to whose results he is bound.
.As regards the prohibition concerning contributions to trade union organisations from employers or foreign bodies, the Government points out that the trade union act comprises an adequate system of financing by means of ordinary and extraordinary contributions from its members which are automatically deducted from their remunerations. Trade union financing by undertakings and foreign bodies is prohibited. This is a basic premise of the regime of freely chosen membership which becomes effective only to the extent that the trade unions achieve their own goals by the diligent action of their leaders rather than on the basis of extraneous advantages such as those which would be possible through outside financing.Furthermore, in this way acts of interference on the part of the employer, who could discriminate in favour of the trade union of his choice or one which is amenable to his influence, may be avoided.
.The Committee notes that Act No.  of  December  places important restrictions on collective bargaining, in particular as regards the indexing of remunerations. In this respect, noting that both the Government and the complainants have drawn attention to the existence of serious difficulties in the economic field, the Committee would like to point out that if, for compelling reasons of national economic interest, a government considers that wage rates cannot be fixed by collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards [See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Canada-Quebec), paragraph .]. To this end, the Committee would like to stress that Act No.  does not establish a specific period of application and that none of its provisions makes it possible to suppose that it is a temporary act rather than one of an indeterminate duration. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not indicated whether measures have been taken to protect workers'. living standards. Therefore the Committee draws the attention of the, Government to the fact that the period of application of the, restrictions on collective bargaining as regards the indexing of wages established in Act No.  should not exceed a reasonable period of' time and that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.Furthermore the Committee notes that the Government states that the allegation concerning the suspension of wage indexing for workers in the public sector is incorrect since remunerations were increased by  per cent in  and will be further increased by  per cent in January  and that furthermore three bonuses equivalent to  per cent of salary have been awarded to public employees.
.As regards the strike prohibition in  undertakings, the Committee notes that according to the Government this is due to the prejudice which the holding of strikes in such undertakings would cause to the community. The Committee also observes that in the undertakings concerned collective bargaining disputes may be resolved through arbitration. The Committee has pointed out on a number of, occasions [See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), paragraph .] that, as one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational. interests, the right to strike may be denied or seriously; restricted only in public services or services essential in the strict sense of the term (those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). The Committee considers in this respect that some of the undertakings mentioned by the complainant in which strikes are prohibited do not appear to provide essential services in the sense expressed above. The Committee therefore draws the attention of the Government to the need to limit the list of undertakings in which strikes are prohibited (cf. Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) dated S August ) to those which provide essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.As regards the prohibition for trade unions to receive financial assistance from the undertakings to which their members belong, or from foreign natural or legal persons (Act No. ), the Committee considers that although the first prohibition is understandable from the point of view of the principle of the non-interference of employers and their organisations in workers' organisations, the second prohibition may place an important restriction on the right of trade union organisations to affiliate to higher level international organisations (federations and confederations) and to receive financial assistance from these organisations. The Committee asks the Government to take measures with a view to amending this provision.Allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders
.The complainants allege that on  September , following a demonstration held in the city of Concepcin to demand the return of Chilean exiles, Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo, leader of the Trade Union Association of Workers of Chile (AGECH) and Rend Carvajal Ziga, labour adviser of the coal workers' trade unions, were detained and falsely accused of having placed a fire bomb in the vicinity of the City Hall of Concepcin. Some days later Jos Ortz Aravena, President of the AGECH, was detained for  hours and tortured. According to the latter, Mrs. Darricarrere was subjected to physical ill-treatment.
.The complainants also allege that in November or December  the following trade union leaders were arrested. Ernesto Vega Alvarez, Domingo Tapia and Juan Sez, and in January , Lorenzo Boroa, Maria Luisa Traipe and Manuel Espinoza, who were also trade union leaders.
.The Government states that on  October  Mrs. Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo and Mr. Rend Carvajal Ziga were arrested on the orders of the Second Military Court of Concepcin, for having violated the act respecting the control",-1,1983,Chile
253,"of arms. The court proceeded to issue a resolution committing them for trial considering that there were justified grounds for believing that they had participated in the crime when they where caught in possession of explosives in the lavoratories of the municipal stadium of Concepcin. Mr. Rend Carvajal Ziga was released by order of the court in December .The Martial Court ordered the release of Mrs. Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo on  February . Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena, who is not president of the AGECH as the complainants incorrectly state, was arrested for carrying out clandestine political activities but he was released after the court took a statement from him.
.The Government adds that it has no information on the alleged detention of Ernesto Vega, Domingo Tapia and Maria Luisa Traipe and that Juan Sez and Lorenzo Boroa were detained and immediately released after verification of their domicile, for having actively participated in demonstrations to disturb the public peace and instigate disorder. Manuel Espinoza was arrested for having been caught in possession of small metal tacks which, when thrown in the streets prevent vehicles from passing by sticking to their tyres and bursting them. He was released after a statement had been taken and his domicile verified.
.The Committee observes that according to the statements of the Government Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena and Mrs. Maria Eugenia Darricarrere and Manuel Espinoza were arrested for acts which were not related to trade union activities. The Committee also notes that the Government states that it has no information on the alleged detention of Ernesto Vega, Diego Tapia and Maria Luisa Traipe. The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations of torture or physical ill-treatment suffered by Mrs. Maria Darricarrere and Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena. The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into these matters and to inform it of the results.
.As regards the arrest of Messrs. Juan Sez and Lorenzo Boroa, the Committee notes that, according to tile Government, these persons had participated actively in demonstrations to disturb the public peace and instigate disorder. The Committee regrets that tile Government has not given greater details on these demonstrations. However, since tile persons in question were immediately released :after verification of their domicile and Chat the alleged events date back to January , the Committee considers that this aspect of tile case calls for no further examination.Allegations concerning tile dismissal of trade union leaders and trade unionists
.The complainants allege that five trade union leaders of tile Celulosa Arauco undertaking (Messrs. Leopoldo Pinto, Eduardo Seplveda, Jaime Bohme, Jos Araneda Alarcn and Miguel Medina) were dismissed after having been accused of instigating a strike of five hours in September  in which  members of the first shift refused to start work. In the same way, in the Calzados Gino undertaking, two leaders of tile plant trade union Messrs. Jorge Venegas and Mauricio Rodrguez and two workers were dismissed for having refused to sign a document in support of a reduction in tile sales commissions which are part of tile salesmen's wages. Furthermore, tile owner of tile Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking dismissed tile trade union committee, composed of Sixto Walter Manrquez, Emeterio Gonzlez and Jos Rivera, just after tile establishment of the trade union, as well as  workers for having collaborated in setting up the trade union. The complainant states that tile trade union of this undertaking was set up because of irregularities committed by tile owner in carrying out labour legislation.
.The complainants also allege the dismissal of Efran Plaza and Pedro Gutirrez (president and vice-president of the Union of Building Workers, Engineers, Technicians and Administrators) in May , tile dismissal of Arsenio Angulo (national leader of tile Confederation of Gastronomic Workers) in June , tile dismissal of Enrique Morgado and Jorge Pulgar (president and secretary of tile Cristaleras Toro S.A. trade union) in August ; and the dismissal of three leaders of tile Croupiers' Trade Union of the casino of Via del Mar in February . In September  six leaders of General Motors allegedly ceased to be workers of the undertaking as a result of pressure brought to bear by the latter.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union leaders in the Celulosa Arauco y Constitucin undertaking, the Government states that on  September , this undertaking informed the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Arauco of the termination of the employment contracts of the trade union leaders of the Workers' Trade Union No.  of the Celulosa Arauco y Constitucin undertaking Messrs. Leopoldo del Carmen Pinto Arriagada, Eduardo Adolfo Seplveda da Cabrera, Miguel Enrique Medina Mendoza, Jos Toms Araneda Alarcn and Jaime Eduardo Bohme Barroso. The termination of their work contracts was due to their organisation of and participation in an illegal strike held on  September . The matter of dismissal was taken to the courts of justice by only Messrs. Leopoldo del Carmen Pinto Arriagada and Eduardo Adolfo Seplveda Cabrera, who reached an agreement with the undertaking (a copy of which is included by the Government) to settle the claim of unjustified dismissal out of court, whereby the undertaking was to pay Mr. Seplveda Cabrera the sum of ,. dollars and Mr. Pinto Arriagada the sum of ,. dollars. On  December ,  members of tile trade union requested that a date be set to elect a new trade union committee and on  January  the election was held resulting in tile appointment of a new trade union committee.
.As regards the dismissal by the undertaking Calzados Gino Ltda. of Messrs. Jorge Venegas and Mauricio Rodrguez and two other workers for having refused to agree to reductions in their sales commissions, according to information from the labour inspectorates of Santiago and Santiago Oriente, no complaints or denunciations have been made by workers or trade union leaders of the above-mentioned undertaking regarding dismissals or the reduction in their wages.
.As regards the Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking, the Government states that on  November , the trade union leaders Messrs. Emetero Gonzlez Guzmn, Sixto Walter Manrquez Contreras and Jos Arturo Rivero Ortz appealed to the Labour Inspectorate regarding their dismissal by their employer. On  November  a labour inspector was sent to the undertaking and proceeded to impose an administrative fine for the infraction in question. The trade union leader Mr. Sixto Walter Manrquez Contreras was reinstated on  March ; he is now working normally in the undertaking and he was fully compensated for the period between tile date of his dismissal and his reinstatement. Mr. Emeterio Gonzlez Guzmn was reinstated and was paid compensation for the period during which lie was dismissed; he worked in the undertaking for one week after which he did not return. As regards Mr. Jos Arturo Rivera Ortiz, although the employer offered to reinstate him in his workplace, it is known that he is working in an interprovincial transport company, as a result of which it has not been possible to locate him regarding his reinstatement in the Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking.
.The Government also states that it has no information on the alleged dismissal of Efran Plaza, Pedro Gutirrez, Arsenio Angulo, Enrique Morgado and Jorge Pulgar, and that labour legislation currently in force allows workers to appeal to the courts when they feel that they are affected by a measure of this kind. The Government reiterates this last statement regarding the alleged dismissal of leaders of the Croupiers' Trade Union and the General Motors Trade Union.
.As regards the dismissal of five trade union leaders in the Celulosa Arauco y Constitucin undertaking, the Committee notes that two of the dismissed leaders reached a financial agreement with the undertaking whereby the latter would pay certain benefits and the leaders would withdraw their action for reinstatement lodged before the courts. As regards the other three trade union leaders dismissed by the above-mentioned undertaking, although the Committee notes that the dismissal was the result of their organisation of and participation in an illegal strike and that the persons concerned did not take their case to court, it regrets that the Government has not indicated the motives for which the above-mentioned strike was declared illegal and that for this reason the Committee is unable to reach conclusions based on a full knowledge of the events.
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of two trade union leaders and two workers of the Calzados Gino undertaking for having refused to sign a document in support of a reduction in sales commissions, the Committee notes that according to the Government no denunciations or complaints were made regarding dismissals or the reduction of remunerations in the above-mentioned undertaking.
.The Committee notes that the labour inspectorate applied an administrative fine for the dismissal of the three trade union leaders of the Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking, that two of the leaders were reinstated and that the third was offered reinstatement. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not provided information on the dismissal of  other workers in the said undertaking. Therefore,",-1,1983,Chile
254,"given the fact that the complainants allege that these workers were dismissed for having collaborated in setting up a trade union within the undertaking, the Committee notes in general that no person should be dismissed or be subject to other prejudicial measures regarding employment for carrying out legal trade union activities.
.The Committee observes finally that with regard to the other alleged dismissals, the Government has stated that it has no information and that legislation allows workers who feel that they have been affected by a measure of this kind to appeal to the courts. In these circumstances, and since the complainants have provided no concrete information on the acts which allegedly led to the dismissals in question and in as far as such alleged dismissals occurred in any case more than one year ago, the Committee believes that these allegations call for no further examination.Allegation concerning the disqualification of a trade union leader
.The complainants allege the disqualification of Mr. Victor Mendoza Vjar as leader of Workers' Union No.  of the National Coal Company Enacar de Lota, contained in a resolution from the administrative authority dated  June , which gave no explanation for the disqualification.
.The Government states that, by resolution No.  dated  June , the Labour Directorate disqualified Mr. Victor Mendoza Vjar from his post of director of Workers' Union No.  of the National Coal Company for failing to comply with the provisions of section , para. , of Legislative Decree No. , which establishes that a trade union director must ""have a length of service as a member of the trade union, as indicated in its statutes, and which may not be less than six months, except in cases where the trade union has existed for a shorter period of time"". In fact, it was established that Mr. Mendoza Vjar had joined the union on  December  and that the trade union election was held on  March . As a consequence, Victor Mendoza had been a member of the above-mentioned trade union for just over three and a half months when he was elected its director. The administrative resolution was the subject of an appeal in the courts and to date no decision has been given since the claimant has not furnished the documents to support his claim.
.The Committee observes that the disqualification of Mr. Mendoza Vjar as a trade union leader was made on  June  by resolution of the Labour Directorate pursuant to section , para. , of Legislative Decree No.  which establishes as a requisite that any trade union leader must have a length of service as a member of the trade union of not less than six months. In this respect, the Committee would like to point out that this requisite supposes an important restriction of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom. Therefore, whilst it regrets the measure of disqualification as trade union leader applied to Mr. Mendoza Vjar on  June , the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to amending section , para. , of the legislative decree in order to guarantee fully the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.Allegation concerning the obstruction of a press conference
.The complainants allege that the judicial authorities erroneously dismissed an appeal which had been made against persons who prevented the leaders of four trade union organisations (Trade Union No.  of American Screw, S.A., Trade Union No.  of Laboratorio Chile, S.A., Trade Union No.  of Good Year, Planta Nylon, and the Industrial Assembly Inter-Undertaking Trade Union) from holding a press conference to provide information on the serious labour situation confronting workers and their trade union leaders.
.The Government states that the Ministry of the Interior has no information concerning alleged action to prevent the holding of a press conference.
.The Committee notes that the complainants have not indicated the date or place of the press conference to which they refer and that although they have pointed out that the judicial authorities rejected an appeal made against those persons who prevented the holding of the press conference, they have not enclosed a copy of the decision or given the grounds upon which the judicial decision was based. In these circumstances, and since the Government has stated that it has no information on the present allegation, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case requires no further examination.Allegation concerning the expulsion from the country of a trade union leader
.The complainants allege that the Government expelled Mr. Carlos Podlech, President of the Association of Farmers of Valdivia from the country, for statements which he had made concerning the serious situation confronting employers in this sector.
.The Government states that on  February  the measure against Mr. Carlos Podlech was lifted and he was permitted to return to the national territory.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not made observations on the alleged motives for the expulsion of Mr. Podlech from Chile (statements regarding the serious situation affecting employers in the agricultural sector). As a consequence, although it notes that on  February  the expulsion order against Mr. Podlech was revoked, the Committee notes that the expulsion from the country in which they live of trade union or employers' leaders for activities related to the exercise of their functions as such is not only contrary to human rights but is, furthermore, an interference in the activities of the organisation to which they belong.Allegation concerning the intimidation of a trade union leader
.The complainants allege that the Ministry of the interior lodged a complaint with the courts against Mr. Hernol Flores, President of the ANEF, for his having said that the Government knew who the assassins of Mr. Tucapel Jimnez, ex-President of the ANEF were. Following pressure and intimidation, Mr. Flores was obliged to withdraw his allegations and give explanations to the Government.
.The Government states that in October  the Court of Appeals of Santiago appointed one of its magistrates to prepare an indictment against Mr. Hernol Flores Opazo who, in a press conference given in the premises of the ANEF on  October had allegedly made offensive remarks against the Supreme Government, in violation of Act No. . After interviewing various persons present at the press conference and Mr. Flores himself, the magistrate concluded that there had been no violation of legislation in force. Mr. Flores, in any event was not deprived of his liberty and no measure of restriction is being applied against him.
.The Committee notes that the complainants have not indicated in what way pressures and intimidation were brought unless they mean the lodging of a complaint before the courts against the trade union leader Mr. Hernol Flores. The Committee also observes that the Government has indicated that an indictment was prepared against this trade union leader for having made remarks during a press conference which were offensive to the Supreme Government.
.In these circumstances, since no measure restricting the freedom of Mr. Flores was ordered and since the legal proceedings were concluded, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case requires no further examination.Allegations concerning the refusal of an undertaking to recognise two trade union leaders
.The complainants allege finally that the undertaking Good Year of Chile S.A.I.C. of Maip has paralysed collective bargaining by attempting to freeze wages between November  and November  and suppressing the indexing of wages and cash allowances. The arguments used by the undertaking are that two trade union representatives (Oscar Pino Morales and Pedro Bez Salinas) are ""undesirable and' highly argumentative persons"". Furthermore, according to the resolution of the Labour Inspectorate, these persons are not workers in the undertaking since they were dismissed in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No.  dated  July .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the period of application of the restrictions to collective bargaining as regards the indexing of wages, established by Act No. , should not exceed a reasonable time and should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.(b) The Committee considers that some of the undertakings in which strikes are prohibited do not seem to provide services that are essential in the strict sense of the term. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the need to limit the list of undertakings in which strikes are prohibited (cf. Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) of  August ) to those which provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).(c) The Committee considers that the prohibition for trade unions to receive financial aid from foreign natural or legal persons (Act No. ) may place an important limitation on the right of trade union organisations to affiliate",-1,1983,Chile
255,"to higher-level international organisations (federations and confederations), and to receive financial assistance from these organisations. The Committee asks the Government to take measures with a view to the amending of this provision.(d) The Committee points out in general that no person should be dismissed or subject to prejudicial measures regarding employment for carrying out legal trade union activities.(e) The Committee regrets the disqualification as a trade union leader of Mr. Mendoza Vjar on  June  in pursuance of section , para.  of Legislative Decree No. . The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to the amendment of this legal rule (which requires that a trade union leader must have a length of service as a member in the trade union of not less than six months), so as to guarantee fully the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.(f) The Committee notes that the measure of expulsion against the employers' leader Mr. Podlech was revoked on  February . The Committee stresses that the expulsion from the country in which they live of trade union or employers' leaders for activities related to the exercise of their functions as such is not only contrary to human rights but is, furthermore, an interference in the activities of the organisation to which they belong.(g) The Committee draws attention to the fact that the dismissal of a trade union leader or simply the fact that he leaves the work which he carried out in an undertaking should not affect his trade union status or functions. In this connection, the Committee regrets that in pursuance of section , para.  of Legislative Decree No.  (which requires that a trade union leader must have a length of service of not less than two years of continuous work in an undertaking) the dismissal of two trade union leaders on  July  should have led to their exclusion from negotiations on the draft collective agreement with the undertaking Good Year of Chile S.A.I.C. of Maip, presented on  September . The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to the amendment of section , para.  of Legislative Decree No.  in order to guarantee fully the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.(h) The Committee asks the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations of torture and physical ill-treatment of Mrs. Mara Darricarrere and Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena.(i) As regards the remaining allegations, the Committee considers that these do not call for further examination.",-1,1983,Chile
256,".The Committee examined this case at its session in November  and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )]. The Government subsequently sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements, in particular, that the trade union leaders and trade unionists arrested on the premises of the National Trade Union of Independent Craftsmen on  April  were released the same day and that the persons arrested for having taken part in the demonstrations on  May were immediately released as soon as they had proved their identity and confirmed their place of residence.
.The Committee notes that the Government cannot accept the principle whereby acts committed against legislation in force by persons holding the position of trade union leader cannot be put down by the authorities. In this respect, the Committee wishes to point out that its task, when allegations of measures to deprive trade union leaders of their freedom are submitted to it, consists of examining, on the basis of available information, whether such measures have been taken because of trade union activities in the true sense of the term. Although the bearer of a trade union appointment does not, by virtue of his position, have the right to transgress legal provisions in force, neither should the latter infringe upon the basic guarantees of freedom of association, nor sanction activities which, in accordance with generally recognised principles of freedom of association, should be considered as legal trade union activities.When allegations of measures taken against trade union leaders are submitted to the Committee, its role is basically limited to examining the above-mentioned issues.
.The Committee also notes that the Government denies that a group of individuals worked in co-operation with the police in breaking up a public gathering in the Plaza Artesanos on  May .With respect to the alleged violent actions of the above-mentioned group of individuals, the Committee notes that the Examining Magistrate having reached no conclusion whatsoever, declared a general dismissal of the proceedings. In view of the fact that the complainants alleged that some of the members of this group already acted in an almost identical way in the same place on  December , the Committee wishes to stress that events of this nature considerably hamper the exercise of trade union rights and expresses the hope that the authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent them from recurring in the future.
.Moreover, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the Committee lacks objectivity in its conclusions in its th Report based on information from the complainants that there was ""co-ordination"" between the police and a group of individuals. According to the Government, this seriously damages the honour of the Armed Forces and it asks what kind of proof is available to warrant such a conclusion. In this connection, the Committee draws the Government's attention to its first reply (see th Report, para. ) in which it did not deny the alleged co-ordination between the said group of individuals and the police, but limited itself to stating that. ""the courts were notified of these events; after carrying out a full investigation, they were unable, unfortunately, to obtain the expected positive results. The Government condemns the aforementioned acts of violence and declares that it will deal severely with those found responsible by the courts"". It therefore is understandable that in such circumstances the Committee, in its th Report, expressed ""its concern that, according to the complainants, a group of individuals were involved in violent action and coordinated with the police in breaking up a public meeting in the Plaza de Los Artesanos"". The Committee would stress that in its conclusion it expressed its concern over something reported by the complainants, which had not been denied by the Government, without deciding at any time that there had, in fact, been ""co-ordination"".In addition, in respect of this aspect of the case, the Committee made no definitive pronouncement as is indicated by the fact that it requested the Government to send it the judgments of the trial being held in relation with this group's activities. Therefore, it cannot he said that the Committee lacks objectivity on an issue concerning which it has made no decision while awaiting the receipt of additional information from the Government.
.With respect to the death of two persons during the National Protest Day of  May , the Committee notes that the Government denies that these deaths resulted from shots fired by members of the security forces and that those allegedly responsible for these acts have been discharged of any responsibility by the th Court of Criminal Investigation, which ruled that the case should be staved.
.The Committee notes that the Government categorically denies and rejects the Committee's conclusion in its th Report concerning the death of two persons during the National Protest Day o  May  and that it considers that the Committee has overstepped its functions since it judged and condemned as the authors of the two murders members of the Chilean security services, solely on the basis of the complainants' statements. The Government expresses its strongest protest against what it considers to be an intervention in aspects within the internal jurisdiction of the country which have no relation to trade union problems. In this respect, the Committee would point out that in the first reply given by the Government on this point (th Report, para. ), the Government did not deny that members of the Chilean security services may have been responsible for the death of two persons during the events which took place on  May , but merely limited itself to stating that the th Court of Criminal Investigation was looking into the responsibility of the alleged offenders. The Committee therefore concluded that the issue being heard before the th Court of Criminal Investigation was whether the officers in question were guilty by fault or negligence, and not the issue of whether they had been responsible for the deaths of the two persons, a point which the Committee considered evident given that the Government had not denied it expressly. The Committee would emphasise that the examination of allegations relating to the death of persons due to demonstrations which, according to the complainants, were of a trade union character, are not at all outside the Committee's competence in so far as the said demonstrations were allegedly trade union activities; therefore, there is no intervention in matters falling within the internal jurisdiction of the country.On the other hand, the Committee stresses that its conclusion in its th Report that it ""deplores the death of two persons during the National Protest Day of  May  as a result of shots fired by the Chilean security services"" in no way prejudges the existence of criminal responsibility or guilt on their part.
.With respect to the allegation that police repression on the National Protest Day of  May resulted in hundreds of arrests and dozens of wounded, the Committee notes that it appears from the Government's reply that this Protest Day was held for political reasons; furthermore, the Government cannot accept there is any mention of police repression because the alleged number of arrests and wounded was the outcome of the violence unleashed by the demonstrators (who erected barricades, burned tyres, stoned vehicles, assaulted the police, sabotaged electric cables and caused considerable damage to property).
.In these circumstances, since the Government states that the National Day of Protest of  May  degenerated into criminal actions against individuals and property and as the complainants merely point out - without giving further details - that the violent police repression resulted in hundreds of arrests and dozens of wounded, the Committee can only deplore the climate of violence in which the National Protest Day of  May  took place.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) With respect to the alleged violence of a group of individuals in breaking up a public demonstration in the Plaza Artesanos on  May , the, Committee notes that the Examining Magistrate did not reach any conclusions whatsoever and declared a general dismissal of the proceedings. The Committee takes note that the Government denies that the said group of individuals acted in co-operation with the police. The Committee wishes to stress that violence, such as that committed by the above-mentioned group, seriously hampers the exercise of trade union rights and it expresses the hope that the authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent them from recurring in the future.(b) With respect to the death of two persons during the National Protest Day of  May , the Committee notes that the Government denies that",-1,1983,Chile
257,"these deaths were the result of bullets fired by members of the security services and refers, in support of its statement, to a decision taken by the th Court of Criminal Investigation.(c) Finally, the Committee deplores the climate of violence in which the National Protest Day of  May  took place.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) of ,  and  May . The WFTU sent additional information in a communication dated  May ; the ICFTU did likewise in communications dated  and  May . The Government replied with two communications, dated  September and  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  April , the headquarters of the National Trade Union of Independent Craftsmen in Santiago was broken into by seven armed civilians without a warrant, who proceeded to arrest  union members who were meeting to prepare the forthcoming International Labour Day; those arrested included Mara Lenina del Canto and Beatriz Salas, leaders of the Manual Workers' Union in the Metropolitan area, Luis Fuentealba, member of the Executive of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS), Ricardo Das, member of the CNS National Youth Department and Richard Molina Morgado, employee at the Workers' Church Movement (Vicari Pastoral Obrera).
.The complainants allege that the authorities refused the Democratic Union of Workers permission to hold a public gathering to commemorate Labour Day in the Don Bosco hall; they also refused to grant permission to trade union organisations such as the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Council to hold a cultural event in the Plaza de los Artesanos in Santiago, although they had carried out the necessary formalities to obtain a permit.
.According to the complainants, there were many incidents throughout the country on  May, connected with the various events called by the Chilean Trade Union Movement, which were violently put down by the security forces and the police. For instance, the workers who had gathered peacefully in the Plaza de los Artesanos were violently repressed by police forces and para-military groups armed with blunt and sharp instruments, on the pretext that the meeting had been banned. In this particular case, the complainants point out that a group of between  and  civilians, armed with lassos with balls (bolas) and sharp instruments and working in co-operation with the uniformed police, proceeded to break up the peaceful meeting of workers by attacking them, as well as several journalists who were detained, beaten or assaulted. The complainants mention that this group had already intervened on  December of the previous year and that it was the object of an allegation contained in Case No.  being examined at the moment.
.According to the ICFTU,  workers were arrested, whereas the WFTU claim that the number arrested reached . These included Ricardo Caldern, member of the CNS Youth Department, Ral Areos, metallurgical trade union leader, who was also wounded, Reinaldo Vallejos and Arnaldo Collados, both theatre artists. Furthermore, many workers were wounded, including the doctor Manuel Almeyda - seriously injured - and the trade union leader and Vice-President of the Confederation of Metallurgical Workers, Manuel Arcos. The acting President of the Confederation of Building Workers, Sergio Troncoso, was also savagely attacked whilst he was giving a talk.
.Furthermore, the complainants allege that on  May, the Ministry of the Interior submitted a request to the Appeals Court that ten members of the Executive Committee of the Confederation of Copper Workers, accused of disturbing the public order, should be brought to trial for various violations of the State Security Act. The accused are: the President of the Confederation, Rodolfo Seguel Molina, and the trade union leaders Roberto Carvajal, Carolos Ogalde, Manuel Rodrguez, Luis Morgado, Ral Montecinos, Roberto Guerra, Rubn Rivera, Jos Prez and Luis Abarca Quinteros. The complainants claim that the charge was made because the Confederation of Copper Workers called a strike for  May  and then renounced it in favour of a National Protest Day. In connection with the protest of  May, the Ministry of the Interior also summoned the trade union leaders Hernol Flores, Eduardo Ros and Federico Mujica of the National Association of Employees of State Undertakings (ANEF), the Democratic Union of Workers (UDT) and the Confederation of Private Employees of Chile (CEPCH), respectively.
.The complainants point out that during the National Protest Day of  May, the Chilean security services caused the death of two people: Vctor Ren Rodrguez,  years of age, who died as a result of wounds received from a bullet fired from a car by several policemen who were confronting a group of demonstrators; Vctor Fuente Seplveda,  years of age, who died in the same way. Furthermore, the violent police repression ended in hundreds of arrests (more than  according to the WCL) and tens of wounded.
.Finally, the complainants allege that the State-run firm CODELCO lodged an appeal with the courts to remove trade union leaders working in various pits from office and to dismiss them. The complainants specifically refer to Jos Escobar, Ral Montecino, Sergio Barriga, Nelson Rivera and Sabino Pez (from the El Salvador pit), Sergio Neira, Jos Prez, Rafael Guitirrez and Ricardo Opazo (from the Andina pit), Ramiro Vargas, Carlos Ogalde, Fredy Hinojosa and Nicanor Araya (from the Chuquicamata pit), and Armando Garrido, Manuel Rodrguez, Eugenio Lpez and Rodolfo Seguel (from the El Teniente pit).
.With respect to the events which occurred on  May  in the Plaza de los Artesanos, the Government states that the public meeting had not been authorised by the administrative authorities, precisely to avoid disturbances in public law and order; furthermore, the self-proclaimed organisation, the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, had not wanted to set itself up in compliance with the law and therefore lacks the representativity to request permission to hold public meetings. If freedom of association is to be valid, it must respect legality; since the self-proclaimed co-ordinating council failed to do this, it is not an occupational workers' association and, as such, lacks the necessary representativity.
.Concerning the allegation that a group of civilians violently broke up an unauthorised public meeting on  May in the Plaza de los Artesanos, the Government states that the courts were notified of these events; after carrying out a full investigation, they were unable, unfortunately, to obtain the expected positive results. The Government condemns the aforementioned acts of violence' and declares that it will deal severely with those found responsible by the courts.
.The Government adds that Luis Fuentealba was arrested on  April  as he had been caught in the process of planning to subvert public order on  May. After giving evidence, he was released on  May. On  July , he was arrested for having infringed the State Security Act and brought before the court. The Appeals Court of Santiago appointed one of its members to set up an investigation, resulting in Lawsuit No. -, which was finally stayed and he was released. The Government points out that Mr. Fuentealba's arrest and prosecution were in no way related to his trade union activities or to his involvement in the ceremony of  May .
.With respect to the alleged arrest of  persons, the Government declares that this accusation is totally devoid of truth.
.Concerning the prosecution of four persons for their role in the events which occurred on  May , the Government states that the members of the Executive Committee of the Confederation of Copper Workers organised a national protest movement against the Government which included bringing to a halt or suspending public services, as well as production, transport and trade. The above-mentioned protest ended with various acts of vandalism, resulting in considerable damage to private property, grave disturbances in law and order and paralysed national activities. The Ministry of the interior, exercising one of the powers conferred upon it by section  of the State Security Act, in force since , requested the Appeals Court of Santiago to appoint one of its members to set up an investigation into these occurrences and penalise those allegedly responsible for having committed acts of violence aimed at disturbing public law and order and interfering with the normal running of national activities. The Court of Appeals of Santiago (a civil, ordinary court, independent of the Government), complied with this demand and appointed Hernn Cereceda Bravo as Public Prosecutor. The latter, after carrying out initial investigations, submitted the accused, Rodolfo Seguel Molina, Roberto Carvajal Mieres, Manuel Rodrguez Echeverri and Jos Prez Ahumada, to trial for having allegedly committed offences. Later, acting upon the defence counsel's request, he freed them on bail, which was also confirmed by the Court of Appeals. Nevertheless, on  September , as a proof of its good intentions, the Government waived",0,1983,Chile
258,"the lawsuit brought against the leaders of the Confederation of Copper Workers. On the same day, the Substitute Magistrate of the Court of Appeals declared a general dismissal of the proceedings.
.With respect to the allegation that members of the Chilean security services had caused the death of two people, including that of a minor of  years of age, Vctor Rodrguez Clis, during the events which occurred on  May , the Government states that the th Court of Criminal investigation is looking into the responsibility of the alleged offenders, as the mother of the deceased has submitted a complaint of homicidal offence. As a result, the ordinary system of justice will deliberate on this crime. The Government does not consider that this aspect of the case constitutes in any way an alleged violation of freedom of association.
.Concerning the dismissal of workers by the firm CODELCO, the Government points out that this firm had cancelled the labour contracts of various workers, including several trade union leaders, and that it had acted within the law. The Government declares that the persons concerned had brought an action against the firm, demanding that they be reinstated, and that the courts had not yet pronounced a sentence on the matter. However, the firm CODELCO, at the request of the Government and the trade union leaders, has agreed to set up committees to examine the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.The Government concludes by stating that the various aspects contained in this case do not constitute a violation of the freedom of association and that the various measures the authorities have been obliged to adopt are only intended to safeguard the peace and order within the country, in accordance with the Political Constitution of the Republic.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the allegations concern the breaking into a trade union's headquarters and the arrest of trade union leaders and trade unionists who were meeting there on the eve of  May , as well as the refusal to grant permission, both to the Democratic Union of Workers and the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS), to organise public events on  May; the allegations also concern the violent repressive measures taken against the workers who had congregated in the Place de los Artesanos to attend a public meeting of the CNS, measures which had been carried out by the police force in co-operation with the para-military group and which resulted in many persons being wounded and a considerable number of arrests, including also that of trade union leaders. The complainants also allege that the trade union leaders of the Confederation of Copper Workers had been brought to trial for having organised National Protest Day on  May ; furthermore, they allege the death of two persons as a result of shot wounds received from officers in the security services who were confronting a group of demonstrators during this day of protest.
.With respect to the breaking in of the headquarters of the National Trade Union of Independent Craftsmen on  April  by seven armed civilians without a warrant and the arrest of  members, including four trade union leaders, as they were meeting to prepare the International Labour Day, the Committee notes that the Government only referred to the arrest of the trade union leader Luis Fuentealba, who, it declared, had been caught on  April  in the process of inciting the subversion of public law and order on  May and that, once he had made statements, he was released on  May.' In this respect, the Committee regrets that this trade union leader had been held in detention for four days only to make statements. The Committee also regrets that the Government has not replied either to the allegation concerning the breaking in of the headquarters of the trade union in question or to that concerning the arrest of  trade union leaders and trade unionists. The Committee therefore draws the Government's attention to the fact that the right of the inviolability of union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities cannot enter such premises without having obtained a legal warrant to do so. It also draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or trade unionists for trade union activities, even if this is only for a short period, constitutes an infringement of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee asks the Government to inform it if the trade union leaders and trade unionists in question have already been released.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the authorities' refusal to allow public trade union meetings to be held on  May, especially the meeting called by the CNS in the Plaza de los Artesanos, the Committee notes that permission was refused on the grounds that it might disturb public law and order and that the CNS lacked the representativity to hold public meetings. In this respect, the Committee considers that as the CNS is an organisation which aims at promoting and defending workers' interests, it should enjoy the right to organise public meetings and demonstrations. In this context, the Committee wishes to point out that it itself has recognised the CNS as a trade union organisation on several occasions and declared its complaints receivable. On previous occasions, the Committee has expressed the opinion that if the authorities decide to ban a demonstration in order to avoid disturbances, they should strive, to reach an agreement with the organisers of the demonstration in order to allow it to be held in some other place where there would be no fear of disturbances.' As there is no evidence that the authorities held a dialogue of this nature with the organisers of the public demonstration (which, according to the complainants, also included trade union organisations independent from the CNS), the Committee considers that by not allowing the public demonstration to be held in the Plaza de los Artesanos on  May, the Government restricted trade union rights. Bearing in mind that the Government did not reply to the allegation concerning the refusal to grant the Democratic Union of Workers permission to hold another public meeting on  May, the Committee reiterates the above-mentioned principles and considerations.
.Concerning the repression of the public demonstration on  May in the Plaza de los Artesanos, the Committee deplores the serious physical assaults on workers, trade union leaders and journalists, some of who were seriously injured.
.The Committee expresses its concern that the Government acknowledges that a group of civilians took part in the violent breaking up of a public meeting on  May in the Plaza de los Artesanos, even more so in view of the fact that, according to the complainants, this para-military group acted in co-operation with the police and that members of the same group had already acted in the same way and in the same place on  December . The Committee notes that this case has been referred to the courts and requests the Government to send it the results of the trial held on this matter.
.Although the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the allegation that  persons had been arrested is totally devoid of truth, it observes that the Government gave no specific information on the number of arrested. In these circumstances, the Committee can only deplore that the exercise of the right to demonstrate, an essential component of trade union rights, was repressed by means of wide-scale arrests and serious physical assaults. The Committee requests the Government to inform it if the persons arrested for having taking part in the demonstrations on  May have already been released.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the trial of the leaders of the Confederation of Copper Workers for having organised and taken part in the National Protest Day on  May , the Committee further notes the Government's statements and especially observes that it had released those concerned on bail. The Committee notes that on  September , the Government withdrew the suit against them.
.The Committee deplores the death of two persons during the day of national protest as a result of shots fired by the Chilean security services. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the th Court of Criminal Investigation is looking into the responsibility of the presumed offenders and requests the Government to keep it informed on the results of the proceedings.
.The Committee regrets that the Government did not reply to the allegation that during the National Protest Day on  May , police repression resulted in hundreds of arrests and dozens of wounded. The Committee requests the Government to send its comments on this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) Concerning the allegation that the headquarters of the National Trade Union of Independent Craftsmen was broken into and that  trade union leaders and members had been arrested, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact",-1,1983,Chile
259,"that the right of the inviolability of union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities cannot enter such premises without having obtained a corresponding legal warrant. The Committee also points out to the Government that the arrest of trade union leaders and trade unionists for taking part in trade union activities, even for a short period, constitutes an infringement of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee asks the Government to inform it whether all the trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned by the complainants have already been released.(b) The committee considers that, by not allowing the public demonstration organised by the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body in the Plaza de los Artesanos on  May or the public meeting organised by the Democratic Union of Workers, the Government infringed trade union rights.(c) The Committee deplores that the exercise of the right to demonstrate was repressed on  May in the Plaza de los Artesanos, by means of wide-scale arrests and physical assaults on the workers and trade union leaders. While regretting that the demonstrators had been physically assaulted, the Committee expresses its concern that, according to the complainants, a group of civilians were involved in violent action and co-ordinated with the police in breaking up a public meeting in the Plaza de los Artesanos. The Committee requests the Government to send it the judgements of the' trial being held in relation with this group's activities.(d) The Committee requests the Government to inform it whether those persons arrested for having taken part in the demonstrations on  May have been released.(e) With respect to the allegation concerning the trial of the leaders of the Confederation of Copper Workers for having organised and taken part in a National Protest Day on  May , the Committee notes the Government's statements and specifically observes that those concerned were released on bail. The Committee notes nevertheless that on  September , the Government withdrew the suit brought against them.(f) The Committee deplores the death of two persons during the National Protest Day as a result of shots fired by the Chilean Security Services. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the judgement of the case being conducted at present.(g) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government did not reply to the allegation that police repression on the National Protest Day of  May  resulted in hundreds of arrests and dozens of wounded.

260,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  April . The Government's reply communications of  and  May and  September .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU alleges that, on  March , at the time the new school year was announced, the Official Gazette published a decision of the Ministry of the Economy arbitrarily revoking the legal personality of the Professional Association of Educators of Chile (AGECH) for alleged violations of legal provisions, without giving the association any opportunity to defend itself and without stating the grounds for the revocation. The complainant adds that the AGECH has never violated the law, and that it must be presumed that the sole reason for revocation of the legal personality of AGECH is its opposition to the educational and labour policy of the Government.
.The complainant further states that the dissolution of the AGECH by decree comes at a time when teachers are facing serious problems of lack of job security, low pay, progressive reductions in vacation time, increased dismissals and growing unemployment in the profession.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that, by Resolution No.  of  January , published in the Official Gazette of  March , the Ministry of the Economy, Development and Reconstruction, by virtue of the laws applicable to serious violations of legal, regulatory and statutory provisions by occupational associations, revoked the legal personality of the Professional Association of Educators of Chile (AGECH). The grounds for taking this measure were the fact that the Association was found to be engaged in political activities, in express breach of section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  which prohibits occupational associations from engaging in this type of activity. The Government indicates that the AGECH leadership appealed the revocation to the courts.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that on  May  the court of first instance cancelled Resolution No.  of  January  revoking the legal personality of the AGECH. In its communication of  September , the Government sends a copy of the aforementioned decision which is now definitive since the Ministry of Economy, Development and Reconstruction made no appeal against it within the prescribed legal period.
.The Committee takes note of the allegations of the complainant relative to the revocation by administrative authority of the legal personality of the Professional Association of Educators of Chile (AGECH), and of the Government's reply.
.The Committee takes particular note that the court of first instance, in a decision of  May , cancelled the resolution of the Ministry of the Economy, Development and Reconstruction revoking the legal personality of the AGECH, but observes that this ministerial decision was enforceable as from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette. In this respect, the Committee can only regret that the Government violated the principle of freedom of association according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to dissolution by administrative authority, or to any other type of administrative measures producing the same result. In this connection, the Committee wishes to draw to the Government's attention that, in order to guarantee the aforesaid principle, and consequently the rights of defence, it is not sufficient for the laws to confer upon the trade union organisation concerned the right to appeal to the courts against a decision of dissolution or revocation of its legal personality. It is also necessary for the appeal procedure provided under the law to have a suspensive effect so that such measures can enter into force only after a period of time provided for under the law has elapsed without an appeal having been filed, or when the decision in question has been upheld by the courts. The Committee further observes that the grounds for revoking the legal personality of AGECH were that it was found to be engaged in political activities contrary to the provisions of section  of Legislative Decree No.  of . In this respect, the Committee recalls that provisions which produce a general prohibition of political activities of trade unions for the promotion of their specific objectives are contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation so that revocation of the legal personality of occupational associations which produces effects similar to those of dissolution - can be effected only by the courts, and to remove the general prohibition of political activities of occupational associations so that they may, if they wish, engage in political activities relating to the promotion of their trade union objectives.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee regrets that the Government violated freedom of association in revoking the legal personality of the AGECH by administrative action as it is entitled to do under the legislation in force - although it notes that, following an appeal filed by the AGECH leadership, the courts cancelled the aforesaid revocation.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle of freedom of association according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to dissolution by administrative authority or to any other type of administrative measures producing the same result.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend its legislation so that revocation of the legal personality of occupational associations can be effected only by the courts. It also requests the Government to remove the general prohibition of political activities of occupational associations so that they may, if they wish, engage in political activities relating to the promotion of their trade union objectives.",-1,1983,Chile
261,".The complaint of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) is contained in a communication dated  March . The ICFTU sent additional information in a communication of  May . The Government replied in communications dated  May and  September .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU alleges that in the early morning of  March  (day of public protest against unemployment and the lack of economic and social improvements), armed members of the National Information Agency (CNI) arrested, under Executive Decree No.  of  March,  persons including the trade unionists Reinaldo Flores del Pino, Alejandro Wladimir Cisterns Canales (former trade union leader in the textile undertaking ""Yarrur""), Jos Enrquez Nuez Estrella (member of the Youth Department of the Metallurgical Confederation), Jos Ramn Avello Soto (Chairman of the San Juan Dockyard Trade Union in charge of educational activities at the Metallurgical Confederation and Chairman of the Youth Department of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body) and Ricardo Fernndez Riquelme (Vice-Chairman of the Building Workers' Trade Union in the city of Concepcin). According to the complainant, arrests were made in some cases without an arrest warrant being produced and those concerned were required to sign documents in which only their name was listed. The above-mentioned trade unionists, with the exception of Reinaldo Flores who was released on  March , were banished on  March  to Pisagua. Furthermore, Ricardo Fernndez Riquelme had received blows during his arrest and at the police station, which resulted in bruises on his right shoulder and a scalp wound.
.The complainant further alleges that on  March , , persons were arrested in the centre of Santiago,  in Valparaiso and  in Concepcin; all were accused of having taken part in a protest march against unemployment and the lack of economic and social improvements. The complainant points out that, since early in the morning, police forces had already taken over the centre of Santiago armed with water cannon and that the carabineros had been extremely violent when making arrests. Out of the  persons arrested on  March in Santiago, one was released on the following day and  were released on  March; the remaining  persons were detained at the First Commissariat and banished to Pisagua on  March upon an order, from the Ministry of the Interior. Those persons detained in Valparaiso were released between  and  March with the exception of three, who were banished to Pisagua. The complainant encloses a report drawn up by a group of doctors on the  persons banished to Pisagua upon an order from the Ministry of the Interior under article  of the new Constitution, where they spent  days. According to the above-mentioned report,  out of the  persons banished were arrested at their homes in the early morning of  March  by members of the CNI and transferred to establishments belonging to this unit, where they remained six days before being finally transferred to Pisagua. These persons - according to the report - were subjected to various methods of torture during lengthy sessions, such as immersion or the application of electric shock treatment, preceded by intimidation, threats and interrogations. They were also subjected to sexual harassment. The  remaining persons banished were arrested by carabineros and harshly beaten. They showed evidence of haematomas, bruises and grazes. The building in which they were lodged lacked the necessary hygienic conditions.
.In its communications of  May and  September , the Government states that on  March , a group of persons caused various disturbances on the public thoroughfare, blocking the passage of passing vehicles and pedestrians, hurling insults at the authorities and throwing flying objects at the police. The latter, acting in the interest of public order and safety and the protection of citizens' peace and calm, proceeded to put a stop to these excesses and managed to detain some of the persons involved. The authorities of the Interior Government, acting in accordance with the legal provisions in force, assigned those arrested to forced residence in two localities in the north of the country. On Wednesday  June , the detainees were released from forced residence ahead of time and returned to their places of origin.
.The Government also states that there are no records on the  trade unionists who, according to the complainant organisation, had allegedly been abducted from their homes.
.The Government adds that those persons mentioned in the complaint, amongst whom were several students who had been described as ""trade unionists"", were not arrested either in this alleged capacity or for activities connected with their presumed trade union activities but because they had been causing politically-motivated disturbances, aimed at subverting law and order.
.Furthermore, the Government states that it rejects the accusations that these persons had been subjected to violence and torture, claiming that they have no basis whatsoever and constitute an unacceptable falsehood.
.The Government encloses a press cutting in which it is stated that the  persons banished (giving their names) to Pisagua and Camia, accused of having repeatedly taken part in subversive activities contrary to the public order, were released on  June . The same source of information points out that the banished persons were released one week before completing the  days' sentence they had been given.
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleged the arrest of  persons, including several trade union leaders and trade unionists, on  March , a day of public protest against unemployment and the lack of economic and social improvements, during which public demonstrations were held in the cities of Santiago, Valparaiso and Concepcon. The complainant also alleged that several detainees were banished to Pisagua and subjected to torture, ill-treatment and received injuries.
.The Committee notes first of all that the Government's reply merely gives information on the  persons banished to Pisagua and Camia for  days and does not refer at all to the other arrests made on  March  which, according to the complainant, involved  persons who were later released between  and  March . In this respect, bearing in mind that there were trade union leaders and trade unionists amongst those arrested on  March  and that the demonstration was held in the defence of workers' interests, the Committee considers that, although the complainant has not given all the details which might have been desired, there is enough evidence to consider these demonstrations as trade union activities, irrespective of whether non-trade union organisations played a role of primary or secondary importance in the planning and carrying out of these demonstrations. In these circumstances, the Committee deplores the Government's failure to supply information on the reasons for the alleged arrest of  persons. The Committee regrets these arrests even more in view of the fact that there is nothing to suggest that the judicial authorities upheld any charges whatsoever against those concerned.
.With respect to the  persons who were first arrested and then banished for  days to the localities of Pisagua and Camia, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the police had arrested these persons in the interest of safeguarding public law and safety and protecting social peace and calm as, on  March , a group of people were causing disturbances on the public thoroughfare, blocking the passage of passing vehicles and pedestrians, hurling insults at the authorities and throwing flying objects at the police. The Committee also notes that the Government authorities, acting in accordance with the legal provisions in force, assigned this group of persons to forced residence in two localities in the north of the country. The Committee further notes that, according to the Government, there were several students amongst those arrested and that those persons described as ""trade unionists"" by the complainant organisation were not arrested either in this capacity or for actions connected with their presumed trade union activities but because they had caused politically-motivated disturbances aimed at subverting law and order.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government's reply and the information submitted by the complainant organisation do not correspond; for example, according to the latter, several trade union leaders and trade unionists (whose names are given), who were banished to Pisagua on  March  were arrested at their homes in the early morning of  March, that is, before they could have taken part in any demonstration whatsoever. Furthermore, the Committee notes that although the Government has given a general description of the type of activities it accuses the  persons in question of having committed, which infringed public order, physical integrity and private property, it did not give details of the charges with which each one is to be individually accused, especially those attributed to the trade union leaders; the Government only stated that they were causing disturbances for political",0,1983,Chile
262,"reasons.
.In these circumstances, the Committee must emphatically point out to the Government that measures depriving persons of their freedom and imposing sanctions such as banishment for trade union reasons constitute violations of the principles of freedom of association and it considers it unacceptable that sanctions of this nature should be imposed by administrative action.
.With respect to the allegations of ill-treatment, injuries and torture inflicted on the  banished persons who, according to the complainant, had been arrested at their homes on  March  (including trade union leaders) and the physical assaults to which these banished persons were subjected while in detention, the Committee considers inadequate the Government's brief statement that such allegations have no basis whatsoever and constitute an unacceptable falsehood. While expressing its grave concern at these allegations, the Committee, as it has done on previous occasions when similar cases have been referred to it, asks the Government to undertake a prompt and independent legal investigation of the alleged cases of torture with a view to elucidating the facts in full, to identifying the persons responsible and to taking proceedings against them, l as well as to keep it informed of the outcome of its investigations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that the persons arrested ( according to the complainant) on a ""day of protest against unemployment and the lack of economic and social improvements"" ( March ), were released and that the period of banishment imposed on  of those persons has now come to an end. All therefore now enjoy complete freedom.(b) With respect to the arrest and subsequent banishment of  persons, including several trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee emphatically points out to the Government that measures depriving persons of their freedom and imposing sanctions such as banishment for trade union reasons constitute violations of the principles of freedom of association, and it considers it unacceptable that sanctions of this nature are imposed by administrative action.(c) As regards the arrest of the remaining  persons, the Committee regrets that the Government did not supply information as to the reasons for their arrest. The Committee deplores these arrests, even more so in view of the fact that there is no evidence to show that the judicial authorities upheld any charges whatsoever against those concerned.(d) With respect to the allegations of ill-treatment, injuries and torture inflicted in particular on trade union leaders, the Committee, while expressing its grave concern at these allegations, requests the Government to carry out a prompt and independent legal investigation of the alleged cases of torture with a view to elucidating the facts in full, to identifying the persons responsible and taking proceedings against them, as well as to keep it informed of the outcome of its investigations.",1,1983,Chile
263,".The complaints appear in communications from the International Union of Metallurgy Trade Unions (UISMETAL), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated ,  and  March , respectively. The Government replied in a communication of  May .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.UISMETAL, the ICFTU and the WFTU allege that on  March  the police forcibly entered the headquarters of the Trade Union Confederation of Metallurgy Workers (CONSTRAMET), removed all the equipment and documents of that organisation, and the following day arrested its President, Ricardo Lecaros.
.The ICFTU adds in its communication of  March  that Mr. Lecaros is still being held in custody by the Chilean police, although no charges have been filed against him. The ICFTU further indicates that in  Mr. Lecaros, together with other trade unionists, was tried, convicted and sentenced to  days in prison for organising the Confederation.
.Finally, according to the WFTU, Jos Enrique Muoz and Ramn Avello, also CONSTRAMET leaders, were arrested on  March  and their present whereabouts are unknown.
.The Government states that on  March , Ricardo Lecaros Gonzlez, President of the Trade Union Confederation of Metallurgy Trade Unions, was arrested and turned over to the courts. The grounds for his arrest were the discovery at Confederation headquarters of packages containing thousands of pamphlets with texts contrary to public order and security.
.The Government adds that the Appeals Court of Santiago appointed an examining magistrate to determine whether a crime had been committed and to assign responsibility therefore. Having examined the facts and heard the testimony of the accused, the magistrate ruled that he bore no responsibility for the possible distribution of the pamphlets, and ordered his immediate and unconditional release. It is important to note that the existence of the pamphlets were never at issue, only their presumed distribution, of which Mr. Lecaros was cleared of any responsibility.
.Finally, the Government states that Messrs. Jos Enrique Muoz and Ramn Avello, mentioned in the communication of the World Federation of Trade Unions, are not in custody.
.The Committee notes that the allegations presented in the present case concern the arrest of three CONSTRAMET trade union leaders, and forcible entry at CONSTRAMET headquarters with confiscation of equipment and documents.
.As regards the arrest of the CONSTRAMET trade union leaders, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, Jos Enrique Muoz is not in custody. In view of the lack of precise and detailed information supplied by the complainants the Committee can only take note of this statement. The Committee further notes that the grounds for the arrest of Ricardo Lecaros were the discovery at CONSTRAMET headquarters of thousands of pamphlets with texts contrary to public order and security, but that the court, having examined the facts and heard the testimony of this trade union leader, ruled that he bore no responsibility for possible distribution of the pamphlets, and ordered his unconditional release.
.In these circumstances, since no charges were upheld against Mr. Lecaros by the courts, the Committee regrets that this labour leader was held in custody for several days. The Committee draws to the Government's attention the fact that measures of preventive detention taken against trade union leaders constitute an inadmissible interference in trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not replied to the allegations of forcible entry and confiscation of equipment and documents at CONSTRAMET headquarters. The Committee requests the Government to submit its observations on those issues.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions;(a) In the absence of more precise and detailed information from the complainants, the Committee can only note that, according to the Government, Mr. Jos Enrique Muoz is not in custody.(b) The Committee regrets that the trade union leader, Mr. Lecaros, now released, was held in custody for several days.(c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of preventive detention taken against trade union leaders constitute an inadmissible interference in trade union activities.(d) The Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegations regarding the forcible entry and the confiscation of equipment and documents at the CONSTRAMET headquarters.",0,1983,Chile
264,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) of  February . The Government replied in communications of  May and  August .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the WFTU alleges the arrest of Messrs. Luis Caro Molina, Juan Cunuecn and Lino Contreras Espinoza, leaders of the Colbn-Machicura Hydroelectric Complex Construction Union, who are currently in the custody of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals.
.According to the WFTU, the three leaders were arrested in Maip while soliciting trade union support for the strike in which the workers of the Colbn-Machicura Hydroelectric Complex have been engaged for over a month. The WFTU indicates that it fears for the physical well-being and the life of the three leaders.
.The Government states in its communication of  May  that on  February  Messrs. Luis Rafael Caro Molina, Juan Cunuecn Alvarez and Lino Alberto Contreras Espinoza, were arrested and turned over to the courts on charges of violating Act No. . on State Security. According to the Government, there is no proof that these persons were trade union leaders of the Colbn-Machicura Hydroelectric Complex Construction Union.
.The Government adds that the Court of Appeals of Santiago appointed one of its members as examining magistrate to investigate the facts and determine responsibility therefore. The examining magistrate issued an indictment by which, having questioned the accused, he committed them for trial on the grounds that the existence of the crime under investigation had been established and that there was sufficient evidence of involvement of the accused as authors, accomplices or accessories after the fact. The defence appealed to a higher court which, having considered the plea, upheld the indictment issued by the magistrate.
.The Government further indicates that, notwithstanding the indictment of the persons concerned, the judge in charge of the case released them on bail on  February . Consequently, the complainant's allegation that the defendants are in jail is not accurate.
.In its communication of  August  the Government indicates that on  July  the Supreme Court upheld an appeal brought by the defence stating that the existence of the offences in question had not been proved. Consequently, the charges against those concerned have been dropped and they enjoy complete freedom.
.The Committee notes that the allegations refer to the arrest on  February  of three leaders of the Colbn-Machicura Hydroelectric Complex Construction Union while soliciting trade union support for the strike of the workers of the hydroelectric complex.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements and, in particular, that the examining magistrate in the case against the aforesaid persons released them on bail on  February  and committed them for trial on the grounds that the existence of crimes in violation of Act No. . on State Security had been established and there was sufficient evidence that the accused had taken part in such crimes. The Committee also notes that since  July  those concerned have enjoyed complete freedom as the Supreme Court found that there was no proof of the existence of the crimes of which these persons had been charged.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government has not indicated the specific acts of which the three leaders of the Colbn-Machicura Hydroelectric Complex Construction Union were accused, whereas the complainant organisation has indicated that the arrests were related to the conduct of trade union activities (seeking trade union support for a strike). The Committee also notes that Act No. ., the basis for the charges, contains penal provisions relating to acts such as paralysing electrical, water and similar services, or unlawful work stoppages and strikes in public services or utilities which upset public order or disrupt public utilities or services the functioning of which is required by law or damage any essential industries.
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that one of the bases of the principles of freedom of association is that there should be no recourse to measures depriving an individual of his liberty for the mere fact of organising or participating in a peaceful strike. Furthermore, the imposition of penal sanctions for such strikes is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.)
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that the union leaders Luis Caro, Juan Cunuecn and Lino Contreras, who were detained between  and  February , have been released in full freedom due to a decision by the judiciary that there was no proof as to the existence of the crimes of which they had been charged. The Committee notes that the law on which the charges against them were based imposes penal sanctions for the carrying out of certain trade union activities which is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that no one should be deprived of liberty or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organising or participating in a peaceful strike.",0,1983,Chile
265,".The complainants allege that some of the legislative provisions in force are contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. Thus, Act No.  dated  December  prescribes that in collective agreements concluded after this date, the employer may offer the same conditions of work existing on  December  without any subsequent readjustability. In this way Act No.  allows employers to prevent not only the readjustment of workers' wages when negotiations are initiated but also all future readjustments. This regulation is issued at a time when inflation for the coming year is expected to reach  per cent and is compounded by the fact that the minimum duration of a collective agreement is two years. In the same way, the salaries of public employees have been frozen since August  in pursuance of Decree No.  of that year.
.Likewise, Act No.  dated  December  prohibits trade unions from receiving financial aid from the undertakings to which their members belong as well as from foreign natural or legal persons; in the event of infringement provision is made for the application of penal sanctions and the reimbursement of the amounts unlawfully received. Furthermore, in the Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) of  August , the Government published a list of  undertakings whose workers may negotiate but not go on strike, essentially because such undertakings are strategic establishments for national defence and security. These include the following undertakings; CODELCO (copper mining), Ferrocarriles del Estado (railways), Compaa de Telfonos (telephones), ENTEL, SNAP (petroleum), LAN (air transport), CASCO (gas), Empresa Nacional de Explosivos (explosives), ENDESA (electricity), CHILECTRA and Banco del Estado (State bank).
.The Government states that the Constitutional Court has ruled that Act No.  of , which amends Legislative Decree No.  respecting contracts of work and Legislative Decree No.  respecting collective bargaining conforms to the law. This act was issued on the basis of considerations regarding the economic recession affecting all countries. In the present crisis, the country has not; been able to escape this recession and thus a system of automatic wage indexing would seriously compromise employment. The act had to take realistic account of this situation so as to avoid creating greater, unemployment.
.The Government states that the allegation concerning the;, suspension of readjustment of wages in the public sector is incorrect since remunerations were increased by  per cent in ; moreover, they will be further increased from  January  by  per cent. In addition to the above-mentioned increases, three bonuses equivalent to  per cent of salary have been granted to public employees; two of these bonuses have already been paid and the third was due in November .
.As regards workers who do not enjoy the right to strike, the Government states that, as in all other countries, undertakings exist in Chile in which workers may not strike because of the prejudice which this would cause to the community arising out of the nature of their activity. However, in Chile this consideration has been reconciled with the need to maintain justice in the field of labour and thus workers who may not go on strike settle disputes at the collective bargaining stage through arbitration which the employer may not refuse and to whose results he is bound.
.As regards the prohibition concerning contributions to trade union organisations from employers or foreign bodies, the Government points out that the trade union act comprises an adequate system of financing by means of ordinary and extraordinary contributions from its members which are automatically deducted from their remunerations. Trade union financing by undertakings and foreign bodies is prohibited. This is a basic premise of the regime of freely chosen membership which becomes effective only to the extent that the trade unions achieve their own goals by the diligent action of their leaders rather than on the basis of extraneous advantages such as those which would be possible through outside financing.Furthermore, in this way acts of interference on the part of the employer, who could discriminate in favour of the trade union of his choice or one which is amenable to his influence, may be avoided.
.The Committee notes that Act No.  of  December  places important restrictions on collective bargaining, in particular as regards the indexing of remunerations. In this respect, noting that both the Government and the complainants have drawn attention to the existence of serious difficulties in the economic field, the Committee would like to point out that if, for compelling reasons of national economic interest, a government considers that wage rates cannot be fixed by collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period and that it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards [See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Canada-Quebec), paragraph .]. To this end, the Committee would like to stress that Act No.  does not establish a specific period of application and that none of its provisions makes it possible to suppose that it is a temporary act rather than one of an indeterminate duration. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not indicated whether measures have been taken to protect workers'. living standards. Therefore the Committee draws the attention of the, Government to the fact that the period of application of the, restrictions on collective bargaining as regards the indexing of wages established in Act No.  should not exceed a reasonable period of' time and that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.Furthermore the Committee notes that the Government states that the allegation concerning the suspension of wage indexing for workers in the public sector is incorrect since remunerations were increased by  per cent in  and will be further increased by  per cent in January  and that furthermore three bonuses equivalent to  per cent of salary have been awarded to public employees.
.As regards the strike prohibition in  undertakings, the Committee notes that according to the Government this is due to the prejudice which the holding of strikes in such undertakings would cause to the community. The Committee also observes that in the undertakings concerned collective bargaining disputes may be resolved through arbitration. The Committee has pointed out on a number of, occasions [See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), paragraph .] that, as one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational. interests, the right to strike may be denied or seriously; restricted only in public services or services essential in the strict sense of the term (those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). The Committee considers in this respect that some of the undertakings mentioned by the complainant in which strikes are prohibited do not appear to provide essential services in the sense expressed above. The Committee therefore draws the attention of the Government to the need to limit the list of undertakings in which strikes are prohibited (cf. Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) dated S August ) to those which provide essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.As regards the prohibition for trade unions to receive financial assistance from the undertakings to which their members belong, or from foreign natural or legal persons (Act No. ), the Committee considers that although the first prohibition is understandable from the point of view of the principle of the non-interference of employers and their organisations in workers' organisations, the second prohibition may place an important restriction on the right of trade union organisations to affiliate to higher level international organisations (federations and confederations) and to receive financial assistance from these organisations. The Committee asks the Government to take measures with a view to amending this provision.Allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders
.The complainants allege that on  September , following a demonstration held in the city of Concepcin to demand the return of Chilean exiles, Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo, leader of the Trade Union Association of Workers of Chile (AGECH) and Rend Carvajal Ziga, labour adviser of the coal workers' trade unions, were detained and falsely accused of having placed a fire bomb in the vicinity of the City Hall of Concepcin. Some days later Jos Ortz Aravena, President of the AGECH, was detained for  hours and tortured. According to the latter, Mrs. Darricarrere was subjected to physical ill-treatment.
.The complainants also allege that in November or December  the following trade union leaders were arrested. Ernesto Vega Alvarez, Domingo Tapia and Juan Sez, and in January , Lorenzo Boroa, Maria Luisa Traipe and Manuel Espinoza, who were also trade union leaders.
.The Government states that on  October  Mrs. Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo and Mr. Rend Carvajal Ziga were arrested on the orders of the Second Military Court of Concepcin, for having violated the act respecting the control",-1,1983,Chile
266,"of arms. The court proceeded to issue a resolution committing them for trial considering that there were justified grounds for believing that they had participated in the crime when they where caught in possession of explosives in the lavoratories of the municipal stadium of Concepcin. Mr. Rend Carvajal Ziga was released by order of the court in December .The Martial Court ordered the release of Mrs. Maria Eugenia Darricarrere Andreo on  February . Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena, who is not president of the AGECH as the complainants incorrectly state, was arrested for carrying out clandestine political activities but he was released after the court took a statement from him.
.The Government adds that it has no information on the alleged detention of Ernesto Vega, Domingo Tapia and Maria Luisa Traipe and that Juan Sez and Lorenzo Boroa were detained and immediately released after verification of their domicile, for having actively participated in demonstrations to disturb the public peace and instigate disorder. Manuel Espinoza was arrested for having been caught in possession of small metal tacks which, when thrown in the streets prevent vehicles from passing by sticking to their tyres and bursting them. He was released after a statement had been taken and his domicile verified.
.The Committee observes that according to the statements of the Government Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena and Mrs. Maria Eugenia Darricarrere and Manuel Espinoza were arrested for acts which were not related to trade union activities. The Committee also notes that the Government states that it has no information on the alleged detention of Ernesto Vega, Diego Tapia and Maria Luisa Traipe. The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations of torture or physical ill-treatment suffered by Mrs. Maria Darricarrere and Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena. The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into these matters and to inform it of the results.
.As regards the arrest of Messrs. Juan Sez and Lorenzo Boroa, the Committee notes that, according to tile Government, these persons had participated actively in demonstrations to disturb the public peace and instigate disorder. The Committee regrets that tile Government has not given greater details on these demonstrations. However, since tile persons in question were immediately released :after verification of their domicile and Chat the alleged events date back to January , the Committee considers that this aspect of tile case calls for no further examination.Allegations concerning tile dismissal of trade union leaders and trade unionists
.The complainants allege that five trade union leaders of tile Celulosa Arauco undertaking (Messrs. Leopoldo Pinto, Eduardo Seplveda, Jaime Bohme, Jos Araneda Alarcn and Miguel Medina) were dismissed after having been accused of instigating a strike of five hours in September  in which  members of the first shift refused to start work. In the same way, in the Calzados Gino undertaking, two leaders of tile plant trade union Messrs. Jorge Venegas and Mauricio Rodrguez and two workers were dismissed for having refused to sign a document in support of a reduction in tile sales commissions which are part of tile salesmen's wages. Furthermore, tile owner of tile Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking dismissed tile trade union committee, composed of Sixto Walter Manrquez, Emeterio Gonzlez and Jos Rivera, just after tile establishment of the trade union, as well as  workers for having collaborated in setting up the trade union. The complainant states that tile trade union of this undertaking was set up because of irregularities committed by tile owner in carrying out labour legislation.
.The complainants also allege the dismissal of Efran Plaza and Pedro Gutirrez (president and vice-president of the Union of Building Workers, Engineers, Technicians and Administrators) in May , tile dismissal of Arsenio Angulo (national leader of tile Confederation of Gastronomic Workers) in June , tile dismissal of Enrique Morgado and Jorge Pulgar (president and secretary of tile Cristaleras Toro S.A. trade union) in August ; and the dismissal of three leaders of tile Croupiers' Trade Union of the casino of Via del Mar in February . In September  six leaders of General Motors allegedly ceased to be workers of the undertaking as a result of pressure brought to bear by the latter.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union leaders in the Celulosa Arauco y Constitucin undertaking, the Government states that on  September , this undertaking informed the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Arauco of the termination of the employment contracts of the trade union leaders of the Workers' Trade Union No.  of the Celulosa Arauco y Constitucin undertaking Messrs. Leopoldo del Carmen Pinto Arriagada, Eduardo Adolfo Seplveda da Cabrera, Miguel Enrique Medina Mendoza, Jos Toms Araneda Alarcn and Jaime Eduardo Bohme Barroso. The termination of their work contracts was due to their organisation of and participation in an illegal strike held on  September . The matter of dismissal was taken to the courts of justice by only Messrs. Leopoldo del Carmen Pinto Arriagada and Eduardo Adolfo Seplveda Cabrera, who reached an agreement with the undertaking (a copy of which is included by the Government) to settle the claim of unjustified dismissal out of court, whereby the undertaking was to pay Mr. Seplveda Cabrera the sum of ,. dollars and Mr. Pinto Arriagada the sum of ,. dollars. On  December ,  members of tile trade union requested that a date be set to elect a new trade union committee and on  January  the election was held resulting in tile appointment of a new trade union committee.
.As regards the dismissal by the undertaking Calzados Gino Ltda. of Messrs. Jorge Venegas and Mauricio Rodrguez and two other workers for having refused to agree to reductions in their sales commissions, according to information from the labour inspectorates of Santiago and Santiago Oriente, no complaints or denunciations have been made by workers or trade union leaders of the above-mentioned undertaking regarding dismissals or the reduction in their wages.
.As regards the Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking, the Government states that on  November , the trade union leaders Messrs. Emetero Gonzlez Guzmn, Sixto Walter Manrquez Contreras and Jos Arturo Rivero Ortz appealed to the Labour Inspectorate regarding their dismissal by their employer. On  November  a labour inspector was sent to the undertaking and proceeded to impose an administrative fine for the infraction in question. The trade union leader Mr. Sixto Walter Manrquez Contreras was reinstated on  March ; he is now working normally in the undertaking and he was fully compensated for the period between tile date of his dismissal and his reinstatement. Mr. Emeterio Gonzlez Guzmn was reinstated and was paid compensation for the period during which lie was dismissed; he worked in the undertaking for one week after which he did not return. As regards Mr. Jos Arturo Rivera Ortiz, although the employer offered to reinstate him in his workplace, it is known that he is working in an interprovincial transport company, as a result of which it has not been possible to locate him regarding his reinstatement in the Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking.
.The Government also states that it has no information on the alleged dismissal of Efran Plaza, Pedro Gutirrez, Arsenio Angulo, Enrique Morgado and Jorge Pulgar, and that labour legislation currently in force allows workers to appeal to the courts when they feel that they are affected by a measure of this kind. The Government reiterates this last statement regarding the alleged dismissal of leaders of the Croupiers' Trade Union and the General Motors Trade Union.
.As regards the dismissal of five trade union leaders in the Celulosa Arauco y Constitucin undertaking, the Committee notes that two of the dismissed leaders reached a financial agreement with the undertaking whereby the latter would pay certain benefits and the leaders would withdraw their action for reinstatement lodged before the courts. As regards the other three trade union leaders dismissed by the above-mentioned undertaking, although the Committee notes that the dismissal was the result of their organisation of and participation in an illegal strike and that the persons concerned did not take their case to court, it regrets that the Government has not indicated the motives for which the above-mentioned strike was declared illegal and that for this reason the Committee is unable to reach conclusions based on a full knowledge of the events.
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of two trade union leaders and two workers of the Calzados Gino undertaking for having refused to sign a document in support of a reduction in sales commissions, the Committee notes that according to the Government no denunciations or complaints were made regarding dismissals or the reduction of remunerations in the above-mentioned undertaking.
.The Committee notes that the labour inspectorate applied an administrative fine for the dismissal of the three trade union leaders of the Envases Plsticos Campos undertaking, that two of the leaders were reinstated and that the third was offered reinstatement. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not provided information on the dismissal of  other workers in the said undertaking. Therefore,",-1,1983,Chile
267,"given the fact that the complainants allege that these workers were dismissed for having collaborated in setting up a trade union within the undertaking, the Committee notes in general that no person should be dismissed or be subject to other prejudicial measures regarding employment for carrying out legal trade union activities.
.The Committee observes finally that with regard to the other alleged dismissals, the Government has stated that it has no information and that legislation allows workers who feel that they have been affected by a measure of this kind to appeal to the courts. In these circumstances, and since the complainants have provided no concrete information on the acts which allegedly led to the dismissals in question and in as far as such alleged dismissals occurred in any case more than one year ago, the Committee believes that these allegations call for no further examination.Allegation concerning the disqualification of a trade union leader
.The complainants allege the disqualification of Mr. Victor Mendoza Vjar as leader of Workers' Union No.  of the National Coal Company Enacar de Lota, contained in a resolution from the administrative authority dated  June , which gave no explanation for the disqualification.
.The Government states that, by resolution No.  dated  June , the Labour Directorate disqualified Mr. Victor Mendoza Vjar from his post of director of Workers' Union No.  of the National Coal Company for failing to comply with the provisions of section , para. , of Legislative Decree No. , which establishes that a trade union director must ""have a length of service as a member of the trade union, as indicated in its statutes, and which may not be less than six months, except in cases where the trade union has existed for a shorter period of time"". In fact, it was established that Mr. Mendoza Vjar had joined the union on  December  and that the trade union election was held on  March . As a consequence, Victor Mendoza had been a member of the above-mentioned trade union for just over three and a half months when he was elected its director. The administrative resolution was the subject of an appeal in the courts and to date no decision has been given since the claimant has not furnished the documents to support his claim.
.The Committee observes that the disqualification of Mr. Mendoza Vjar as a trade union leader was made on  June  by resolution of the Labour Directorate pursuant to section , para. , of Legislative Decree No.  which establishes as a requisite that any trade union leader must have a length of service as a member of the trade union of not less than six months. In this respect, the Committee would like to point out that this requisite supposes an important restriction of the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom. Therefore, whilst it regrets the measure of disqualification as trade union leader applied to Mr. Mendoza Vjar on  June , the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to amending section , para. , of the legislative decree in order to guarantee fully the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.Allegation concerning the obstruction of a press conference
.The complainants allege that the judicial authorities erroneously dismissed an appeal which had been made against persons who prevented the leaders of four trade union organisations (Trade Union No.  of American Screw, S.A., Trade Union No.  of Laboratorio Chile, S.A., Trade Union No.  of Good Year, Planta Nylon, and the Industrial Assembly Inter-Undertaking Trade Union) from holding a press conference to provide information on the serious labour situation confronting workers and their trade union leaders.
.The Government states that the Ministry of the Interior has no information concerning alleged action to prevent the holding of a press conference.
.The Committee notes that the complainants have not indicated the date or place of the press conference to which they refer and that although they have pointed out that the judicial authorities rejected an appeal made against those persons who prevented the holding of the press conference, they have not enclosed a copy of the decision or given the grounds upon which the judicial decision was based. In these circumstances, and since the Government has stated that it has no information on the present allegation, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case requires no further examination.Allegation concerning the expulsion from the country of a trade union leader
.The complainants allege that the Government expelled Mr. Carlos Podlech, President of the Association of Farmers of Valdivia from the country, for statements which he had made concerning the serious situation confronting employers in this sector.
.The Government states that on  February  the measure against Mr. Carlos Podlech was lifted and he was permitted to return to the national territory.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not made observations on the alleged motives for the expulsion of Mr. Podlech from Chile (statements regarding the serious situation affecting employers in the agricultural sector). As a consequence, although it notes that on  February  the expulsion order against Mr. Podlech was revoked, the Committee notes that the expulsion from the country in which they live of trade union or employers' leaders for activities related to the exercise of their functions as such is not only contrary to human rights but is, furthermore, an interference in the activities of the organisation to which they belong.Allegation concerning the intimidation of a trade union leader
.The complainants allege that the Ministry of the interior lodged a complaint with the courts against Mr. Hernol Flores, President of the ANEF, for his having said that the Government knew who the assassins of Mr. Tucapel Jimnez, ex-President of the ANEF were. Following pressure and intimidation, Mr. Flores was obliged to withdraw his allegations and give explanations to the Government.
.The Government states that in October  the Court of Appeals of Santiago appointed one of its magistrates to prepare an indictment against Mr. Hernol Flores Opazo who, in a press conference given in the premises of the ANEF on  October had allegedly made offensive remarks against the Supreme Government, in violation of Act No. . After interviewing various persons present at the press conference and Mr. Flores himself, the magistrate concluded that there had been no violation of legislation in force. Mr. Flores, in any event was not deprived of his liberty and no measure of restriction is being applied against him.
.The Committee notes that the complainants have not indicated in what way pressures and intimidation were brought unless they mean the lodging of a complaint before the courts against the trade union leader Mr. Hernol Flores. The Committee also observes that the Government has indicated that an indictment was prepared against this trade union leader for having made remarks during a press conference which were offensive to the Supreme Government.
.In these circumstances, since no measure restricting the freedom of Mr. Flores was ordered and since the legal proceedings were concluded, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case requires no further examination.Allegations concerning the refusal of an undertaking to recognise two trade union leaders
.The complainants allege finally that the undertaking Good Year of Chile S.A.I.C. of Maip has paralysed collective bargaining by attempting to freeze wages between November  and November  and suppressing the indexing of wages and cash allowances. The arguments used by the undertaking are that two trade union representatives (Oscar Pino Morales and Pedro Bez Salinas) are ""undesirable and' highly argumentative persons"". Furthermore, according to the resolution of the Labour Inspectorate, these persons are not workers in the undertaking since they were dismissed in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No.  dated  July .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the period of application of the restrictions to collective bargaining as regards the indexing of wages, established by Act No. , should not exceed a reasonable time and should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.(b) The Committee considers that some of the undertakings in which strikes are prohibited do not seem to provide services that are essential in the strict sense of the term. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the need to limit the list of undertakings in which strikes are prohibited (cf. Diario Oficial (Official Gazette) of  August ) to those which provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).(c) The Committee considers that the prohibition for trade unions to receive financial aid from foreign natural or legal persons (Act No. ) may place an important limitation on the right of trade union organisations to affiliate",-1,1983,Chile
268,"to higher-level international organisations (federations and confederations), and to receive financial assistance from these organisations. The Committee asks the Government to take measures with a view to the amending of this provision.(d) The Committee points out in general that no person should be dismissed or subject to prejudicial measures regarding employment for carrying out legal trade union activities.(e) The Committee regrets the disqualification as a trade union leader of Mr. Mendoza Vjar on  June  in pursuance of section , para.  of Legislative Decree No. . The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to the amendment of this legal rule (which requires that a trade union leader must have a length of service as a member in the trade union of not less than six months), so as to guarantee fully the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.(f) The Committee notes that the measure of expulsion against the employers' leader Mr. Podlech was revoked on  February . The Committee stresses that the expulsion from the country in which they live of trade union or employers' leaders for activities related to the exercise of their functions as such is not only contrary to human rights but is, furthermore, an interference in the activities of the organisation to which they belong.(g) The Committee draws attention to the fact that the dismissal of a trade union leader or simply the fact that he leaves the work which he carried out in an undertaking should not affect his trade union status or functions. In this connection, the Committee regrets that in pursuance of section , para.  of Legislative Decree No.  (which requires that a trade union leader must have a length of service of not less than two years of continuous work in an undertaking) the dismissal of two trade union leaders on  July  should have led to their exclusion from negotiations on the draft collective agreement with the undertaking Good Year of Chile S.A.I.C. of Maip, presented on  September . The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to the amendment of section , para.  of Legislative Decree No.  in order to guarantee fully the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.(h) The Committee asks the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations of torture and physical ill-treatment of Mrs. Mara Darricarrere and Mr. Jos Ortiz Aravena.(i) As regards the remaining allegations, the Committee considers that these do not call for further examination.",-1,1983,Chile
269,".The present case concerns allegations of violation of freedom of association in Chile submitted by the following trade union organisations in various communications: the international Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  and  December ,  January and  March , the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) on  December ,  January and  March , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) on  January , the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), the Trade Unions International of workers in the metal Industry, the Confederation of Copper Workers on  December , and the National Trade Unions Confederation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials industries on  December .
.The Government supplied certain information in communications dated  February,  April and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.All the complainant organisations denounced the arrest and subsequent expulsion without justification on  December  of the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, President of the National Trade Union Co-coordinating Council (CNS), and Hector Cuevas, National President of the Confederation of Building workers, both of whom had launched a protest movement against the increase in the cost of living and unemployment.
.Specifically, the ICFTU in its initial communications described the calendar of events in the following manner: on  July , more than  trade union leaders headed by Manuel Bustos, President of the CNS, and Emilio Torres, President of the Confederation of Copper Workers, wrote to the President of the Republic requesting an audience to discuss the workers' problems and the application by employers of the new regulations concerning wages and job stability, which had been drawn up without the workers being consulted. Their letter called for a frank dialogue with the authorities and the suspension of Act No.  on collective bargaining. The letter was signed by the Confederation of Copper Workers, the Workers' United Front, the Confederation of Chilean Private Sector Employees and the CNS and contained  signatures of leaders of various confederations, federations, associations, national and local trade unions.
.According to the ICFTU, the President of the Republic replied that he did not grant audiences to communists. The trade union leaders Bustos and Torres and the president of the public sector workers, Hernol Flores, were then allegedly detained for some hours by the police authorities, interrogated and threatened by the Director-General of the intelligence service.
.A subsequent letter which was addressed to the Minister of Finance on  October described the economic situation of the workers and a set of urgent minimum measures which the Government was requested to introduce. The authorities once again refused to listen to the grievances of the legitimate representatives of the workers.
.On  October the Minister of the Interior refused to allow the Taxi Drivers Union, led by Juan Jara C, to meet to discuss the economic situation as it affected taxi drivers.
.On  November, by resolution No.  of the departmental labour inspector of Santiago South, Trade Union, No.  of the ""Sumac"" S.A cotton factory was prohibited from holding a union meeting of solidarity with the Polish trade unionist Lech Walesa to which the principal trade union leaders of Chile were to be invited.
.Or.  November, the CNS requested authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior to organise an artistic and cultural event which was designed to raise funds to help unemployed workers who had been dismissed and their families. The request stated that the event was to take place in the Plaza Artesanos on Thursday,  December, between  p.m. and . p.m. approximately and that it would include, it addition to performances by a number of entertainers, an address by a trade union leader on the subject of unemployment, price increases and the exceptional wage readjustment of  per cent. The request was signed by ten CNS leaders, including Manuel Bustos, but the authorities replied that, in order to be considered, it must be submitted by a trade union organisation with an accredited legal personality. Several duly accredited trade union organisations affiliated to the CNS therefore introduced the same request. This time, however, the authorities did not reply.
.On  November , uniformed members of the police burst into the headquarters of the National Trade Union of Industrial Assembly Workers (SINAII) in which the CNS offices are located and prevented the trade union leaders from entering the premises for several days.
.Finally, on  December , the planned trade union meeting took place in the Plaza Artesanos. However, it was repressed with extreme violence. The workers who had gathered peacefully were provoked and attacked by the uniformed police services and by groups of civilians armed with blurt and sharp instruments and who acted under the protection of the uniformed police. Several persons were wounded and arrested. Eight of these were in a serious condition, in particular Efrain Plaza, CNS President for the central zone, who had to undergo an emergency operation, as a result of the blows which he had received from the police. The lawyers who intervened in support of the wounded and detained, including Jaime Hales, Eduardo Loyola and Roberto Morales, were brutally beaten by the police. Five journalists from the newspapers ""El Mercurio"" and ""Las Ultimas Noticias"", the radio stations ""Portales"" and ""Cooperativas Vitalicias"" and the weekly publication ""Hoy"" were injured.
.The President of the CNS, Mr. Bustos, was also brutally beaten by the police and hospitalised in an emergency medical centre. He was later taken away from the CNS headquarters by police officers in civilian clothing.
.On  December, the Chilean Government admitted that Manuel Bustos was being held at police investigation premises but prohibited his family, friends and lawyers from contacting him.
.On  December the arbitrary expulsion from the country was ordered of Manuel Bustos and of Hector Cuevas, President of the Confederation of Building workers. They were landed at Rio de Janeiro, where Hector Cuevas had to be hospitalised for treatment of injuries inflicted upon him by the Chilean police.
.Furthermore, on  December the Government banished the following five trade unionists arrested on  December to the inhospitable northern region of the country: Elmiro Antonio Aravena Lastra was sent to Monte Patria, Juan de Dios Alvarez to Paiguana, Roberto Antonio Jimnez Villa Nueva to Inca de Oro, Sergio David Mancilla Marin to Taltal and Victor Enrique Caripillan Paine to Quillagua.
.In a letter dated  January, the WFTU confirms these facts and adds that the union leaders who were expelled from the country were taken to Pudahuel international airport without being able to collect their clothes or personal effects since their expulsion took place after their arrest. Manuel Bustos' passport was returned to him only in the aircraft prior to his arrival in Brazil.
.The WCL, in a letter dated  January , also denounces the arbitrary expulsion of the two trade unionists purely on trade union grounds.
.Furthermore, the National Trade Unions Confederation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials industries of , Chile, in its communication of  December , points out that Jose Figueroa, a union official in charge of the Confederation's international relations, was arrested and tortured for two days and brutally beaten on  December during the above-mentioned demonstration in the Plaza Artesanos and that Efrain Plaza Plaza, President of the Trade Union of Building workers, Technicians and Managerial Staff, was beaten by plain-clothed police officers, detained at Santiago central police station for five days and had to undergo surgery.
.Furthermore, in subsequent communications in March , the WFTU and the ICFTU denounces the arrest of the wife and three children of Hector Cuevas on  March , in front of the Presidential Palace of the Moneda in Santiago as they were carrying placards calling for his return to the country. The complainants state that they were released, but that Mrs. Cuevas has again been threatened with arrest and her children with expulsion from school.
.Finally, the ICFTU states that in January  the Appeals Court accepted a petition for amparo (habeas corpus) which had been lodged by Manuel Bustos and authorised him to return to the country. However, the military government introduced an appeal against this decision which prevented Manuel Bustos from exercising his right to live in his homeland. The ICFTU adds that the two expulsions are not exceptional and encloses a partial list of the names of  trade union leaders who ace currently living in exile.
.In an initial communication dated  February , the Government confirmed that Manuel Bustos had in fact been arrested and exiled by Decree No.  of  December  in application of article  (transitory) of the Constitution and that Supreme Decree No.  of  December  prohibited him from returning to the country.
.The Government explained that Manuel Bustos had submitted three petitions for habeas corpus (amparo) to the Appeals Court of Santiago. The first, dated  March, was rejected;",0,1982,Chile
270,"the second, dated  December, is currently being examined and a decision is pending; the third, dated  December, was accepted by the Appeals Court but, as the Government explains, the decision has been suspended pending consideration of a request for clarification lodged by the Ministry of the Interior. The Government adds that the Supreme Court accepted the Ministry of the Interior's request and that the provisions of Supreme Decree No.  are still in force. As of  February , the date on which the Government communicated its reply, the Court had not yet ruled on the matter.
.As regards Hector Cuevas, the Government confirms that he too was arrested and expelled under Decree Nos.  and  of  December  in application of the provisions of the Constitution and that he is also prohibited from returning to the country by Decree No. . Hector Cuevas introduced several habeas corpus petitions (amparo). The first petition, on  December , was rejected by the Appeals Court, but on  December he appealed against this decision and the case is still pending. The Government explains that a second petition submitted on  December and a third on  December  are also pending.
.The Government states generally that Manuel Bustos and other persons have been penalised on several occasions in the past for offences involving unlawful association, attempted subversion of law and order and disturbing the political peace. At the request of the Government, they were prosecuted for these offences in a court of first instance and were found guilty of the charges against them and duly sentenced. However, when the case passed to a higher court, the Government, in a gesture of good will, dropped the proceedings and allowed the persons concerned to be conditionally released.
.The Government explains that instead of understanding the situation, these persons resumed their illegal activities almost immediately even though they had been warned on many occasions to act within the limits of the law. Their activities resulted in their expulsion inasmuch as they constituted offences against the legal order in force, i.e. the holding of a public demonstration of a clearly political nature which had been prohibited by the competent authorities in pursuance of their legal powers.
.As regards Juan de Dios Alvarez, R.A. Jimnez, S. Mancilla, V. Caripillan and E. Aravena, the Government confirms that they have been banished to various parts of the country after being arrested by the police. Their banishment was in accordance with the law. Each of the persons concerned was able to lodge an appeal with the Appeals Court of Santiago but the appeals were all rejected. The banishment order was made in application of article  (transitory) of the Constitution, on the grounds of having caused disturbances during an unauthorised public demonstration. The action taken by the Government against Manuel Bustos, Hector Cuevas and the other persons mentioned above was thus based on the legal provisions currently in force.
.The appeals lodged by Manuel Bustos and Hector Cuevas are still pending before the courts and the Government is awaiting a final ruling before transmitting a full reply to the ILO.
.In a more recent communication dated  April , the Government explains that Mrs. Cuevas and her children were in fact arrested when they were attempting, without authorisation, to enter the Moneda Palace carrying placards. They were taken to the police station and released after verification of their domicile. Mrs. Cuevas was ordered to appear before the local police magistrate who ordered her to pay a small fire for causing a disturbance in public, which under municipal law constitutes a misdemeanour rather than an offence.
.The Government categorically rejects the allegation whereby the children of the trade union leader had been subjected to threats.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government states that Jose Figueroa was arrested on  December  and was released after a hearing on the following day and that Efrain Plaza Plaza was not arrested. It further states that the de facto headquarters of the organisation known as the National Trade Union Co-ordination Council (CNS) was not closed and that there is no prohibition against entering the premises. As regards the petitions for amparo (habeus corpus) against the exile of Messrs. Bustos and Cruzman, the Government states that their defence lawyers presented four appeals of which three have been dealt with. In the fourth case a request has been made that the other three cases be dealt with jointly. The Government also states that both the Appeals Court and the Supreme Court considered that the measures taken were legal.
.The case before the Committee concerns the arrest and subsequent expulsion of two trade unionists, namely the President of the National Trade Union Co-ordination Council (CNS), Manuel Eustos, and Mr. Hector Cuevas, for having organised trade union demonstrations as part of a protest movement by the workers against the increase in the cost of living and unemployment, as well as injuries inflicted on trade unionists during a demonstration and the banishment of five trade union leaders by administrative decision to the north of the country.
.The Committee notes that Manuel Bustos lodged an appeal against the expulsion order and that the petition was accepted by the Appeals Court, but that the Ministry of the Interior submitted a request for clarification with the Supreme Court on which no final ruling has yet been made.
.The Committee notes that, according to the information of the complainants, the trade union leaders concerned made several requests to meet the authorities to discuss grievances regarding the occupational interests of their members, that they requested advance authorisation to hold a meeting on  December  and gave details of the themes the artistic, cultural and trade union event being organised and the time at which it would take place, and that they went ahead with the event without having received a reply to the authorisation requested. The Government has not replied to the allegation concerning the violent repression of the event.
.The Committee observes that the Government refers to the past record of the trade union leader Manuel Bustos, who had previously been 'sentenced by a court of the first instance for unlawful association and had subsequently benefited from the clemency of the authorities on the condition that he acted within the limits of the law.
.The Committee recalls that it examined the matter of Manuel Bustos' imprisonment in a previous case concerning Chile' and that it had stressed at the time that the adoption of measures of detention and sentencing against workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, the Committee has emphasised many times the importance which it attaches to the right to hold trade union meetings as one of the basic aspects of trade union rights.
.In the present case, the Committee deplores that the two trade union leaders concerned were expelled from Chile and forbidden to return to the country for having organised a trade union demonstration, which was not authorised by the authorities. As regards the demonstration in question the Committee deplores the violence used by the forces of order against the demonstrators and recalls that the right to demonstrate is essential for the exercise of trade union rights. As regards the measures of exile the Committee stresses, as it has done on many occasions before, that the forced exile of trade unionists is a serious infringement of human rights and also of freedom of association since it weakens the trade union movement as a whole.
.The Committee considers that it should have at its disposal the text of the judgements delivered following the appeals that have been lodged. It, accordingly, requests the Government to transmit copies of these judgements.
.As regards the banishment of the five trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, the Committee recalls that the restriction of a person's movement to a limited area, accompanied by a prohibition of entering into the area in which his trade union operates and in which he normally carries out his trade union functions, is inconsistent with the normal enjoyment of the right of association and should therefore be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and, especially, by observance of the right of those concerned to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with deep concern that the trade union leaders Manuel Bustos and Hector Cuevas have been expelled from the country and that they are prohibited from returning to Chile.(b) As regards the demonstration which gave rise to the measures of exile being taken, the Committee deplores the violence used by the forces of order against the demonstrators; it recalls that the right to demonstrate is essential for the exercise of trade union rights.(c) The Committee requests the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements delivered in the appeals lodged concerning the forced exile o",-1,1982,Chile

Bustos and Cuevas.(d) As regards the trade union leaders who have been exiled from Chile for having organised a trade union demonstration, the Committee would stress that forced exile constitutes a serious violation of human rights and of trade union rights since it weakens the trade union movement as a whole.(e) As regards the banishment of the five trade unionists cited by the complainants, the Committee recalls that no measure restricting a person's movement to a limited area or placing him under house arrest should be taken unless it is accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards.",1,1982,Chile
272,".In a communication, dated  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Chile. The Government supplied its observations in a letter dated  November .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the ICFTU alleges that Mr. Hernn Mery Toro, a leader of the Coordinadora Nacional Sindical (CNS) was subjected to harassment by the Chilean security services. It explains that, on  September , Hernn Mery left his home at  a.m. to go to the headquarters of the CNS in order to attend a meeting of the National Executive of the organisation and to give a press conference on the economic and social situation of Chilean workers.
.On entering his car, continues the ICFTU, he realised that he was being watched by individuals in plain clothes who, on seeing him drive off, followed closely behind in another can In the middle of the journey, the pursuing car shot forward and bumped violently into that of Hernn Mery. The occupants of the car identified themselves as members of the National Central Information Organisation, and abused and threatened Hernn Mery for his activities.
.The ICFTU observes that this attack presents the same characteristics as the acts of intimidation perpetrated against Tucapel Jimnez, chairman of the National Grouping of Public Employees, before he was murdered. The ICFTU declares in conclusion that it fears for the life of Hernn Mery.
.The Government indicates, in reply to the complaint, that the authorities responsible for protecting public order and safety have no information about the facts recounted in the ICFTU's communications. It adds that the police and security organs have not received any complaint from the person concerned on this subject. Likewise, Mr. Hernn Mery has not filed any accusation with the courts. The Government considers therefore that the ICFTU's complaint should be rejected as unfounded.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case concern the harassment by the security services of the leader of a national trade union Organisation. The Government, for its part, declares that it has no knowledge of the facts mentioned in the complaint.
.The Committee must express its concern over the fact that the authorities do not seem to have carried out an inquiry to determine the responsibility in this case. It must recall that it has already had to deal with allegations of this type in ether oases relating to Chile. It considers it useful to draw the Government's attention to the fact that a climate of insecurity and fear characterised by acts of intimidation against trade union leaders constitutes a serious threat to the exercise of trade union rights and that such acts should call for severe measures on the part of the authorities.",0,1982,Chile
273,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  September , The Government replied in a communication dated  October .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the WFTU alleges that Mr. Silvio Victoriano Espinoza, leader of the Federation of Glass Workers, disappeared in the last week of August. Two weeks later he was expelled from the country, and is now in Sao Paulo without papers.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that not only is Mr. Silvio Victoriano Espinoza not a trade union leader of the National Federation of Trade Unions of Workers in the Glass and Related Industries, the only federation of the glass branch of industry, but neither is he listed as a trade union leader in the official national registers. The Government has sent a statement from the Labour Inspectorate corroborating its assertions.
.The Committee observes that the complainant has alleged that Silvio Victoriano Espinoza, trade union leader of the Federation of Glass Workers, disappeared and was subsequently expelled from Chile. The Committee also notes that the Government has denied that Mr. Espinoza is a trade union leader and has sent a statement from the Labour Inspectorate corroborating this assertion. Therefore, taking account of the information supplied by the Government and in the absence of more precise information from the complainant, the Committee considers that it is not in a position to draw conclusions on the allegations presented.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1982,Chile
274,".In a communication of  August , the Trade Unions International of Workers in Commerce (TUIWC) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Chile. The Government forwarded its observations in a letter dated  September .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Fight to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint refers to the dismissal by the footwear undertaking of Gino d'Arturo Farias, President of the National Federation of Workers in Commerce and Co-operatives of Chile.
.The complainant organisation explains that Mr. Arturo Farias was entitled to special protection under the law by virtue of the fact that he was a trade union leader. Furthermore, he had additional rights as he has  years seniority in the undertaking.
.In the view of the TUIWC, the dismissal of Mr. Arturo Farias is a measure of reprisal against the trade union organisation of which he was the leader, aimed at hindering and preventing its activities.
.In its communication, the Government confirms that Mr. Arturo Farias was dismissed by his undertaking on  June . On  June  an inspector of the Ministry of Labour went to the company's head office to verify whether, in this instance, the legislation in force had been respected.
.According to section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , the Government continues, in the case of workers subject to trade union protection, the employer shall not terminate any contract of employment without prior permission from a court, which can only be granted in cases expressly provided for in the Legislative Decree, that is: expiry of a contract of specified duration; completion of the work for which the contract was concluded; dishonesty, acts of violence, insults or highly immoral conduct; business carried on by the worker within the undertaking's range of activities, if it has been prohibited by the employer in writing in the worker's contract; the worker's failure to report for work; the worker's desertion of his job without a valid reason; any serious failure to discharge the obligations implicit in the contract; the operating requirements of the undertaking, establishment or service.
.According to the Government, in this case the dismissal was issued without prior judicial permission having been requested. The undertaking cited reasons of staff reduction and carried out the dismissal under section (f) of Legislative Decree No.  of . As the undertaking had infringed the law by failing to seek judicial permission, the labour inspector imposed the maximum fine provided for by the legislation, namely the equivalent of US$ .
.The trade union leader concerned brought an appeal to the courts against his employer. The proceedings are under way and the Government will send the judgement when it is given.
.In conclusion, the Government considers that there has not been an infringement of freedom of association since, four days after the dismissal, a labour inspector went to the spot and penalised the undertaking after finding that the law had been broken.
.The present case concerns the dismissal of a trade union leader in the footwear sector. The Committee notes that the undertaking which effected the dismissal failed to respect the provision of Chilean legislation which requires prior permission from a court before any trade union leader is dismissed. Having noted this infringement, the labour inspector reported the undertaking.
.While noting that the employer has thus been penalised, the Committee must emphasise that in its view the imposition of relatively modest fines on undertakings which have infringed provisions protecting trade union leaders is not always a strong enough deterrent to prevent acts of anti-union discrimination. One way of affording effective protection might be to consider the dismissal of a trade union leader null and void as long as prior permission has not been granted.
.In this respect, the Committee believes it should draw the Government's attention to the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), Paragraph  of which lists a number of measures which might be adopted to ensure effective protection of workers' representatives. These measures include, in particular, the reinstatement of workers' representatives in their jobs in the event of unjustified dismissal with payment of unpaid wages and with maintenance of their acquired rights; provision for laying on the employer the burden of proving that the dismissal was justified; recognition of a priority to be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce.
.In this case, the Committee notes that the person concerned has brought an appeal before the courts. It considers that it would be useful for it to have the judgement to be handed down so that it may determine the circumstances or reasons for the dismissal of Mr. Arturo Farias in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee draws to the Government's attention the measures recommended by the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ) to afford effective protection to such representatives.(b) The Committee requests the Government to provide i with a copy of the judgement to be handed down following the appeal brought before the courts by the person concerned.",-1,1982,Chile
275,".In a communication dated  July , the National Confederation of Trade Unions of Workers in the Building, Wood, Construction and Allied industries presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Chile, which was also signed by the Chairman of Workers' Union No.  of the international Construction Co. Ltd. Chile and Workers' Union No.  of the Gordo Atkinson and Co. enterprise. The Government supplied its observations in a letter dated  September ,
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that the transnational enterprise International Construction Co. Ltd. Chile, in collusion with the directorate of the Ministry of Labour, deprived the , workers of the Colbn Machicura hydro-electric complex of the right to collective bargaining. The complainant furnishes two enclosures with its communication: resolution No. , adopted by the labour directorate in the dispute between the workers and the enterprise, and the text of the appeal which they submitted to the Santiago Court of Appeal.
.According to these documents, on  May  the bargaining Committee appointed by the workers of the enterprise submitted a draft collective labour agreement to the employer with a view to initiating a collective bargaining procedure.
.On  June , the enterprise gave its reply on the draft agreement, formulating several objections and observations, particularly with regard to the fact that the draft text claimed to include workers who were not legally entitled to be covered by a collective agreement, as Legislative Decree No.  on collective bargaining does not apply to workers hired for temporary work. The reason for this objection was that the workers in question had been hired to perform temporary work, as the maximum duration of the project was until  August . The employer also stated that the work was divided into various tasks which were performed simultaneously or successively within a fixed period and in different places, so that the workers were actually employed for three or six months or more, but always within the maximum period ending on  August .
.On  June , the five members of the bargaining Committee submitted an appeal to the labour directorate concerning the reply of the enterprise. They explained in their complaint that the employer had referred to only some of the workers covered by negotiations without specifying who, in its opinion, would be affected by the ban on bargaining. The members of the bargaining Committee considered that this omission constituted sufficient grounds to reject the observation made by the enterprise. They also pointed out that while the majority of the workers covered by the collective bargaining had -day contracts, it was none the less true that they continued to provide their services for an unlimited period once the term had expired. The members of the bargaining Committee stated further that their work consisted of civil engineering tasks, not building work, as the employer maintained. The members of the bargaining Committee concluded in their appeal that the aim of the enterprise was to avoid bargaining, and thus to evade the provisions of Legislative Decree No. .
.On  June  the labour directorate, in a resolution No. , while accepting some of the claims submitted by the bargaining Committee concerning the capacity of its members to represent the workers and the validity of the signatures to the draft collective agreement, rejected the appeal concerning the non-entitlement of the workers involved to take part in collective bargaining. The labour directorate considered that these workers had indeed been taken on exclusively for a specific temporary job.
.The members of the bargaining Committee considered that this decision of the labour directorate was based on two false assumptions, namely that all construction work is of temporary duration and that all persons engaged in such work are building workers.
.After recalling the events referred to in the complaint, the Government upholds the labour directorate's view that the work performed in building the Colbn Machicura hydro-electric station is of temporary duration. It points out in this respect that in trade union legislation (Legislative Decree No. , section ), building work is described as temporary work. In describing building work as temporary, continues the Government, the law does not, however, deny the right of collective bargaining to all building workers. The Government specifies further that if workers have not been engaged exclusively for a specified project or job, or if these projects and jobs are not temporary, then the workers are entitled to bargain collectively.
.The Government points out that, in the present case, the workers were taken on to provide their services on a particular site, the Colbn hydro-electric project in Linares Province. The contracts do not become permanent since the work is by its very nature temporary. Therefore, under the terms of section  of Legislative Decree No. , these workers may not bargain collectively.
.The Government points out that the members of the bargaining Committee, following the unfavourable decision of the labour directorate, had brought an appeal for protection before the Santiago Court of Appeal against the labour directorate for the illegality of resolution No.  and for its improper and arbitrary decision. On  July  the Court of Appeal declared the appeal irreceivable after hearing the lawyers of both parties, as the Constitution does not provide for appeals of protection in matters related to collective bargaining.
.The members of the bargaining Committee then submitted a second appeal on  July  to the Supreme Court, which upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on  August .
.The Government concludes that it is clear from the elements of the case that there has been no infringement of freedom of association, the workers having had access to defence and to the highest court of justice in the country.
.The allegations presented in the present case concern denial of the right of collective bargaining to workers engaged for construction work on a hydro-electric complex. In accordance with Legislative Decree No.  on collective bargaining, the workers had elected a bargaining Committee, which had submitted a draft collective agreement to the employer. The latter, as entitled by law, made objections, primarily on the grounds that the draft text included in its scope workers who, under the terms of Legislative Decree No. , could not be covered by collective agreements, as they were employed on a temporary basis. The bargaining Committee, considering that these objections by the enterprise would result in , workers being deprived of the right of collective bargaining, had then submitted an appeal to the labour directorate, stating in particular that the workers in question had in fact been engaged on the construction site for an unspecified period. The labour directorate rejected the argument, noting that in this case the work was by its very nature temporary. Subsequent appeals brought by the members of the bargaining Committee before the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court failed to obtain recognition of the right of collective bargaining for the workers in involved.
.The question at issue in the present case is thus whether workers engaged on the construction site of a hydro-electric complex should enjoy the right to collective bargaining. In this respect, the Committee on Freedom of Association has always considered that the right of free collective bargaining is a fundamental trade union right for all employees not covered by the safeguards provided by civil service regulations. The International Labour Conference itself decided that the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), should be applied in all branches of economic activity, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and police. In the Committee's opinion, there should therefore be no obstacles to collective bargaining in the building sector.
.As regards the argument put forward by the Government that the workers concerned were engaged for a limited period, the Committee points out that in fact the planned duration of the project was to be until  August . The remaining period (over three years until completion of the hydro-electric complex) was thus amply sufficient for a collective agreement to regulate the working conditions of employees on this construction site. In addition, the Committee considers that, in view of the nature of the building sector, where a large number of workers are engaged for the duration of a single project, to deny the right of collective bargaining to temporary workers amounts to depriving virtually a whole sector of this right, which is contrary to the principle of freedom of association. The Committee therefore expresses the hope that the Government will take the necessary measures to amend the legislation with a view to granting the right of collective bargaining to these workers.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) the Committee recalls that the right to free collective bargaining should apply to all branches of economic activity, with the sole possible exception of the armed forces and",0,1982,Chile
276,police;(b) the Committee therefore expresses the hope that the Government will take the necessary measures to amend the legislation with a view to granting the right of collective bargaining to workers on fixed-term contracts in the building sector.,2,1982,Chile
277,".In communications dated  April,  May and  May , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented complaints of violation of trade union rights in Chile. The Government supplied its observations in letters dated  and  September .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Since all the complaints presented by the ICFTU relate to alleged violations of the right of assembly, the Committee has decided to examine the three cases jointly.
.In a telegram dated  April  (Case No. ), the ICFTU states that a national consultative meeting which the National Trade Union Coordinating Committee had planned to hold on ,  and  April  at Punta de Tralca for the purpose of discussing trade union and social matters was prohibited by the Chilean authorities.
.Another telegram from the ICFTU of  May  (Case No. ) states that the authorities forcibly prevented the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee from holding a trade union meeting on  May .
.Lastly, in a letter of  May  (Case No. ), the ICFTU refers to a meeting of Chilean trade union leaders organised by the National Association of Public Service Employees (ANEF) on  May  at the Association's headquarters. According to the ICFTU, all of the country's political circles were aware of this meeting, and the leaders of legally constituted occupational organisations and trade unions intended to be present. The purpose of the meeting, the ICFTU states, was to attempt to unify Chilean social forces in seeking solutions to the serious social and economic problems affecting most of the country's population.
.On  May , the Ministry of Justice, exercising the powers conferred on it by legislative Decrees Nos.  of ,  of  and  of  and section  of Presidential Decree No.  of , notified the ANEF leaders that it was not possible to hold the meeting scheduled. On the same day, officials of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Labour, accompanied by members of the police force, went to the ANEF headquarters to announce that the meeting was prohibited.
.The ICFTU considers that these prohibitions constitute interference in the activities of trade union organisations and a violation of Convention No.  and of the rights of assembly and expression.
.Regarding the consultative meeting which the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee wished to organise on ,  and  April  at Punta de Tralca, the Government states, in its communication of  September , that the authorities did not prohibit or prevent that meeting. It was the organisers themselves who decided to call it off.
.Regarding the meeting of the National Trade Union Coordinating Committee scheduled for  May , the Government states that the authorities responsible for ensuring law and order were not aware that that meeting had been prohibited. It is not true that a meeting of that body was prevented by force. The National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee held a meeting on  July , which was reported by several broadcasting stations. The Government states that the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee is a de facto body and as such is not entitled to represent workers.
.Concerning the prohibition of the ANEF meeting, the Government explains, first of all, that this organisation obtained legal personality under Presidential Decree No.  of the Ministry of Justice dated  July , pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code (Title XXXIII of Book I). Its activities are governed by Supreme Decree No.  of  concerning private law associations and foundations.
.The Government goes on to say that the ANEF therefore is a non-profit-making association governed by private law whose sole purpose, according to article  of its by-laws, is ""the administrative, technical and cultural guidance and advancement of its members and the promotion of their social welfare"". According to article  of the by-laws, ""the ANEF's action shall be carried out in the social and cultural field and may not interfere directly or indirectly in political, religious or trade union activities"". This prohibition, moreover, is provided for in section  of Decree No.  which provides that such associations may not pursue trade union or profit-making aims.
.The Government therefore regards the ANEF as a private law, mutualist association intended for improving the cultural level of its members, different from any other type of organisation governed by a legal status of its own, as is the case of trade union organisations.
.The Ministry of justice is responsible for supervising private law associations and foundations. In accordance with section  of Decree No. , such organisations must not be contrary to law, public order or morality and must pursue the aims for which they were established without infringing their by-laws. If such an organisation changes its statutory purposes or carries on activities contrary to law, public order or morality; the President of the Republic may withdraw its legal personality under section  of Decree No.  and section  of the civil Code.
.In the present case, the association in question seriously infringed its by-laws, the Civil Code and Decree No.  by calling a trade union meeting. In these circumstances, the Ministry of Justice would normally have had to enforce the law and proceed to annulling the ANEF's legal personality. However, it chose instead to notify it that the meeting scheduled could not be held and thus to prevent a wholly irregular situation contrary to the purposes and aims of the association and in violation of existing legislation and regulations.
.As for the complainant's allegation that Convention No.  has been violated, the Government recalls that it has not ratified that instrument and consequently cannot infringe a Convention which is not binding upon it. Paragraph  of Article  of the Convention provides that the Convention is binding only upon Members whose ratifications have been registered, and paragraph  of the same Article provides that it will come into force  months after the date on which its ratification has been registered.
.Before dealing with the substance of the case, the Committee considers it worth while to answer the objections raised by the Government on the ground that it has not ratified Convention No. . While fully aware that the Convention, consequently, is not binding on Chile, the Committee must recall that this country, on becoming a member of the ILO, undertook to respect certain principles, including the principle of freedom of association. As stated by the Committee, ""the function of the International labour Organisation in regard to trade union rights is to contribute to the effectiveness of the general principle of freedom of association as one of the primary safeguards of peace and social justice"". In fulfilling its responsibilities in the matter, the Committee also stated the Organisation must not hesitate to discuss in an international forum cases which are of such a character as to affect substantially the attainment of the ILO's aims and purposes as set forth in the Constitution of the Organisation, the Declaration of Philadelphia and the various Conventions concerning freedom of association. However, the Committee notes that the Government has largely co-operated by responding to the Organisation's requests for information.
.In the case in question, the allegations relate to infringements on three occasions of the right of assembly on the part of trade union organisations. Concerning two of the meetings, which had been called by the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee, the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply are completely contradictory since the Government denies that the meetings were prohibited. In these circumstances, the Committee can only recall generally that the right of assembly on the part of workers' organisations constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights.
.Concerning the meeting organised by the ANEF, an organisation grouping workers of the public sector, the Government explains its prohibition on the ground that this organisation, legally constituted as a private law association, is not entitled under the Civil Code to carry on trade union activities. The Committee would point out in this connection that the workers in the public sector have had to form this type of organisation precisely because section  of the public service regulations prohibits employees and workers in the government service to form trade unions. For years, however, the organisations set up by workers in the public sector, such as the ANEF, have been carrying on trade union activities. Moreover, this fact has been recognised by the Government itself since on several occasions ANEF leaders have formed part of the workers' delegation to the international labour Conference
.The Committee must note with concern, therefore, that not only has the Government failed to grant trade union rights to public employees as the Committee has repeatedly requested it to do but in addition it has, by prohibiting meetings organised by the ANEF, impaired the free exercise of the activities of this organisation, which up to now was able to",0,1982,Chile
278,"carry on trade union activities. Consequently, the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that public employees should, like workers in the private sector, be able to establish organisations of their own choosing to promote and defend the interests of their members and that these organisations should be entitled to organise their activities and, in particular, to hold meetings without interference from the public authorities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) The Committee recalls generally that the right of assembly on the part of workers' organisations constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights.(b) Specifically concerning the prohibition of an ANEF meeting, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that public employees should be able to establish organisations of their own choosing and that these organisations should be entitled to organise their activities and, in particular, to hold meetings without interference from the public authorities.",-1,1982,Chile

.Concerning the meeting organised by the ANEF, an organisation grouping workers of the public sector, the Government explains its prohibition on the ground that this organisation, legally constituted as a private law association, is not entitled under the Civil Code to carry on trade union activities. The Committee would point out in this connection that the workers in the public sector have had to form this type of organisation precisely because section  of the public service regulations prohibits employees and workers in the government service to form trade unions. For years, however, the organisations set up by workers in the public sector, such as the ANEF, have been carrying on trade union activities. Moreover, this fact has been recognised by the Government itself since on several occasions ANEF leaders have formed part of the workers' delegation to the international labour Conference
.The Committee must note with concern, therefore, that not only has the Government failed to grant trade union rights to public employees as the Committee has repeatedly requested it to do but in addition it has, by prohibiting meetings organised by the ANEF, impaired the free exercise of the activities of this organisation, which up to now was able to",0,1982,Chile
280,"carry on trade union activities. Consequently, the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that public employees should, like workers in the private sector, be able to establish organisations of their own choosing to promote and defend the interests of their members and that these organisations should be entitled to organise their activities and, in particular, to hold meetings without interference from the public authorities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) The Committee recalls generally that the right of assembly on the part of workers' organisations constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights.(b) Specifically concerning the prohibition of an ANEF meeting, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that public employees should be able to establish organisations of their own choosing and that these organisations should be entitled to organise their activities and, in particular, to hold meetings without interference from the public authorities.",-1,1982,Chile
281,".In communications dated  April,  May and  May , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented complaints of violation of trade union rights in Chile. The Government supplied its observations in letters dated  and  September .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Since all the complaints presented by the ICFTU relate to alleged violations of the right of assembly, the Committee has decided to examine the three cases jointly.
.In a telegram dated  April  (Case No. ), the ICFTU states that a national consultative meeting which the National Trade Union Coordinating Committee had planned to hold on ,  and  April  at Punta de Tralca for the purpose of discussing trade union and social matters was prohibited by the Chilean authorities.
.Another telegram from the ICFTU of  May  (Case No. ) states that the authorities forcibly prevented the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee from holding a trade union meeting on  May .
.Lastly, in a letter of  May  (Case No. ), the ICFTU refers to a meeting of Chilean trade union leaders organised by the National Association of Public Service Employees (ANEF) on  May  at the Association's headquarters. According to the ICFTU, all of the country's political circles were aware of this meeting, and the leaders of legally constituted occupational organisations and trade unions intended to be present. The purpose of the meeting, the ICFTU states, was to attempt to unify Chilean social forces in seeking solutions to the serious social and economic problems affecting most of the country's population.
.On  May , the Ministry of Justice, exercising the powers conferred on it by legislative Decrees Nos.  of ,  of  and  of  and section  of Presidential Decree No.  of , notified the ANEF leaders that it was not possible to hold the meeting scheduled. On the same day, officials of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Labour, accompanied by members of the police force, went to the ANEF headquarters to announce that the meeting was prohibited.
.The ICFTU considers that these prohibitions constitute interference in the activities of trade union organisations and a violation of Convention No.  and of the rights of assembly and expression.
.Regarding the consultative meeting which the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee wished to organise on ,  and  April  at Punta de Tralca, the Government states, in its communication of  September , that the authorities did not prohibit or prevent that meeting. It was the organisers themselves who decided to call it off.
.Regarding the meeting of the National Trade Union Coordinating Committee scheduled for  May , the Government states that the authorities responsible for ensuring law and order were not aware that that meeting had been prohibited. It is not true that a meeting of that body was prevented by force. The National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee held a meeting on  July , which was reported by several broadcasting stations. The Government states that the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee is a de facto body and as such is not entitled to represent workers.
.Concerning the prohibition of the ANEF meeting, the Government explains, first of all, that this organisation obtained legal personality under Presidential Decree No.  of the Ministry of Justice dated  July , pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code (Title XXXIII of Book I). Its activities are governed by Supreme Decree No.  of  concerning private law associations and foundations.
.The Government goes on to say that the ANEF therefore is a non-profit-making association governed by private law whose sole purpose, according to article  of its by-laws, is ""the administrative, technical and cultural guidance and advancement of its members and the promotion of their social welfare"". According to article  of the by-laws, ""the ANEF's action shall be carried out in the social and cultural field and may not interfere directly or indirectly in political, religious or trade union activities"". This prohibition, moreover, is provided for in section  of Decree No.  which provides that such associations may not pursue trade union or profit-making aims.
.The Government therefore regards the ANEF as a private law, mutualist association intended for improving the cultural level of its members, different from any other type of organisation governed by a legal status of its own, as is the case of trade union organisations.
.The Ministry of justice is responsible for supervising private law associations and foundations. In accordance with section  of Decree No. , such organisations must not be contrary to law, public order or morality and must pursue the aims for which they were established without infringing their by-laws. If such an organisation changes its statutory purposes or carries on activities contrary to law, public order or morality; the President of the Republic may withdraw its legal personality under section  of Decree No.  and section  of the civil Code.
.In the present case, the association in question seriously infringed its by-laws, the Civil Code and Decree No.  by calling a trade union meeting. In these circumstances, the Ministry of Justice would normally have had to enforce the law and proceed to annulling the ANEF's legal personality. However, it chose instead to notify it that the meeting scheduled could not be held and thus to prevent a wholly irregular situation contrary to the purposes and aims of the association and in violation of existing legislation and regulations.
.As for the complainant's allegation that Convention No.  has been violated, the Government recalls that it has not ratified that instrument and consequently cannot infringe a Convention which is not binding upon it. Paragraph  of Article  of the Convention provides that the Convention is binding only upon Members whose ratifications have been registered, and paragraph  of the same Article provides that it will come into force  months after the date on which its ratification has been registered.
.Before dealing with the substance of the case, the Committee considers it worth while to answer the objections raised by the Government on the ground that it has not ratified Convention No. . While fully aware that the Convention, consequently, is not binding on Chile, the Committee must recall that this country, on becoming a member of the ILO, undertook to respect certain principles, including the principle of freedom of association. As stated by the Committee, ""the function of the International labour Organisation in regard to trade union rights is to contribute to the effectiveness of the general principle of freedom of association as one of the primary safeguards of peace and social justice"". In fulfilling its responsibilities in the matter, the Committee also stated the Organisation must not hesitate to discuss in an international forum cases which are of such a character as to affect substantially the attainment of the ILO's aims and purposes as set forth in the Constitution of the Organisation, the Declaration of Philadelphia and the various Conventions concerning freedom of association. However, the Committee notes that the Government has largely co-operated by responding to the Organisation's requests for information.
.In the case in question, the allegations relate to infringements on three occasions of the right of assembly on the part of trade union organisations. Concerning two of the meetings, which had been called by the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee, the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply are completely contradictory since the Government denies that the meetings were prohibited. In these circumstances, the Committee can only recall generally that the right of assembly on the part of workers' organisations constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights.
.Concerning the meeting organised by the ANEF, an organisation grouping workers of the public sector, the Government explains its prohibition on the ground that this organisation, legally constituted as a private law association, is not entitled under the Civil Code to carry on trade union activities. The Committee would point out in this connection that the workers in the public sector have had to form this type of organisation precisely because section  of the public service regulations prohibits employees and workers in the government service to form trade unions. For years, however, the organisations set up by workers in the public sector, such as the ANEF, have been carrying on trade union activities. Moreover, this fact has been recognised by the Government itself since on several occasions ANEF leaders have formed part of the workers' delegation to the international labour Conference
.The Committee must note with concern, therefore, that not only has the Government failed to grant trade union rights to public employees as the Committee has repeatedly requested it to do but in addition it has, by prohibiting meetings organised by the ANEF, impaired the free exercise of the activities of this organisation, which up to now was able to",0,1982,Chile

283,".By communications of  and  March  the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented complaints of violation of trade union rights in Chile. The Government supplied its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints refer to the murder, on  February , in the suburbs of Santiago of the trade union leader, Tucapel Jimenez, Chairman of the National Grouping of Public Employees (ANEF). A week before his death Tucapel Jimenez had made statements in favour of workers' unity.
.The ICFTU attaches to its communication a copy of an ""appeal for preventive protection"" which was allegedly lodged with the Supreme Court by several trade union leaders including Tucapel Jimenez. The signatories to this undated appeal state that they were prevented by the police from entering the premises of the Valparaiso Dockers' Federation and that the form of police intervention gave them cause to fear for their lives, their physical well-being and their freedom. They explain that their intention was to express their solidarity with the port workers and that they acted peacefully. Despite that, policemen armed with machine guns surrounded the area and armoured cars and police wagons were placed in front of the entrance to the Federation. In addition, security agents took individual photographs of the trade union leaders so as to make them feel that pressure and threats were being used against them. A high police official prevented the trade union leaders from entering the building without giving reasons or producing a warrant. The signatories add that they are aware that they are being followed and that no place is safe for them. They request the restoration of law and the guarantee of effective protection.
.In its reply the Government explains that Tucapel Jimenez's death occurred when the President of the Republic was in the southern region of the country with a government group. When informed of the incidents, the President energetically condemned the crime and ordered that an inquiry be opened immediately. The Minister of the Interior returned to Santiago to cc-ordinate the task of the investigation services.
.In view of the seriousness of the facts and so as to show the Government's interest in a speedy solution to the affair, the following day the Minister of the Interior requested the Santiago Court of Appeal to name a special examining magistrate. The police services gave their full co-operation to the magistrate who ordered various inquiries. Over  policemen took part in the search for the murderer or murderers. The searches are still continuing.
.The Government states that the President of the Republic has devoted special attention to the progress of the inquiry and is kept permanently informed by the Ministry of the Interior and by the bodies attached to the President's Office. It adds that both the Government and the nation have been unanimous in condemning this cowardly murder. The Government states that one idea that was advanced in this case was that Tucapel Jimenez was ""killed"" as part of an international conspiracy aimed at creating problems for the Government. Both the family lawyers and those of the trade union organisation to which he belonged are taking an active part in the evolution of the procedure.
.As for the ICFTU's allegations concerning the appeal for protection allegedly lodged by Tucapel Jimenez with the Supreme Court, the Government points out that the court competent to hear such appeals is not the Supreme Court but the Appeal Court. The Government attaches a copy of a certified statement of the Appeal Court according to which no appeal for protection was presented by Tucapel Jimenez in ,  or .
.In the first place, the Committee deeply deplores the murder of the trade union leader, Tucapel Jimenez, who had played a primary role in the history of the trade union movement in his country.
.The Committee notes that a judicial inquiry has been opened. The Committee hopes that this inquiry will allow for the rapid collection of the facts and determination of responsibility in this matter. It must point out in this regard that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the murder of a trade union leader constitutes a very serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts require severe measures on the part of the authorities to find and condemn those responsible.",0,1982,Chile
284,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Chile in a communication dated  February . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the ICFTU alleges that, at the request of the national body responsible for anti-monopoly supervision, the High Commission against monopolies (an administrative body) adopted on  October  Resolution No.  which imposes on the National Confederation of Leather, Footwear and Allied Industries Workers and four of its leaders fines of , and , pesos per person, respectively. In case of failure to pay, the leaders will be imprisoned, one day in prison corresponding to a fine of ,. pesos.
.The ICFTU explains that at the beginning of  almost all the undertakings in the leather and footwear sector were in the middle of collective bargaining. Because of the importance of these negotiations, the Confederation leaders were advising the unions in the drawing up of draft agreements and were taking part in the negotiations as advisers. Consequently, the drafts which were, presented in the leather sector were more or less all worded in the same manner. According to the ICFTU, the only interest that the sanctioned trade union leaders had was to defend legitimately the rights acquired by their constituents within the provisions of the ""Social Plan"".
.The grounds of the conviction are based on the fact that the trade unions of workers in leather undertakings presented draft collective agreements having an identical formal structure and: similar claims due to the role, of adviser played by the Confederation and its four leaders. These persons were fined because the socio-economic situation had not been taken into account and because the leaders of the first-degree unions had limited themselves to receiving the drafts already drawn up by another body (namely the Confederation) which amounted to a restriction on their freedom of competition.
.The factual situation is considered to be contrary to legislative Decrees Nos. ,  and . In fact, the national body responsible for anti-monopoly supervision considers that, according to these provisions, collective bargaining must exclusively take place within the undertaking taking into account the socio-economic realities of each enterprise. The ICFTU considers that the sentencing of trade union leaders for having advised first-degree unions reduces the capability of these smaller unions to bargain collectively, which implies a restriction on freedom of association.
.In its reply the Government explains that an action was lodged against the National Confederation of Leather, Footwear and Allied Industries Workers for monopolistic practices contrary to free competition in economic activities. Proceedings ensued in which the accused trade union organisation enjoyed all the rights of defence.
.The Anti-Monopoly Commission, composed of a Supreme Court judge, two deans from the University of Santiago and two heads of departments, is an independent governmental tribunal. It handed down a judgement which acknowledged that the prosecution's action was well-founded and held that the behaviour of the trade union organisation had been contrary to free competition in the economic activities of the country. The trade union organisation lodged an appeal before the Supreme Court and the matter is now pending.
.The Committee notes that this matter originated in a restriction imposed on federations and Confederations against participating in collective bargaining, which should take place at the level of the undertaking. In fact, it appears that under sections  and  of Legislative Decree No.  of  bargaining only takes place at the level of the undertaking and federations and Confederations cannot negotiate collectively.
.During its examination of the Chilean trade union legislation, the Committee had recalled that the denial of the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining to federations and Confederations could give rise to serious difficulties in the development of industrial relations, particularly in the case of small unions which, on account of their limited strength and untrained leadership, may not be able by themselves to further and defend the interests of their members in an effective manner. As the Government had stated that monopolistic practices were having a bad effect on the non-unionised workers, small unions, the unemployed, consumers and the economy of the country in general, the Committee had pointed out that where clauses in certain collective agreements appeared to be in opposition to the considerations of the general interest, a procedure could be envisaged by which the attention of the parties is drawn to those considerations so that they can undertake a new examination, it being understood that they are to remain free in the making of their final decision.
.Moreover, the Government had stated that the new legislation does not preclude the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations. It added that these organisations may be of great value in training officials of first-degree trade unions and assisting them prior to or during negotiations. It would therefore appear that the interpretation which has been given to the legislation on collective bargaining is even more restrictive than that which was envisaged at the outset by the Government, since in the present case the accused Confederation and four of its leaders were sentenced to pay severe fines whereas all that they had done was to advise the first-degree trade unions without bargaining directly.
.The Committee accordingly considers that it must insist on the importance of the principle that federations and Confederations must be able to bargain collectively or, if they so wish, participate in the negotiations in which their affiliate organisations are engaged. The Committee notes that this matter is at present pending before the Supreme Court. It expresses the fire hope that the penalties handed down in the first instance on the National Confederation of Leather, Footwear and Allied Industries porkers and on four of its leaders will be lifted. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this affair.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) the Committee insists on the importance of the principle that federations and Confederations must be able to bargain collectively or, if they so wish, participate in the negotiations in which their affiliate organisations are engaged;(b) the Committee expresses the firm hope that the penalties handed down in the first instance on the National Confederation of Leather, Footwear and Allied Industries Workers and four of its leaders will be lifted. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this affair.",0,1982,Chile
285,".In a joint communication dated  October , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITWF) presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Chile. The complainant organisations sent additional information on  and  December . The Government supplied its observations in communications dated  February and  April .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaints, the ICFTU and the ITWF denounce the adoption by the Government of Chile of Act No.  respecting dockworkers.
.In its telegram of  December , the ICFTU protests against the assignment to residence of the Talcahuano maritime workers' trade union leaders, Juliano Troncoso Rodriguez, Reginaldo Troncoso Rodriguez, Juan Cifuentes Gutierrez and Domingo Bravo, who had protested against the adoption of the new Act.
.In their communication of  December , the complainants explain that on  September  Act No.  respecting dockworkers was published in the official Gazette. This law introduces amendments to Legislative Decree No.  of  May  concerning contracts of employment and the protection of workers and to Legislative Decree No.  of  June  concerning the organisation of trade unions. In addition, the new Act adds a new title (Title VI) to Book I of the Labour Code.
.The complainants recall that the amendments previously made to the labour legislation were not applicable to dockworkers because of the specific characteristics and long tradition of the maritime sector. In their view, Act No.  constitutes a serious step backwards as regards the working conditions of dockworkers (formerly called coastal maritime workers). Under the Act, the ""register system"" is done away with and a ""dockworkers' permit"" is established in its place, which means that with the promulgation of the law all of the previously ""registered"" workers found themselves without a job.
.The Act also provides that labour-management relations are to be governed by individual contracts of employment, which presupposes that there will be no more collective bargaining. All of the benefits directly financed by the workers (educational aid, clinics, etc.) have, according to the complainants, been done away with. Lastly, the Act no longer retains the system of appointment by rotation or the employers' obligation to consult the trade union organisations when recruiting staff.
.As regards the persons assigned to residence, the Government states that the persons mentioned in the complaint were arrested on  October  for engaging in activities contrary to public order on  October, the government authorities placed them under house arrest in various towns of the country. These measures were lifted on  November , and since then the persons concerned have enjoyed full freedom to move throughout the territory.
.In respect of the allegations relating to Act No. , the Government states that the ""register system"" has not been removed. The Act merely lays down the obligation to renew registration by a ""dockworkers' permit"", which will be granted only to persons fulfilling certain conditions established by the law. In the Government's view, the only thing that has been done away with is the ""monopolistic"" aspect of the register system allowing discrimination. It is false, the Government adds, to state that the dockworkers have been put out of work. On the contrary, it is the workers themselves who refused to return to work when so requested. In recruiting staff, the Government states, enterprises will give preference to workers previously registered because of their greater experience.
.As regards the allegation that the employers' obligation to consult the trade unions when recruiting staff has been terminated, the Government points out that under the national Constitution no employment or job may be made subject to membership of or withdrawal from an organisation. In this respect, Act No.  puts an end to the monopoly and preferential and discriminatory access to employment enjoyed by , workers in the country, which was highly prejudicial to the , workers illegally employed at the ports.
.As for collective bargaining, the Government states that workers may negotiate with their employers on three bases: individual bargaining, agreements concluded through bargaining between the union of casual workers and the employers, and collective bargaining within a loading and unloading enterprise. In the Government's view, collective bargaining is a procedure for fixing the form of remuneration for services performed by the workers. Consequently, such bargaining must necessarily be carried out between the workers and those requesting their services, on a bilateral basis. The worker is entitled to demand remuneration commensurate with the service he performs, but this demand should not be excessive for the employer or result in transferring the cost to third parties, as negotiation by branch of activity would do. Negotiation by branch of activity incurs a cost for the consumers, the unemployed and the State and leads to a monopolistic situation commonly known as a cartel.
.As regards the allegation that the benefits provided for in the collective agreements concluded between the trade union organisations and the Chilean Maritime Chamber have been done away with, the Government observes that, if freedom of employment and freedom to join trade union organisations are now to exist, the collective agreements in their previous form must be replaced by individual or collective contracts of employment concluded in accordance with the legislation in force. These contracts in future will be concluded directly with the employers.
.The Committee notes first of all that the trade union leaders who had protested against the adoption of Act No.  and who had been placed under house arrest have now been released and are free to move about the country. In this respect, the Committee wishes to stress that assignment to residence, which deprives trade unionists of the opportunity to carry on trade union activities, is a measure incompatible with the normal enjoyment of the right of association.
.As for the Act itself, the Committee observes that some of the allegations made by the complainants do not relate directly to trade union rights but more generally to the working conditions of dockworkers. These allegations therefore do not come within the Committee's competence.
.The Committee must, however, observe that the new legislation respecting dockworkers places serious limitations on collective bargaining, as does the general legislation on the subject, which the Committee examined at the time of its promulgation. The Committee must recall in particular that legislation should not constitute an obstacle to collective bargaining at industry level. It considers that the best procedure for safeguarding the independence of the parties would be to allow them to decide by mutual agreement the level at which bargaining should take place.
.Regarding the abolition of the employers' obligation to consult the trade unions when recruiting staff, the Committee must recall that it has always considered that questions relating to the existence or not of systems of trade union security in a given country should be settled at the national level. Accordingly, the Committee considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that the new legislation respecting dockworkers places serious limitations on collective bargaining. It considers that legislation should not constitute an obstacle to collective bargaining at the industry level.(b) The Committee, believing that the existence or not of systems of trade union security should be settled at the national level, considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.",0,1981,Chile
286,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Chile in a communication dated  November . The Government supplied its observations in a communication of  April .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU in its complaint refers to of the National Confederation of Trade Unions and Federations of Agricultural, Forest, Native and Agro-Industrial Workers ""El Surco"".
.The ICFTU explains that this Confederation was formed on  May  in the presence of a sworn individual designated by the Santiago Provincial Labour Inspectorate. Legal personality was conferred upon it on  June  under the number . It is composed of  first-degree trade unions which are situated throughout the Chilean territory.
.On  November , a Sunday, its headquarters which are situated in Santiago, were broken into and searched by uniformed and plainclothes agents in the absence of any trade union leader. After having emptied the premises and taken away the material and property which belonged to the trade union organisation, the agents in question locked up the premises with padlocks and chains.
.In conclusion, the ICFTU states that this intervention and these dealings on the part of the public authorities impair and restrict the orderly functioning of the affected organisation.
.In its reply the Government explains that Mr. Julio Huenur Loyola, who is not linked directly or indirectly to the Government, owns a building situated at No.  San Diego Street in Santiago which he had let to a lawyer called Mr. Jaime Labarca Vivanco. As the latter had not paid any rent for three months, the landlord decided to visit the building to talk to him. He then discovered that the premises had not been used by the lawyer as had been set out under the terms of the lease, but were unoccupied with the doors open in an obvious state of abandonment except for the propaganda material of the Agricultural Confederation ""El Surco"". In view of this state of affairs, the landlord requested the police to be present when he re-entered his apartment on  November . It was then that propaganda pamphlets were found therein.
.The Government states that it did not participate in any way in the incident in question and that the police acted at the request of an individual without knowing that the building was the headquarters of a trade union organisation. According to the Government, there was no violation of ownership as it was the owner himself who had requested police assistance.
.It is up to the tenant, if he considers that he has been wronged, to appeal to the civil courts for damages to compensate the injury be has suffered. The Government finally states that there has been no violation of an organisation's trade union headquarters.
.The Committee notes the Government's reply respecting the circumstances surrounding the search of the premises. It nevertheless notes that no reply has been provided concerning the allegation that the material and the property of the trade unions has been removed.
.In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that in its Resolution concerning Trade Union Rights and their relation to Civil Liberties, adopted in , the International Labour Conference considered that the right to protection of the property of trade unions constitutes one of the civil liberties essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.",0,1981,Chile
287,".Complaints of infringement of trade union rights were presented against the Government of Chile by the National Revenue Employees' Association (ANEF) and the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International (PTTI) in communications dated  and  November , respectively. Additional information in support of its complaint was supplied by the ANEF on  December .
.The Government, for its part, submitted its observations in communications dated  February and  April .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. .
.In its communication of  November , the ANEF refers to the dismissal of  persons by the Postal and Telegraph Service, including in particular the Association's Vice-President, Hernol Flores, who was also President of the Postal and Telegraph Association and a representative of the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International as well as of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in Chile.
.The ANEF states that Hernol Flores had been an employee of the Postal and Telegraph Service for  years. It also states that section  of the Administrative Statute for Public Employees (Legislative Decree No.  of ) establishes guarantees of irremovability from office for leaders of ANEF associations of public employees during their term of office and for a period of six months thereafter. In order to ensure the necessary independence for the proper performance of their duties as trade union representatives, it also provides that they shall not be transferred or subject to merit rating. Despite these guarantees, the ANEF adds, the Chilean authorities dismissed Hernol Flores by an order published in the Official Gazette on  November .
.In its complaint the PTTI, for its part, states that the dismissals were made without notice and that the chief leaders of the Postal and Telegraph Association of Chile were among the workers dismissed. Besides Hernol Flores, Pedro Ormeho, Secretary-General, and Lino Avila, Administrative Secretary of the Association, also lost their jobs.
.According to the PTTI, the pretext invoked for the dismissals was the transfer of part of mail conveyance to the private sector, rendering  workers redundant. The PTTI considers that this is a most specious pretext since two days after the dismissals, the Director General of the Postal and Telegraph Service announced publicly that, along with the dismissal of the  employees,  persons had been recruited and a large number of auxiliary postmen were to be taken on.
.According to the PTTI, the case of the President of the Postal and Telegraph Association, Hernol Flores, is a particularly instructive example. Since he had been released from his duties to perform trade union functions, it could not be argued that he was dismissed on the ground of redundancy. However, since he no longer belongs to the Postal and Telegraph Administration, he can no longer claim to be a member of the Association and, even less, to be its President. Consequently, it is clear to the PTTI that the measures adopted aim essentially at weakening the union affiliated to it by depriving the union's principal leaders of the possibility of continuing to exercise their trade union functions.
.In its communication of  December , the ANEF refers to the dismissal of other ANEF leaders, namely Juan Seoal Ciscutti, President of the ANEF Provincial Board at Puenta Arenas and an employee of the Directorate of National Property, Patricia Alarcn Pinto, the Secretary of the same Board and an employee of the Directorate of Industry and Commerce, and Ral Muoz Garrido, National Treasurer of the ANEF and inspector at the Ministry of National Property. These persons were excluded from the establishment after their services had been reorganised.
.The ANEF also mentions the case of Aldo Signorelli, a national leader of the ANEF and President of the Employees' Association of the Directorate of Industry and Commerce. This trade union leader was deprived of his job as inspector by Decree No.  of . He appealed to the council of State (Contraloria General), which ruled that the Decree in question was contrary to section  of the Administrative Statute. Despite the Council's ruling, the Government nevertheless dismissed Aldo Signorelli.
.In its reply of  February , the Government states that the dismissal of  employees and the recruitment of  persons at the mail sorting centre are due to a policy of rationalisation and economy within the Postal and Telegraph Service. The maximum staff strength for this Service under the Government's budget for  was fixed at , employees. On  December, the total staff strength was , persons, so that the services had to be reduced by  employees during . An examination of the staff situation for the postal service showed that there was surplus staff in the provinces and insufficient staff in Santiago, which had only . per cent of the staff to handle  per cent of the total traffic. A study of the telegraph service in turn showed that the traffic at  of the  post offices in the country consisted of less than  telegrams daily, which was insufficient for assigning them a telegraph operator. Consequently, these post offices with a telegraph service were converted into post offices with a telephone service not requiring a telegraph operator. The Government also states that contracts for mail conveyance have been concluded with private transport undertakings in the city of Santiago.
.As regards the recruitment of  new workers, the Government explains that these persons have replaced unskilled ancillary staff as well as retired employees. The new staff were recruited to strengthen the mail sorting centre.
.The Government states that the staff members whose jobs have been abolished may retire if they have completed  years of contributions with a social insurance scheme. The ethers are entitled to payment of their last monthly wage for six months, without any deduction.
.The Government concludes that the allegation that the dismissals were made for trade union reasons is unfounded. For example, the  automobile mechanics, including Hernol Flores, were all dismissed because the functions they performed are no longer provided by the Service.
.As regards the dismissals made at the ministry of National Property, the Government states that Juan Seoul Ciscutti and Ral Muoz Garrido were employed on jobs no longer included in the establishment following the reorganisation of the services. Since they have completed  and  years of service, respectively, they may claim their retirement rights. Likewise, the Directorate of Industry and Commerce has been reorganised and its staff strength reduced from  to  employees. Patricia Alarcn Pinto was not retained among the employees according to a strict order of staff selection based on the respective merits of each. The Government points out that she was never a trade union leader, as proved by the fact that her work was evaluated each year, whereas trade union leaders are exempt from such evaluations.
.As regards the dismissal of Aldo Signorelli from the Directorate of Industry and Commerce, the Government states that Mr. Signorelli himself made a written request not to be included in the service's new organisation chart. As proof, the Government supplies a copy of the letter signed by the person concerned.
.In the present case the Committee is asked to consider the dismissal of workers in various sectors of the public service, including the dismissal of trade union leaders of an association of public employees. The explanations which the complainants, on the one hand, and the Government, on the other, give about the reasons for these dismissals are totally different. According to the complainants, these measures were aimed primarily at preventing the trade union leaders concerned from continuing to exercise their functions as workers' representatives, whereas according to the Government the dismissals were due to the need to rationalise the administration.
.It obviously does not fall within the Committee's competence to decide on the desirability of making dismissals for economic or administrative reasons. The Committee must, however, point out that acts of anti-union discrimination should not take place under the pretext of such circumstances.
.In the present case, the Committee observes that the directorates of the administrations concerned, far from trying to retain the trade union leaders in employment, on the contrary dismissed a large number, while at the same time recruiting new employees. The Committee therefore considers it necessary to draw the Government's attention to the importance which it attaches to effective protection, both in law and in fact, against any acts of anti-union discrimination which may be committed against trade union leaders. In view of the foregoing considerations, the Committee also considers it necessary to request the Government to re-examine the situation of the dismissed trade unionists with a view to their reinstatement in their administration.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that acts of anti-union discrimination should not take place under the pretext of dismissals for economic reasons and recalls the importance which it attaches to",0,1981,Chile
288,"effective protection, both in law and in fact against any acts of antiunion discrimination which may be committed against trade union leaders.(b) The Committee requests the Government to re-examine the situation of the dismissed trade unionists with a view to their reinstatement in their administration.",-1,1981,Chile
289,".In a communication dated  June , the Confederation of Private Employees of Chile (CEPCH) presented a complaint alleging the infringement of trade union rights in Chile. For its part the Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint concerns the dismissal of Mr. Walter Antognini Ibacache, one of the national leaders of CEPCH, and the declaration of his legal incapacity made by the Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
.The complainant organisation explains that Mr. Antognini had been working at the National Vocational Training Institute (INACAP) since  September . This Institute is a private undertaking which is dependent upon a public body the Production Development Corporation, the executive Committee of which includes representatives of the Ministry of Labour. Since May , Mr. Antognini has been one of the national leaders of CEPCH, a fact which had been duly made known to the Labour Directorate and his employer.
.On  April , i.e., on the eve of the company union elections, INACAP informed Mr. Antognini of his dismissal on grounds attributable to the operating requirements of the undertaking. CEPCH adds that INACAP had not given the statutory  days' advance notice and had decided to compensate this lack of advance notice by the payment of a sum of money, although such payments are not allowed under the law. As indicated in a report from the labour inspectorate attached to the complaint, Mr. Antognini obtained a majority of votes in the trade union elections of  April; in the presence of a labour inspector, he had a meeting with the chief of personnel of the undertaking who refused to reinstate him. Mr. Antognini then filed a complaint of unjustified dismissal with the competent courts.
.On  May , the Labour Directorate declared that Mr. Antognini was not legally qualified to exercise the functions of leader of the company trade union since he no longer fulfilled the requirements for such a post established by the law. Mr. Antognini then lodged an appeal requesting that the decision to disqualify him be considered illegal.
.The Government states firstly that INACAP is a private undertaking and that its administration management and financing are autonomous and independent from the Ministry of Labour and the governmental authorities.
.It points out that in accordance with Act No. . of  and Legislative Decree No.  of  undertakings may terminate a contract of employment with their workers for one of the reasons mentioned in these texts. One of these reasons concerns grounds attributable to the operating requirements of the undertaking and is used to make adjustments in the size of the workforce in the light of production needs. Workers who are dismissed may appeal to the labour courts which, in the event of unjustified dismissals, may order the reinstatement of the workers concerned or, in the event of a refusal by the employer, order the latter to pay compensation equal to at least  days' earnings for each year and a half worked.
.In the present case, the undertaking made use of the dismissal procedure set forth above and the worker concerned has made an application which is currently before the civil courts for a declaration of unjustified dismissal.
.In conclusion, the Government states that no discriminatory or oppressive measures were taken against the worker in question. It adds that the decision of the court will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as it is delivered.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns the dismissal of one of the leaders of the Confederation of Private Employees of Chile (CEPCH) by his employer, the National Vocational Training Institute (INACAP). This dismissal led to a declaration by the Labour Directorate concerning the legal incapacity of the worker to exercise his trade union functions.
.As regards the dismissal, the Committee is unable, on the basis of information currently at its disposal, to determine whether the worker was dismissed for economic reasons as stated by the employer and the Government, or whether the dismissal was the result of anti-trade union discrimination, as alleged by the complainant. The Committee considers that the text of the decision concerning the application made for a declaration of unjustified dismissal could provide it with additional information. It notes in this respect that the Government has indicated that the decision will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as it is delivered. However, the Committee can at this stage note that the worker concerned had been employed by the company for a period of thirteen years' had for the last six years been a trade union leader, and was dismissed on the eve of his election as leader of the company union a dismissal which was illegal according to the provisions of section  of Legislative Decree No.  which requires the employer to obtain prior permission from a court before dismissing a trade union leader.
.As regards the declaration of legal incapacity the Committee notes that this decision was made in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  respecting the organisation of trade unions, which stipulates that a person must, in order to be elected to the executive Committee of a company trade union, be employed by the undertaking concerned.
.In the particular circumstances of the case, the Committee cannot but reach the conclusion that the action thus taken by the company had the effect of impeding the right of a workers, organisation to elect its representatives in full freedom and was accordingly contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee considers that the dismissal of Mr. Antognini had the effect of impeding the right of a workers' organisation to elect its representatives in full freedom and requests the Government to inform it of the results of the judicial proceedings underway.",0,1981,Chile
290,".In a communication dated  May , the Coordinadora Nacional Sindical (CNS) presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Chile. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, in a letter dated  June , enclosing the text of the CNS's complaint, stated that the allegations made had its full support. The Government, for its part, supplied its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CNS alleges, first of all, that the Government prohibited nine trade union organisations having legal personality from holding a meeting of workers on May Day when these organisations had complied with all of the obligations provided for in the labour legislation, having requested the authorisation of the competent police inspector. However, on  April the police authorities had notified the administrator of the premises where the meeting was to be held that any meeting or demonstration was prohibited and consequently that he should refrain from allowing the premises to be used. In addition, the Minister of the Interior had publicly stated that any meeting held on the occasion of May Day, besides that called by the Government itself, would be repressed.
.This warning, according to the CNS, was carried out, and the workers who had gathered at the doors to the hall where the meeting was to be held were violently dispersed by the police and agents of the National Central Information Agency. The CNS leaders then requested the workers to withdraw peacefully.
.However, according to the complainant organisation,  persons were arrested on May Day in the city of Santiago. In other areas of the country as well (Valparaiso, Concepcin, Iquique), meetings called by trade unions were prohibited and  persons arrested. At the time of sending the complaint,  persons whose names are listed in the communication were still held by the National Central information Agency.
.On  May , the CNS continues, the Minister of the Interior placed under house arrest, in various isolated places in the far south of the country,  workers and students who had been held since  May. These persons were to remain in those places for three months.
.Furthermore, the Chairman of the National Federation of Textile Workers, Fernando Bobadilla, was arrested on  May by Agents, of the National Central Information Agency when he was returning from the headquarters of the National Association of Public Employees. According to the complainant organisation, he was subjected to psychological torture to make him divulge information about the Coordinadora Nacional Sindical. Mr. Bobadilla subsequently lodged an ""appeal for protection"" with the Santiago Court of Appeal describing in detail the interrogation to which he had been subjected.
.The complaint then refers to physical assaults by uniformed police against miners in the El Teniente area at Rancagua, mentioning in particular incidents that occurred on , ,  and  May during peaceful demonstrations. During one of these,  persons were arrested, including  miners and  women and young persona. As a result of ill-treatment, two workers' arms were broken. Furthermore, on  May, when the miners' wives were protesting against the arrests by beating on empty pots, the police broke violently into the buildings, throwing tear-gas bombs, and proceeded to arrest several mothers of families, who were subsequently released
.Lastly, the CNS mentions the situation of , Mapuche Indian peasants whose co-operative at Lumaco has been taken over by the Government. The peasants are in jeopardy of losing their land owing to the mismanagement of government officials. Their leaders have been thrown into jail after denouncing the abuses committed against the indigenous population. The CNS adds that a co-operative trade union has been organised by these peasants.
.Concerning the May Day celebrations, the Government denies that there was any general prohibition of meetings it states that all organisations were able to meet freely in their premises to examine their problems, and that this occurred throughout the country. The meeting to which the complaint refers was a public meeting in a theatre, outside the trade union headquarters, and without prior authorisation by the police. The Government recalls that, since the country is in a state of emergency, such an authorisation must be obtained prior to holding a public meeting.
.The Government adds that large-scale arrests were not made and that if some persons were arrested, the arrests were made to prevent disturbance of the peace and in no case on account of trade union celebrations held in the organisations' premises of the persons listed by the complainants, the Government was able to find information about seven who are being held in a public prison. These persons are charged with breaking the law on state security and Decree No. , to dissolve political parties and prohibit activities for promoting doctrines involving a concept of man and society contrary to the dignity of human beings and the values of freedom and Christianity which are part of the national tradition"". These persons were members of a propaganda cell of those political parties. The case against them is now in first instance and the public prosecutor's report is awaited. The accused will be entitled to appeal when the sentence is handed down. It appears therefore to be clear, according to the Government, that the reason for their arrest was not the celebration of May Day or any facts connected with freedom of association. Nor are they being held, as the complainants falsely assert, in secret places.
.Concerning the measures of house arrest, the Government points out that the president of the Republic has the right to take such measures under the Constitution approved by referendum on  September . This presidential right, which is of a transitional nature, is exercised when acts of violence are committed that affect law and order or when the peace is likely to be disturbed. It has been exercised in a limited number of cases against habitual agitators. Moreover, the persons concerned may appeal to the authorities for a review of the case. The Government reaffirms that this exceptional measure has never been used to repress the exercise of trade union rights.
.Regarding the arrest of Mr. Fernando Bobadilla, the Government points out that under article  of the Constitution any person arrested in violation of existing legislation or illegally threatened in his right to personal freedom and individual safety may appeal to the courts to adopt measures to re-establish the exercise of his rights and ensure his protection. This is what has happened in the case in question, Mr. Bobadilla having lodged an appeal for protection with the Santiago Court of Appeal. On this point, the Government concludes that Mr. Bobadilla has been released.
.The action taken by the police in the case of the strike at El Teniente was intended to maintain peace and order which political activists not connected with the mine aimed at disrupting. No worker or trade union leader at the mine was arrested for participating in the legal strike.
.The allegations relating to the Indian peasants of the Lumaco co-operative, according to the Government, have to do with the financial administration of an agricultural enterprise governed by the general law on co-operatives. The Government adds that the Committee on Freedom of Association is not competent to take a position on the economic management of an enterprise and that no violation of labour legislation was committed. In the Government's opinion, this is a matter that has no relation to freedom of association.
.The CNS's complaint relates essentially to events which occurred during the celebration of May Day in . Other allegations relate to incidents that occurred during a strike at the copper mines in the El Teniente area and in an agricultural cooperative of indigenous peasants.
.The Committee observes that it has had before it for five consecutive years' allegations concerning impediments to the celebration of May Day in Chile. In this connection it must stress, as it has done on several occasions' in conjunction with Case No.  relating to Chile, that the holding of public meetings and the voicing of demands of a social and economic nature are traditional forms of trade union action on the occasion of May Day. Trade unions should have the right to organise freely whatever meetings they wish to celebrate May Day, provided public order is respected. In the case in question, an authorisation to hold the meeting had been requested and the trade unions organising the meeting had planned to hold it in closed premises. It does not therefore appear that any particular disturbance of the peace was to be feared.
.In addition, the incidents which took place on May Day led to measures of detention and house arrest. It emerges from the Government's reply, in particular, that seven persons who, according to the complainants, had been arrested on May Day, are still being held pending trial before the courts. Other persons were placed under house arrest in isolated",0,1981,Chile
291,"places, a decision taken outside any judicial procedure. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the right of all accused persons to enjoy the benefits of normal judicial procedures. In these circumstances, the Committee must stress, as it has already done in cases relating to Chile, that the persons arrested during a demonstration organised by a trade union - which appears to be the case of the demonstration to which the allegations refer - should be released or, if they are accused of crimes, be judged within a normal period of time by impartial and independent courts. The Committee would like to be kept informed of the results of the court proceedings brought against the seven persons in question.
.Concerning the arrest of Mr. Fernando Bobadilla, a well-known trade union leader in Chile, the Committee must recall that the arrest of a trade unionist against whom no charge is brought involves restrictions to freedom of association. Governments should adopt measures for issuing appropriate instructions to prevent the danger involved for trade union activities by such arrests. It is also clear that such measures create an atmosphere of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities.
.Concerning the allegations relating to police intervention during the strike at El Teniente, the Committee, while noting the Government's statement that the persons arrested were agitators not connected with the mine, observes that, according to detailed information supplied in the complaints, the police intervened frequently during the dispute and proceeded to arrest miners and the wives of strikers. In this connection, the Committee wishes to stress that in cases of strike movements the authorities should resort to the use of force only in serious situations where law and order is seriously threatened.
.Lastly, the Committee notes, concerning the allegations relating to the indigenous peasants of the Lumaco co-operative, that in the Government's view this matter has nothing to do with freedom of association. The Committee observes however that the leaders of the peasants who, according to the complainants, were arrested - which the Government has not denied - intervened to defend the peasants' economic interests with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and that they have organised a trade union. Before being arrested, they had therefore acted as workers' representatives. The Committee expresses the hope that a rapid solution will be found in this matter and that no definite action will be taken against the peasant leaders for reasons connected with the performance of their functions as representatives.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:The Committee recalls that trade unions should have the right to organise freely whatever meetings they wish to celebrate May Day, provided that public order is respected.Noting that persons arrested on May Day are still being held in prison and that others have been placed under house arrest in isolated places, the Committee wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the right of all accused persons to enjoy the benefits of normal judicial procedures. It also stresses that the persons arrested during a demonstration organised by a trade union should be released or, if they are accused of crimes, be tried within the normal period of time by impartial and independent courts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the court proceedings brought against the seven persons mentioned in its communication.Concerning the arrest of Mr. Bobadilla, the Committee points out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no charge is brought involves restrictions to freedom of association. Such measures also could create an atmosphere of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities.In respect of the police intervention during the strike at El Teniente, the Committee considers that in cases of strike movements the authorities should resort to the use of force only in serious situations where law and order is seriously threatened.Lastly, the Committee expresses the hope that a rapid solution will be found in the case of the Lumaco co-operative and that no definite action will be taken against the peasant leaders for reasons connected with performance of their functions as representatives.",1,1981,Chile
292,".In a communication dated  February , the National Trade Union Confederation of Workers in the Construction, Timber, Building Materials and Allied industries presented a complaint alleging the infringement of trade union rights by the Government of Chile. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisation refers to the dismissal by the Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of four of its national leaders, namely Messrs. Hector Cuevas Salvador, Chairman; Sergio Troncoso Cisternas; Hector Solis Saavedra, the officer responsible for industrial relations; and Edelmiro Aravena Lastra, the officer responsible for social welfare.
.In an appendix to its communication, the complainant organisation includes various documents in support of its complaint, in particular its charter, Resolution No.  of the Labour Directorate promulgated on  February  respecting the declaration of the legal incapacity of the four leaders of the Confederation as well as the appeal lodged by the complainant organisation with the labour courts.
.It appears from these various documents that the complainant organisation, which comprises  trade unions from different parts of the country, was established on  November  in the presence of a witness on oath. During this meeting, a board of management composed of  members was elected in accordance with the regulations. The charter and the statutes of the organisation, as well as the list of its leaders, were registered in accordance with the law with the Santiago provincial Labour Inspectorate on  November .
.On examining these documents, the Labour Directorate discovered that the constituent organisations of the Confederation included two first-degree trade unions from the Greater Santiago area which had been dissolved in  as a result of their affiliation to another organisation which itself had been dissolved by Legislative Decree No.  of October , the former Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Construction Workers. As a result of this situation, these two trade unions did not, in the view of the Labour Directorate, enjoy legal personality and their representatives could not therefore sit on the Confederation and in particular on its executive bodies. The Labour Directorate therefore issued a resolution which dismissed the four leaders who represented these two trade unions and had been elected to the steering Committee of the federation and ordered them to cease exercising their functions immediately.
.The complainant organisation considers that the resolution of the Labour Directorate was an arbitrary decision totally devoid of any legal basis. It points out in particular that the leaders concerned were not given the opportunity to express their views and were thus unable to state their case. As regards the situation of the two trade unions affected by the declaration of legal incapacity, the complainant organisation points out that one of the trade unions had enjoyed legal personality since  and the other since . After the adoption of new trade union legislation in Chile in , the two organisations in question amended their statutes accordingly and held new elections. The two unions subsequently received documents on several occasions in  and  from the Labour Directorate which accredit their legal status.
.As regards the motive for the alleged dissolution of these two trade unions, namely their affiliation to an organisation which itself had been dissolved, the former Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Construction Workers, the complainant recognises that section  of the legislative decree concerning the dissolution also applied to the organisations which were affiliated to the Federation. It points out, however, that shortly after this Federation had been dissolved, the Labour Directorate declared that the affiliated organisations were to retain their legal personality until the Ministry of the Interior had drawn up a detailed list of the organisations concerned. For its part, the Ministry of the Interior had also stated that only federations had been dissolved and that the Ministry would specify subsequently what effects these dissolutions would have on the member organisations. The complainant organisation therefore believes that the Labour Directorate was not legally competent to issue a decision on the legal existence of the two trade unions in question. As a consequence, it has made an application to the labour courts requesting the annulment of the declaration of legal incapacity issued by the Labour Directorate.
.The Government states firstly that the new Chilean trade union legislation of  (Legislative Decree No. ) grants trade unions the right to establish federations and Confederations and to affiliate to such organisations provided that the latter have been established in accordance with the law or have made the necessary amendments for this purpose. It points out that the exercise of freedom of association is guaranteed under the law to all trade unions, but that on the contrary non-trade union bodies such as de facto organisations which do not enjoy legal personality are not entitled to exercise trade union rights.
.As regards the boards of management of federations and Confederations, the law requires that their members are leaders of an affiliated organisation (section  of Legislative Decree No. ). The Government points out that the persons who were dismissed in February  represented de facto organisations which did not enjoy the status of trade union organisations as required by the law since the organisations in question had been dissolved by Legislative Decree in October . Since these organisations did not legally exist, they were not entitled to participate in the establishment of a trade union organisation of a federative nature. Consequently, its representatives did not possess the legal status of trade union leaders since they did not fulfil the requirements established by section  of the above-mentioned Legislative Decree. The Labour Directorate was therefore obliged to adopt a resolution declaring that the persons concerned were not legally authorised to exercise a trade union function.
.In conclusion, the Government points out that section  of Legislative Decree No.  grants the right to appeal against resolutions of the administrative authorities declaring the legal incapacity or incompatibility to exercise trade union functions and that this right is exercised in the civil courts. The case in question is currently before the Santiago civil court. The Government states that once the court has delivered its judgement, it will be transmitted to the Committee.
.The present case concerns the declaration by the Labour Directorate of the legal incapacity of four persons who had been elected in November  as leaders of the National Trade Union Confederation of Workers in the Construction, Timber, Building Materials and Allied Industries. This declaration of legal incapacity was based upon the fact that the persons concerned did not fulfil all the requirements established by the law for persons to be elected as trade union leaders since they represented first degree trade unions which in the view of the Government, had been dissolved at an earlier date and which therefore did not enjoy any legal existence. The persons in question could not therefore be considered as the leaders of an affiliated organisation and consequently could not be elected to the executive bodies of the Confederation. In the view of the complainant, the declaration of legal incapacity was an arbitrary measure since the authorities themselves had recognised the legal existence of the trade unions concerned in various documents.
.As regards the motive for the decision to declare legal incapacity - i.e. the dissolution of the former Industrial Federation of Building wood and Construction Workers which according to the Government resulted in the dissolution of its affiliated organisations and, therefore, of the two trade unions of which the leaders in question were members - the Committee notes that this case of dissolution had already been the subject of a complaint which it had examined on several occasions. The Committee had noted that the procedure followed in this case was not compatible with the principles of freedom of association since the dissolution had been made by administrative authority. Furthermore, the Government had stated at the time in connection with this Case that the organisations affiliated to the dissolved groups were not concerned by the dissolution measures. The reasons now invoked for the annulment of the election of trade union leaders of the building Confederation thus seem to contradict the previous statements of the Government concerning the legal existence of the first-degree trade unions in question.
.In addition to the ambiguous nature of the motives thus put forward the Committee must point out that the declaration of legal incapacity in question was made by an administrative authority, namely the Labour Directorate, and that it came into force immediately after its adoption. In this respect, the Committee considers it necessary to recall, as it has done on many occasions, the importance of the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee believes that in order to prevent such interference,",0,1981,Chile
293,"measures for the dismissal, suspension or disqualification of trade union officials should not become enforceable except on the basis of a sentence on the part of the competent judicial authority or, in any case, after the period allowed for the submission of an appeal has elapsed.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the case has now been placed before the civil courts and that the Government will transmit the results of the proceedings when the court has made its decision.
.In these circumstances' the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:Noting that the disqualification of the four trade union leaders referred to in the complaint was made by administrative authority, the Committee recalls that measures for the dismissal, suspension or disqualification of trade union leaders should not become enforceable except or the basis of a sentence by the competent judicial authority or, in any case after the period allowed for the submission of an appeal has elapsed. The Committee therefore considers that the measure taken by the Labour Directorate did not comply with the principles of freedom of association.The Committee notes that the case has now been placed before the civil courts and that the Government will transmit the results of the proceedings when the court has delivered its decision.",-1,1981,Chile
294,".The Committee has examined this case on several occasions and, in particular, at its May  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.The Government has supplied its observations in a communication of  September .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its May  Session, the Committee had reached interim conclusions on the outstanding aspect of the case, namely the proceedings against ten leaders of the National Trade Union Coordination Body (Coordinadora Nacional Sindical), (CNS), including Messrs. Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, respectively President and General Secretary of that organisation. The Committee had noted that these two leaders were no longer imprisoned. However, considering the new allegations that they and eight other leaders of the CNS had been sentenced by the Appeal Court to  days' imprisonment and that they would serve their sentence if the appeal they had brought was rejected, the Committee had stressed the danger to the free exercise of trade union rights of measures of detention and sentencing of workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the interests of the persons they represent. Noting that appeals had been brought, the Committee had requested the Government to keep it informed of the results of the case.
.Furthermore, the Committee had asked to be kept informed of any developments in two other aspects of the case: the inquiries into the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists, and of developments in trade union legislation.
.In its letter of  September , the Government points out that on  June , the Ministry of the Interior dropped the judicial action it had taken against ten leaders of the illegal organisation Coordinadora Nacional Sindical on the grounds that they had usurped the role of workers' representatives in violation of Decree No.  of . The examining magistrate had accepted that the judicial action be abandoned and ordered the withdrawal of the action from the list of current proceedings and the filing away of all the information in the dossier. The Ministry of the Interior's decision to drop the case has the effect of cancelling the criminal action and quashing the sentence passed at first instance.
.The Government makes it clear that its aim in adopting this measure is to enable the accused to change their behaviour.
.The Government attaches to its letter the Minister of the Interior's letter abandoning the proceedings, and the decisions taken by the examining magistrate.
.The Committee notes with interest that the judicial proceedings against the leaders of the Coordinadora National Sindical have been dropped and that the prison sentences passed at first instance have been quashed. The Committee is convinced that these measures will help to restore a climate favourable to the development of industrial relations in the country. It expresses the firm hope that it will now be possible to establish constructive social relations between Government, employers' organisations and workers' unions of all tendencies.
.Finally, as the Government's reply contains no information on the trade union legislation and the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists, the Committee must recall that it wishes to be kept informed of any developments in the matter of trade union legislation, as well as of the development of the inquiries under way into the disappearances. It urges the Government to adopt amendments to bring the trade union law into conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that the proceedings brought against the leaders of the Coordinadora Nacional Sindical have been dropped and that the prison sentences passed at first instance have been quashed. It expresses the firm hope that it will now be possible to establish constructive social relations between the Government, employers' organisations and trade unions of all tendencies.(b) The Committee again urges the Government to adopt amendments to bring the trade union law into conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments as regards the trade union legislation.(c) The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of the inquiries under way into the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions and, in particular, at its meeting in November  when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since then, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has supplied further information in telegrams dated  and  December  and  and  May .
.The Government supplied its observations in two communications dated  February and  April .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its November  Session the Committee had reached interim conclusions on two aspects of the case. On the one hand, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the results of the legal proceedings pending against two leaders of the national Trade Union Co-ordination Body (Coordinadora Nacional Sindical) (CNS), Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn who, according to the complainants, had been arrested for presenting a list of demands on behalf of their organisation. On the other hand, the Committee had requested the Government to supply its observations on the dismissal of  workers of the Panal Textile Undertaking, allegedly as a result of their trade union activities during the -day strike which had been organised in that undertaking.
.Furthermore, the Committee had asked to be kept informed of any subsequent developments concerning two other aspects of the case, viz. the inquiries undertaken into the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and the trade union legislation.
.In its telegram dated  December  the ICFTU refers to the arrest on  and  December  of two advisers of the CNS and the executive secretary of the Chile Committee for Human Rights, Eugenio Diaz Corvalan, Sergio Aguil and Germn Molina Valdiviego.
.In its telegram dated  December , the ICFTU states that it had been informed that the prosecution authorities considered that there was not sufficient evidence to prosecute Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn. In spite of that, the ICFTU adds, the Court decided to prosecute them and the case will be referred to the Supreme Court. The ICFTU recalls that the activities of the two trade unionists were always in accordance with the mandate conferred on them by the Chilean workers, and it calls for their release.
.Commenting on the Committees previous conclusions on the proceedings against Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, the Government recalls, in particular, that the CNS has no legal existence, and that  trade union organisations stated that they would not sign the ""register of national demands"" prepared by the CNS even though the latter mentioned them among its affiliates. The Government stated that the demands submitted were not social and occupational, and that the legislation offers the broadest freedom to form federations and Confederations.
.As regards the situation of the two trade union leaders in question, the Government recalls that they had violated the provisions of section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  concerning the usurping of trade union representation. Nevertheless, the persons concerned were released on  December . Their trials are at the investigatory stage and it is hoped that the investigating magistrate will soon hand down his decision.
.As regards the dismissal of workers of the Panal Textile Undertaking, the Government observes that the allegations were contained in a document drawn up by a body known as the ""Sole Central Trade Union Organisation of Chilean Workers"" which has no legal existence. On the substance of the matter, the Government explains that two collective bargaining procedures were engaged in at the Panal undertaking, corresponding to each of the existing trade unions.
.Negotiations with trade union No.  began on  August  and ended on  October  with the signing of a collective agreement. A strike was voted for on  September but it finally did not take place. Negotiations with trade union No.  began on  August  and ended on  December . In accordance with the law, the workers demanded that the employer sign a new collective agreement under the conditions obtaining at the time when the draft agreement was first presented- with these conditions being, however, updated and subject to readjustment. The workers went on strike from  October to  December , the date on which they went back to work. From  to  January  the management of the enterprise terminated the contracts of  workers for dishonesty, acts of violence, insults or serious immoral conduct, absence from work for two days without explanation and the operational requirements of the undertaking. Only two of these dismissed workers",1,1975,Chile
295,"presented an appeal for wrongful dismissal to the labour authorities: one received compensation equivalent to US$, and the other dropped his appeal. Of the  dismissed workers,  belong to trade union No. ,  to trade union No.  and one is not a member of any organisation. According to the Government, it appears from this information that there was no anti-union victimisation at the enterprise.
.As regards the ICFTU allegations concerning the arrest of Messrs. Eugenio Diaz, Sergio Aguilo and Germn Molina, the Government points out that it is incorrect to state that the first two were arrested for being the legal advisers of the CNS, since other people were the group's lawyers. The three persons concerned are leaders of a dissolved political party and were arrested and prosecuted for offences relating to Legislative Decree No.  of  October  which declares various political parties illegal and dissolved, and to the law on state security and the control of arms. According to the Government, their arrest accordingly has nothing to do with trade union reasons since none of them was a trade union leader or engaged in trade union activities. The Government states that these persons have been free since  April  in accordance with a Supreme Court order.
.In its telegram of  May , the ICFTU alleges that the Chilean Appeal Court has sentenced to  days' imprisonment the CNS leaders Manuel Bustos, Alamiro Guzmn, Sergio Freyhofer, Germn Jofre, Luis Suarez, Jos Verasay, Manuel Jimnez, Humberto Vergara, Arturo Martinez and Carlos Apazo. The Appeal Court based its decision on the violation of Legislative Decree No. . The sentenced trade union leaders have lodged an appeal before the Supreme Court of Chile. If the appeal fails, Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn will be imprisoned until they have completed the above-mentioned sentence.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government on the prosecution of the two leaders of the CNS, Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, and in particular that they are no longer imprisoned. However, since - according to the new allegations - the Chilean Court of Appeal has sentenced not only Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, but also  other CNS leaders, to  days' imprisonment for the violation of legislative Decree No.  concerning trade union representation and since the sentenced leaders will be forced to complete their sentence if their appeal before the Supreme Court fails, the Committee would stress that the adoption of measures of detention and sentencing against workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights. Noting that appeal proceedings are still under way the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the matter.
.Concerning the dismissals of workers from the Panal undertaking, while noting the Government's explanations on the nature of the reasons for the dismissals in question, the Committee must note that these measures came very shortly after action had been undertaken by the trade union organisations of the undertaking in support of their claims, and in particular after a fairly protracted strike. In these circumstances the Committee cannot but establish a link between the labour disputes involving the trade unions and the management of the undertaking and the dismissals which were subsequently announced. In this respect the Committee must point out that when trade union members and leaders are dismissed for having exercised their right to strike, which is one of the essential means whereby workers and workers' organisations can promote and defend their interests, there is reason to conclude that they have been penalised for their trade union activities and are subject to anti-union discrimination, contrary to the principle of freedom of association. Consequently, the Committee would recall that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination both in law and in practice.
.As regards the new allegations concerning measures of arrest taken in respect of three persons in December , the Committee must note that the fact that the persons concerned are trade union leaders has not been established by the complainants, any more than the connections between trade union activity and the measures of arrest. While regretting these measures which affect persons, one of whom seems to have been engaged in promoting and defending human rights, the Committee considers that these allegations do not come within its terms of reference. Moreover, it notes that they have been released.
.Finally, the Committee recalls that it wishes to be kept informed of developments in the area of trade union legislation and of the outcome of the judicial proceedings concerning the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzman are no longer imprisoned. However, since the new allegations state that they have been sentenced - along with  other CNS leaders - by the Court of Appeal to  days' imprisonment and since they will be forced to complete their sentence if their appeal before the Supreme Court fails, the Committee stresses that the adoption of measures of detention and sentencing against workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights. Noting that appeal proceedings are under way, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the matter.(b) Regarding the dismissals of workers at the Panal undertaking, the Committee cannot but establish a connection between the labour disputes involving the trade unions and the management of the undertaking and the subsequent dismissals. It reminds the Government that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination both in law and in practice.(c) As regards the arrest of three persons in December , the Committee considers that these allegations do not come within its terms of reference and that consequently this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in the matter of trade union legislation.(e) The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial proceedings under way concerning the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions and in particular at its February  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have sent the ILO the following communications: the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (communications dated  March,  May,  and  July ); the Trades Union International of Workers in the Metal Industry ( June ); the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) (, ,  and  July ,  August ); National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) (,  and  July ); the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) ( July ); the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) ( July ); the International Federation of Teachers' Unions (IFTU) ( July ); the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees ( July ).
.For its part, the Government forwarded observations in a letter dated  September .
.At its session in February , the Committee had adopted interim conclusions on one of the aspects of the case, namely the arrest of two trade union leaders: Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, chairman and secretary-general respectively of the CNS. The Committee had requested the Government to inform it of the results of the legal proceedings taken against these two persons.
.Furthermore, the Committee had asked to be kept informed of any subsequent developments concerning two other aspects of the case: the inquiries undertaken into the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and trade union legislation.
.In its communication of  March , the WFTU alleges the arrest on  March of Luis Vergara, President of the Glass Federation and Carlos Gonzales, leader of the Coal Federation.
.The WFTU includes with its communication of  May  a report of the external Committee of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean workers. In addition to allegations already examined by the Committee, the report refers to the situation of  workers who were allegedly dismissed from the Panal Textile Undertaking because of their trade union activities during a lawful strike lasting  days which had been organised in this undertaking.
.The other communications from the complainants concern the arrest of ten leaders of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS). This organisation explains in particular in a communication dated  July , that in accordance with requests made by trade union leaders in November  at the organisation's national advisory meeting, the CNS has drawn up a list of demands, now referred to as the ""register of national demands"", which was approved by  trade union organisations and , leaders who represented, according to the complainant organisation, , workers.",-1,1975,Chile
296,"The national executive of the CNS was instructed to present the register of demands to the governmental authorities. The main demands concerned legislation on work contracts, the recognition of greater freedom of association, the extension of collective bargaining, wage adjustments, social security reform and housing.
.The CNS requested an interview with the Minister of Labour on  June in order to deliver the register of demands, but the request was refused. The register was therefore sent to him by post. The minister of the Interior then instituted legal proceedings against  national trade union leaders, all members of the CNS executive. These trade unionists were accused of arrogating the right of representing workers without being legally qualified to assume such functions and of political proselytism and militancy. Under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , the first of these charges is punishable by prison sentences running from  days to  years and under the National Security Act, the second charge is punishable by imprisonment and exile. The Minister of the Interior also made use of the power conferred on him by the new Constitution to request the Constitutional court to apply the provisions of article  of the Constitution concerning acts of totalitarism and terrorism. The Constitutional court must decide as a matter of conscience whether the accused are guilty or innocent and what penalties should be imposed. Furthermore, according to the CNS, the authorities summoned each of the trade unions which had signed the register of demands and threatened to dissolve them if they did not withdraw their signatures.
.On Tuesday,  July, all the trade union leaders against whom proceedings had been instigated were summoned to appear before the examining magistrate. They were immediately arrested and transferred to the Santiago public prison. Only Juan Manuel Seplveda, the CNS officer in charge of international relations escaped this fate since he was on a trade union mission in Europe. The CNS points out that its chairman Manuel Bustos and secretary-general Alamiro Guzmn had already been prosecuted by the Ministry of the Interior for the same offence and had been given a suspended sentence of  days of imprisonment by the Court of First Instance; as a consequence, they will now have to serve the sentence without any possibility of a new suspension being granted. The ICFTU subsequently informed the ILO of the release of eight of the CNS leaders so that only Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn are still being detained.
.In a telegram dated  August , the ICFTU reported the expulsion to Argentina of Chilean lawyers who had agreed to defend the accused trade union leaders before the courts.
.The Government points out that technical amendments were made to legislation respecting trade union organisations with a view to bringing the texts into line with the country's political Constitution, approved in a referendum held in September . It adds that the advisability or otherwise of introducing new amendments to national legislation is a matter exclusively within its sovereign rights, in accordance with its policy and the national interest. The Government states that employers' and workers' organisations were consulted on a permanent basis during the preparation of the respective bills.
.As regards the judicial proceedings concerning the trade unionists who have disappeared, the Government states once again that these cases are being investigated and fall within the competence of the ordinary judicial authorities. The Government will transmit any new information of interest to the Committee.
.As regards the initial legal proceedings taken against Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn in January , the Government points out that the examining magistrate issued his findings at the beginning of April and that in June the accused were given a suspended sentence of  days imprisonment. The accused appealed to the Court of Appeal which upheld the original sentence. The defence counsel then lodged a new appeal, known as a ""complaints appeal"", with the Supreme Court. The latter, in a judgement delivered in August , also upheld the original verdict.
.The allegations made in connection with the arrest of two trade unionists, Luis Vergara and Carlos Gonzales, are, according to the Government, unfounded. It explains that there is no trace of their having been arrested and that these persons are not known in the sectors of activity mentioned by the complainants since the organisations of which they are said to be leaders enjoy no legal or de facto existence.
.As regards the proceedings taken against the leaders of the CNS, the Government states, on the basis of the relevant texts in force, that Chilean law guarantees all citizens full freedom of association, and that they may freely establish, join or withdraw from trade union organisations. Furthermore, under section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , associations or groups of persons which represent workers without having the legal capacity to do so are declared contrary to the public order and the national security. According to the Government, this provision protects the activity of legitimately elected leaders, since otherwise it would be impossible for workers to distinguish between legally established organisations and de facto organisations which are established and dissolved without statutes and in accordance with interests not shared by the workers.
.The Government continues that, despite the clarity of these provisions, a group of former militants from dissolved political parties set itself up as the leader of an organisation, called the National Trade Onion Co-ordinating Body, established completely outside the law. This group, claiming to represent all Chilean workers, addressed a document called ""register of national demands"" to the President of the Republic which practically requested the repeal of trade union legislation. The offence committed was not the fact of having presented a request to the head of State, but rather that the group had assumed the status of workers' representative without being trade union leaders. The Government states that the legally established organisations have moreover publicly denied their alleged affiliation to the CNS.
.The Government explains that the sole purpose of the proceedings which were instituted against the leaders of this organisation was therefore to protect the trade union activity and freedom of legally established organisations. It also points out that the legitimately elected trade union leaders of legally existing organisations have the right to present petitions. The President of the Republic frequently meets with such leaders without such contacts leading to court proceedings against the trade unionists.
.The judicial authorities were therefore requested to examine whether the action of the CNS leaders constituted an offence or not. An examining magistrate was appointed and found grounds for a charge against the CNS leaders of illegally assuming the representation of workers. The defence requested the magistrate and subsequently the Appeals Court and the Supreme Court to annul the indictment and to release the persons concerned on bail. These two requests were refused. Subsequently, during the trial, bail was granted to the accused with the exception of Messrs. Guzmn and Bustos since under the Penal Code, persons who have been previously given suspended sentences of imprisonment are not entitled to bail. The Government points out however, that the persons concerned may request their temporary release as many times as they wish.
.As regards the allegations concerning the expulsion of four lawyers from the country, the Government points out that these persons - whose names it gives - were not the defence counsel of the CNS leaders, but were militant members of suspended political parties. Three of them had exercised ministerial functions in previous governments. One is in Venezuela, one in Spain and two in Mexico.
.In conclusion, the Government states that it has provided this information as a demonstration of its desire to cooperate with the ILO, but that it does not accept that it should be judged on the basis of complaints which are designed to complicate and prolong indefinitely the Chilean case before the ILO.
.The Committee notes that technical adjustments have been made to the trade union legislation. However, these amendments are not such as to warrant any modification of the comments made in its previous report. It therefore requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of any subsequent developments in this matter.
.The Committee also notes that inquiries are continuing into the disappearance of trade unionists. It would like to be kept informed of the results of the judicial inquiries now under way.
.As regards the matters involving the leaders the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, the Committee notes that the leaders in question have been prosecuted for having acted as representatives of the workers without having the legal capacity to do so, since they are the leaders of a de facto organisation which does not enjoy legal personality. The Committee must, however, point out that the origin of the present case is certainly one which concerns freedom of association because the proceedings were instituted after a register of demands of a clearly social and occupational nature had been presented by the leaders concerned. Furthermore, this register had been drawn up in accordance with a decision taken at a meeting which was attended by",2,1975,Chile
297,"a large number of federations or Confederations which represent workers from different sectors of activity and of which the leaders of the CNS are, for the most part, also leaders.
.If it is true that the CNS does not possess legal personality - in that it appears that this organisation never requested it - the Committee must however recall that, when it examined the new trade union legislation, it had pointed out that a certain number of provisions relating to federations and Confederations were incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, in particular as regards the setting up of these organisations. The Committee is of the opinion that these restrictions imposed on the creation and activities of Confederations might be able to explain, at least to a certain extent, why the CNS has apparently not requested legal personality. In addition, the Committee notes that a number of organisations which take part in the activities of the CNS do have legal personality. The Committee also recalls that the CNS-represents - as the ILO mission which was sent to Chile in December  was able to note - a body which co-ordinates different workers' organisations belonging to various sectors of activity.
.As regards the allegations that the Government refused to meet with the CNS leaders, the Committee must stress the importance, for the maintenance of a country's social harmony, of regular consultations with employers' and workers' representatives; as regards the trade union sphere such contacts should embrace the whole spectrum of trade union activity, irrespective of the philosophical or political beliefs of its leaders.
.The Committee notes that only the two trade unionists holding the principal executive function at the CNS, namely Manuel Bustos, chairman and Alamiro Guzmn, secretary-general, are still being detained at the present time. It points out that the proceedings taken against these two persons are of a particularly serious nature since the accused had already been found guilty of having represented workers without having the legal capacity to do so in an earlier trial and that their sentence could not this time be suspended. The Committee understands that the judicial proceedings in this matter are following their course. It therefore requests the Government to provide information on the results of these legal proceedings.
.As regards the other allegations which have been made by the complainants since the last examination of the case (arrest of two persons in March  and expulsion of four lawyers), the Committee takes note of the denial by the Government of the complainants' statements concerning the anti-trade union nature of the alleged facts.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not provided information on the allegations made by the WFTU concerning the dismissal of workers in the Panal Textile Undertaking.
.The last time the Committee examined this case was at its May  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have sent the ILO the following communications: the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (communications dated  May,  and  June,  July and  November  and  January ); the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) (communications dated  and  June ); the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) (a communication dated  June ); the International Federation of Teachers' Unions (IFTU) (a communication of  June ); the Miners' Trade Unions International (UISM) (communications dated  June  and  January ); the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) (communications dated  October and  and  November  and  and  January and  February ); the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees (a communication dated  November ); the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) (a communication dated  January ); and the ""Group of Ten"" ( February ).
.For its part, the Government forwarded observations in communications dated  October , the month of November  and  and  February .
.Also, when the Governing Body discussed the nd Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association in May , the Workers' group requested that a high-level mission be sent to Chile to examine the trade union situation. Following contacts and correspondence exchanged with the Government, the Director-General appointed Mr. Nicolas Valticos, Assistant Director-General, Adviser for International Labour Standards, Mr. Manuel Araoz, Chief of the Freedom of Association Branch, and Mr. Bernard Gernigon, official in the same branch, to carry out that mission, which took place from  to  December .
.Before the mission left for Santiago, contacts had been made with the Permanent Delegation of Chile in Geneva to arrange for it to meet various government authorities, in particular the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice. On its arrival in Santiago the mission was handed a work programme where interviews with the Ministers of Labour and Justice, among others, were scheduled. In the end, the Minister of Labour, Mr. Jose Piera, sent his apologies for being unable to receive the members of the mission and was represented by Mr. L.A. Camus, Undersecretary of State for Labour. The mission also met Messrs. Enrique Montero, Under-Secretary of State for the Interior; Lautaro Prez Ruiz, Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Justice; Ramn Surez, Director of Labour; Jaime Lagos, Director of Bilateral Policy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Leonel Beraud, President of the Court of Appeal of Santiago.
.The mission also had talks with the President of the Confederation of Manufacturing and Commerce at the headquarters of this central employers' organisation, and with officials of affiliated organisations, namely the National Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Company, the Association of Banks and Financial Institutions, the National Agricultural Society, the Chilean Chamber of Building and the Industrial Development Association.
.As concerns workers' organisations, the mission met the leaders of many legally recognised or de facto organisations belonging to all trade union tendencies and covering many branches of activity: a group of trade unionists who were supporters of leaders in the copper, leather and footwear, banking, coal mining, saltpetre, maritime and electricity sectors; the Chilean Confederation of Employees in the Private Sector (CEPCH); the ""Group of Ten"", which included representatives of workers in the civil service, agriculture, copper mining, postal services, the maritime sector, the iron and steel industry, metalworking, plastics, the railways and social security; the National Trade Union Confederation of Agricultural Workers; Peasant Workers' Unity (an organisation which had been dissolved in October ); the National Confederation of copper workers; the ""National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body"", which included in particular representatives of workers in agriculture, metalworking, building, mining, coal mining and textiles; the Workers' Unitary Front, whose delegation comprised leaders from the textile, ports, teaching, municipal employees', plastics and public works sectors; the Confederation of Unions of Workers in Metalworking, Mining and Assimilated Branches. Over  trade union leaders took part in some of these meetings, most of which were held on trade union premises. The mission also spoke to representatives of the Association of Relatives of Persons Who Are under Arrest or Who Have Disappeared. It also had private talks with persons knowledgeable in social affairs.
.In addition to these meetings the mission visited the Operations Centre of the El Teniente Copper Mines, where it had talks with the management of the undertaking and the trade unions on working conditions and industrial relations and on certain allegations pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.All the information collected on the spot was the subject of a detailed mission report, which the Committee fully took into account when examining the allegations before it.
.On  June  the Government promulgated several legislative decrees on trade union rights and the right to collective bargaining, in particular Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  known as the ""Labour Plan"". Subsequently, certain technical amendments were made to these texts, particularly in November  and May . At its November  and May  Sessions, the Committee noted that this legislation was an important step forward and made a number of comments on these texts, especially on the following points: formation of trade unions, procedure for acquiring legal personality, trade union by-laws, elections of trade union leaders, inspection of trade union accounts, prohibition to intervene in partisan political activities, formation of federations and Confederations, trade union rights of public officials, scope and level of collective bargaining, and the right to strike.
.The mission's report indicates that the new legislation is an improvement over the previous situation where, under Legislative Decree No.  adopted in December  immediately after the change of regime, the right to hold trade union elections, the right of collective bargaining and the right to strike had been suspended and the right to hold meetings seriously restricted. Both the Government representatives and the employers' representatives stressed the advance which this legislation represented from the standpoint of freedom of association. It was pointed out that a trade union organisation may acquire legal personality merely",-1,1975,Chile
298,"by depositing its by-laws, that trade unions can be dissolved only by court order, that there is no governmental control over trade union activities, that the election of new trade union leaders and the approval of trade union by-laws are made by secret ballot, and that workers have the possibility of choosing between organisations of different tendencies.
.The mission found, however, that the legislation was severely criticised at times, even in trade union circles which do not pursue a policy of systematic opposition to the Government. The workers' representatives - as, to a certain degree, the employers' representatives - stressed in particular that they had not been consulted about the trade union legislation or the labour policy.
.In the Committee's opinion, such an absence of dialogue - which the mission found far more marked than in  during the visit of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission - can only prejudice the interests of workers, the development of labour relations and social progress in general. The Committee thinks it useful here to refer to the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), Paragraph  of which provides that measures should be taken to promote effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations without discrimination of any kind against these organisations. In accordance with Paragraph  of the Recommendation, such consultation should aim at ensuring that the public authorities seek the views, advice and assistance of these organisations, particularly in the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests.
.The missions report reveals that the failure to consult the trade union organisations is only one aspect of the diminished role played by the national federations and Confederations in labour relations. Major obstacles are placed in the way of their establishment (requirement of at least  organisations for constituting a Confederation) or their survival (requirement for individual trade unions to renew their membership of federations every two years). Lastly and above all, under the new legislation federations and Confederations do not have the right either to bargain collectively or to call work stoppages. The trade union movement is thus deprived, at its highest level, of the rights essential for the protection of the workers' interests. Consequently, the trade unions engaged in collective bargaining - i.e. the plant unions - often find themselves at a disadvantage in negotiating with the management, especially as the right to strike is greatly limited by certain legislative provisions under which enterprises may recruit staff during the strike, as there is voluntary dismissal of workers if they do not recommence work within a period of  days, and because an excessive number of enterprises are deemed to be essential enterprises for which work stoppages are prohibited.
.The report also refers to other obstacles to the free operation of the trade unions which seriously limit their possibilities of effective action, such as the control exercised by the Directorate of Labour over trade union management and the requirement for a sworn official to be present at voting during trade union meetings.
.A large body of workers is not covered by some of the safeguards granted by the legislation. By reason of the legal impossibility of forming plant unions having less than  members, workers in small enterprises, for example, are not in a position to form trade unions for their specific activities and are therefore unable to join organisations having the right of collective bargaining. Lastly, workers in the public sector and in the maritime sector do not come within the scope of the trade union legislation. Specific regulations for these categories of workers are now under study.
.From a perusal of the missions report, the Committee has noted that the legislative provisions criticised most severely and most frequently by the trade union organisations are precisely those on which it had commented in November  when analysing the ""Labour Plan"". The Committee therefore considers that it would be necessary to amend the trade union legislation with a view to more effective application of the principles of freedom of association and hence of greater social justice.
.In these circumstances, it is regrettable that in the absence of the Minister of Labour, the findings arrived at by the mission could not be the subject of a true exchange of views with the government authorities and that they were unable to inform the mission whether such amendments or a change in government policy in the field of trade union rights could be contemplated in future. The Committee nevertheless trusts that the necessary legislative amendments will be introduced shortly in the light of the recommendations made by it. It would also like to be kept informed of any subsequent developments in this connection.
.Allegations were previously made regarding the dissolution by the Government of seven trade union organisations in October . According to the Government, the conduct of the dissolved organisations showed that their means of action and objectives coincided with the principles and aims of Marxist doctrine. The organisations in question had brought appeals to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which dismissed them.
.In a document of the external Committee of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, attached to the communications of the WFTU and the ICFTU, it was also mentioned that the Supreme Court had dissolved the trade union of the Santiago Union club on the ground that a trade union cannot exist in a non-profit making institution.
.More recent allegations related to the action taken by the authorities against the Unitary Workers' Front (FUT).
.During the mission talks were held with the leaders of several of the federations and Confederations dissolved in October. . Although these organisations continue to have a de facto existence, their leaders mentioned the great difficulties which they encounter in trying to keep them in operation.
.For its part, the Government stated in its communication of November  that the dissolution of the organisations in question was decided by law and not by administrative procedure. None of those organisations was engaged in labour activities. On the contrary, according to the Government, their activities were purely political and were carried on only by a few leaders. The government authorities also told the mission that the measures to dissolve those organisations were taken before the ""Labour Plan"" was promulgated and that dissolution of trade union organisations under the new legislation can be made only by judicial procedure. They also stressed that workers, including those who belonged to the dissolved trade unions, are entitled to form the organisations they wish, provided the law is observed.
.Regarding the dissolution of the trade union of the Santiago Union Club, the Government explained in its communication of November  that the employer had argued before the courts that the trade union established in , when the former Labour Code was still in force, had no legal existence. Under that Code, industrial trade unions could not be formed in non-profit making establishments. The Directorate of Labour, like the workers themselves, maintained on the contrary that the union had a legal existence. In the end, the court ruled in favour of the complainant and dissolved the organisation in February . The Government pointed out, however, that as of  October  no administrative action had yet been taken to strike the organisation from the trade union register and that the workers concerned could at all events form another trade union or transform the existing one in accordance - with the new legislation.
.The case for the Unitary Workers' Front was dismissed by the judge and confirmed by the Santiago Court of Appeal in October .
.The Committee takes note of the explanations supplied by the Government concerning the dissolution of seven federations and Confederations in October . It wishes to point out in this connection that dissolution of trade unions by the Executive in the exercise of legislative powers does not provide safeguards, any more than dissolution by administrative procedure for the rights of the defence. These rights can be guaranteed only by a normal judiciary procedure, which the Committee regards as indispensable. The Committee notes that under the new trade union legislation, workers' organisations can only be dissolved by judicial means. Concerning the liquidation of the funds and assets of the dissolved organisations, the Committee has been guided in cases of this kind by the criterion that, when an organisation is dissolved, its assets should eventually be distributed among its former members or handed over to the organisation that succeeds it. The Committee has also pointed out that the successor organisation should be understood to mean an organisation or organisations pursuing the aims for which the dissolved unions were established, and pursuing them in the same spirit.
.As regards the trade union of the Union Club, the Committee notes that it was dissolved by judiciary proceedings on the basis of the former provisions of the Labour Code and that the workers concerned may now form an organisation in accordance with the new legislation.
.Various complaints, which were either mentioned in the Committee's nd Report or received since then, referred to",2,1975,Chile
299,"dismissals of trade unionists in a number of undertakings, especially Hilanderia Andina SA, CTI Fensa Mademsa, the Copper Company of Chile (El Teniente division and Chuquicamata centre), the Latacen company, the Jorge Rivet Moulin company and the Chilean and North American Cultural Institute. Other communications recently received state that there have been dismissals of leaders of the public sector workers' organisations, in particular, the National Revenue Employees' Association (ANEF), the Association of Social Security Auxiliaries and trade unionists from the taxation department.
.From the information supplied by the Government in its communication of November  or in the documents handed to the mission, it appears that the dismissals at Hilandera Andina SA, CTI Fensa Mademsa and the Chilean and North American Cultural Institute were due to economic or financial reasons. In the last case, the workers filed an appeal with the courts.
.Regarding the dismissals at the Copper Company of Chile (El Teniente division), the Government stated that, following the appeal made by the workers, the labour court of Rancagua ordered the company to reinstate the dismissed workers or pay them compensation. The company opted for the second course. The labour court also gave a ruling in favour of the trade union leaders dismissed at the Chuquicamata centre and ordered their reinstatement. The company has complied with the court's decision and paid these leaders compensation corresponding to the period of dismissal. Three of the workers dismissed from the company Jorge Rivet Moulin filed an appeal with the courts which resulted in the payment of compensation. Concerning the dismissals of trade union leaders from the Latacen company, the Directorate of Labour informed the mission that the workers concerned, after an attempt at conciliation by the Labour Inspectorate had failed, filed an appeal with the labour court, which is now being examined.
.The mission had an opportunity to meet the trade union leaders of the National Revenue Employees' Association (ANEF) who had been dismissed. According to the trade unionists and, in particular, the President of ANEF, who had been removed from his functions within the National Directorate of industry and commerce, these measures were taken because of the trade union activities of the workers concerned. The Minister for Economic Affairs, on the other hand, asserted in a statement to the press that the dismissals were due to a reorganisation of the service in question.
.The Committee notes that some of the dismissals of trade unionists were due to economic or financial reasons. While the Committee is not competent to judge the advisability or not of dismissals of this nature, in the present instance it observes that there were court proceedings in several cases which resulted in compensation paid to the workers dismissed and even, in one case, to their reinstatement. The Committee therefore considers it appropriate to recall the importance of effective protection against dismissals on account of trade union activities and to point out that in cases of dismissals for economic reasons, measures discriminating against trade unions taken under this pretext should not be authorised.
.Regarding the dismissals of ANEF leaders, the Committee points out that the lack of legal recognition of the trade union rights of government employees, and the resulting lack of protection for trade union militants, can only encourage the adoption of measures prejudicial to the leaders of de facto organisations existing in this sector.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to permit the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists.
.At various stages in examining this case, the Committee has received allegations relating to the arrest and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In March , the Government stated that the Santiago Court of Appeal had appointed one of its judges to hear the cases concerning persons presumed to have disappeared while on trial before tribunals in its jurisdiction. These cases concerned  of the persons mentioned in the complaints.
.More recently, complaints were lodged concerning action taken against various trade union leaders, the arrest of leaders of the National Federation of Metallurgical Unions (FENSIMET) and the placing under forced residence of persons arrested on May Day  and agricultural trade union leaders at Curic. Other allegations related to the arrest of Mr. Pedro Enriquez, former secretary for Youth of the CUT, on  November , and of Mr. Alvarez Seplveda, a metalworkers' leader, on  November .
.Lastly, communications from several complainant organisations (ICFTU, WFTU, CPUSTAL, UISM) dated January  have reported the arrest of Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzman, Chairman and Secretary-General of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee, respectively, whom the members of the mission had met while in Chile. They were arrested allegedly for having acted as representatives of an unregistered organisation.
.As regards the missing persons, the President of the Santiago Court of Appeal told the mission that the inquiry was going ahead and that the judge dealing with the case had not yet been able to take a final decision. In this connection, the mission was told that the amnesty law adopted by the Government in April  prevented action being taken against security officers who may have been involved in the disappearances and consequently the cases before the courts could not be concluded.
.According to the government authorities, the persons placed under house arrest following the celebration of May Day were activists who were not trade union leaders and who had created disturbances and provoked violence in the streets. Likewise, there were no trade union leaders among the seven persons living at Curic who had been placed under house arrest for disturbance of the peace. Only one of them had been engaged in trade union activities in .
.As regards the pending trials on which the Committee and Governing Body had requested information in May , the Government stated that the cases against Mr. Bobadilla, President of the National Federation of Textile Workers, and Mr. Guzman, President of the National Industrial Mining Federation, were dismissed and the dismissals confirmed by the Santiago Court of Appeal. Proceedings had been brought against these leaders for having acted as representatives of organisations without legal personality. The Government also stated that these trade union leaders had enjoyed complete freedom throughout the trial. Regarding Juan Jara, President of the Taxi Drivers' Trade Union, who had been accused, according to the complainants, of having organised a May Day demonstration, the Government stated that the Santiago Court of Appeal had suspended the prison sentence which was warranted by the elements contained in the dossier. Proceedings have now been brought against two other persons whom the complainants said had been arrested, Victor Muoz and Gustavo Poblete, the first for being in possession of false identity papers and the second for subversive activities. According to the Government, these two persons are not trade union leaders. Regarding the five leaders of the National Federation of Metallurgical unions whom the complainants alleged had been detained for three days and prosecuted, the Government stated that the persons in question were the subject of a complaint by the Ministry of the interior for having acted as representatives of other persons without the authorisation to do so. They were acquitted by the court of first instance, but given a suspended prison sentence by the Court of Appeal.
.As regards Mr. Pedro Enriquez, the Ministry of the Interior told the mission that this person had been arrested for engaging in activities against the security of the State, that the inquiry had established that he had used false identity papers, and that he had been placed at the disposal of the criminal judge in Santiago. Lastly, the mission was unable to obtain any information before leaving Chile concerning the arrest of Mr. Alvarez Seplveda. Since then, the Government has stated that the person referred to in the allegations, whose real name is Alvaro Seplveda, was released three days after his arrest. The Court of Appeal of Santiago, which had before it an appeal of habeas corpus in this connection, has been informed of the release of this person.
.As regards Mr. Alamiro Guzman and Manuel Bustos, the Government stated in its communication of  February  that the. Minister of the Interior, by virtue of the powers accorded to him under Legislative Decree No.  of , appealed to the Court of Appeal of Santiago against these persons for having acted as representatives of workers without the authorisation to do so through a legally non-existing body called ""the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body"". The investigating magistrate did not uphold the charges against these persons who were released on bail. The case is continuing before an ordinary civil judicial body which is independent of the executive authorities.
.The Committee notes, first of all, that no new elements have been produced in the cases pending before the courts concerning the missing trade unionists or former trade unionists. Furthermore, according to the information obtained by the mission from various sources, these cases could not be concluded because the amnesty law adopted by the Government in  did not allow proceedings to be brought against the security officers who",2,1975,Chile
300,"might be involved in the disappearances. In these conditions, the Committee must keenly regret that the inquiries undertaken by the judicial bodies were not able to clarify the circumstances of these disappearances. It would like to be kept informed of any subsequent developments in the procedures under way.
.The Committee takes note of the observations supplied by the Government on the placing under house arrest, detention and sentencing of the persons mentioned by the complainants. It notes that the reply conflicts with the allegations since the complainants claim that these various measures are related to the trade union activities of the persons concerned whereas the Government states that they are the consequence of breaking the law, disturbing the peace or engaging in subversive activities. The Committee however must observe that in most of the cases the Government has not supplied, in support of its statements, detailed information about the precise facts for which the persons mentioned by the complainants are blamed.
.Regarding the placing of persons under house arrest, the Committee notes that a number of such measures were taken as a result of a demonstration organised on May Day, which is traditionally a day of trade union action. It also observes that these procedures, to which the Government resorted on several occasions, are of an administrative nature, i.e. without any safeguard for the rights of the defence.
.In addition, the Committee notes that court proceedings have been brought against various leaders of national federations, at the instigation of the Ministry of the Interior, for having acted as representatives of other persons without the authorisation to do so or as representatives of unregistered organisations while some have been acquitted, others have on the contrary been given suspended prison sentences. In the Committee's view, such action can only be detrimental to the return to normal trade union life. Furthermore, the Committee cannot help but see a link between these cases and the difficulties imposed by the legislation for establishing and maintaining in existence federations and Confederations.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that Mr. Alvaro Seplveda was released three days after his arrest and that the cases concerning Mr. Guzmn and Mr. Bustos, who are now released on bail, are continuing before the courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report, in particular the following conclusions;The Committee takes note of the information collected by the ILO mission which visited Chile in December .As regards the trade union legislation, the Committee regrets that in the absence of the Minister of Labour, the findings arrived at by the mission could not be the subject of a true exchange of views with the government authorities and that they were unable to indicate whether amendments or a change in government policy on trade union matters could be contemplated. It nevertheless trusts that the necessary legislative amendments will be introduced shortly with a view to more effective application of the principles of freedom of association and hence greater social justice. With this in mind, the Committee wishes to underline the interest which organisations of employers and workers have in consultation during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any subsequent developments concerning the trade union legislation.The Committee must also recall that application of a normal judicial procedure is essential in cases where trade union organisations are dissolved, a procedure which was not observed in the case of seven federations and Confederations dissolved in . The Committee notes that the new trade union legislation provides that workers' organisations can only be dissolved by judicial means and that this procedure was followed in the case of the trade union of the Santiago Union Club.Regarding the dismissals of trade unionists, the Committee wishes to stress the importance of effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination. As regards more specifically the dismissals in the public sector, the Committee considers that the lack of legal recognition of the trade union rights of government employees can only encourage the adoption of measures prejudicial to the leaders of de facto organisations existing in this sector. Consequently, it requests the Government to take measures to permit the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists.Concerning the disappearance and arrest of trade unionists, the Committee must observe that no new elements have been produced in the cases concerning missing trade unionists or former trade unionists. The Committee keenly regrets that the inquiries undertaken by the judicial bodies have not been able to clarify the circumstances of these disappearances. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any subsequent development in the procedures under way.As regards the placing of persons under house arrest, the Committee must point out that these measures, some of which were taken as a result of May Day celebrations, are of an administrative nature and consequently the rights of the defence are not safeguarded.The Committee also considers that the proceedings brought by the Ministry of the Interior against the leaders of national federations can only be detrimental to a return to normal trade union life.It requests the Government to supply information on the results of the court cases instituted against Mr. Guzmn and Mr. Bustos.
.The last time the Committee examined this case was at its November  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Shortly before and since this last examination of this case, the Committee received new communications from the following complainant organisations: the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAN) ( October ), the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers (UISTAFP) ( November  and  April ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) ( December ,  and  April ), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers ( December  and  February ), the Permanent Congress of Trade Union. Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) ( December  and  April ), the Miners' Trade Unions -international (WFTU) ( December ), the International Federation of Teachers' Unions (IFTU) ( December ), the Trade Unions International of Transport Workers (UIST) ( December ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( December ,  and  January,  and  March, ,  and  April and  and  May ), the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees ( April ), World Confederation of Labour ( and  May ). The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February,  April, and ,  and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (no. ).
.On  June  the Government published several legislative decrees concerning trade union rights and the right to collective bargaining, in particular Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  of which the Committee took note at its November  Session. At that time, the Committee made comments on these texts, particularly on the following points: formation of trade unions, acquisition of legal personality, trade union by-laws, conditions of eligibility of leaders, supervision of trade union funds, prohibition of intervention in partisan political activities, setting up of federations and Confederations, trade union rights of public officials, field of application and level of collective bargaining, and the right to strike.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, decided:(i) to note with satisfaction the abrogation of Legislative decree No.  which had been adopted in. December  and which imposed serious restrictions on trade union activities;(ii) to note that the promulgation of the legislative decrees on trade union organisations and collective bargaining constituted an important first step in the application of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee in relation to certain provisions of this legislation which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining with a view to introducing the necessary amendments;(iv) to express the hope that the legislation will be thus applied in a spirit conforming to the principles of freedom of association and with respect for civil rights, the importance of which had been stressed by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(v) to request the Government to forward information on the implementation of the recommendations mentioned in subparagraph (iii) above and to continue to supply information on the practical application of the legislative decrees.
.It its communication dated  February , the Government states that certain technical amendments have been made to the legislation on trade union organisations and collective bargaining by Legislative Decree No. , published in the Official Journal on  November . The amendments to Legislative Decree No.  concerning collective bargaining include the introduction of details on matters to be governed by collective agreements, the grant of the right to negotiate to trade union management, the elimination of the necessity of having legal personality to administer welfare schemes. In addition, for one",1,1975,Chile
301,"year after the entry into force of the Legislative Decree, all previously existing trade unions are entitled to bargain collectively even if the number of their members or the percentage of workers they represent in the undertaking is less than that required by the law. The determination of the minimum percentage of workers necessary for collective bargaining is also amended. This percentage is now fixed in relation to the total number of workers who are the subject of the negotiations, and no longer with regard to the total number of wage earners in the undertaking.
.In both its communications of  February and  April , the Government supplies various statistical information concerning concluded collective agreements, strikes that have been called and trade union organisations that have been set up. In the light of this information, it therefore appears that between.  August  and  March , workers have presented , draft collective agreements and , new agreements have been signed. From  October  to  March ,  strikes concerning more than , workers and of an average length of . days have been recorded. The only recourse to compulsory arbitration occurred at the National Electricity undertaking. During the last  months, more than  trade unions, and one Confederation covering  trade unions and  federations, have been set up.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that Legislative Decree No.  introducing some amendments to the labour legislation was adopted on  May . It mainly deals with technical changes to the Act on trade union organisations. In particular the Government mentions in this regard the provisions on special contributions which can be collected under the check-off system, the facilities granted to trade union leaders, the extension of trade union rights in agriculture, staff delegates, collective bargaining and employer organisations.
.The Government also states that regarding the setting up and supervision of trade unions, measures have been adopted with a view to limiting the role previously given to administrative bodies of the State. In fact, from now on there is a possibility of appeal before the courts as regards faults in the establishment of trade unions as found by the Labour Inspectorate. Moreover, the powers of the Labour Direction with regard to supervision have been limited. The Labour Direction no longer has the possibility to freeze current accounts, and in the case of irregularities constituting crimes, it must bring a complaint before the courts.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government regarding the application of the new legislation as well as the amendments made to the Legislative Decrees promulgated in June . In particular, it notes with interest that certain amendments introduce the possibility of judicial appeal against administrative decisions, as regards the establishment of trade unions. However, the Committee must note with regret that most of the provisions concerning the points recalled in paragraph  above regarding which it made comments when it examined the legislation, have not yet been amended. It expresses the firm hope that the necessary amendments will be introduced in the near future in light of the principles of freedom of association and the recommendations made by the Committee. Moreover, the Committee would like to ask the Government to keep it informed of any development in the matter.
.At its previous sessions, the Committee examined the allegations concerning the dismissal on  March  of Daniel Lillo, President of the National Association of Customs Employees of Valparaiso. This measure was taken by the Regional Governor (intendente) of the Valparaiso region in accordance with Legislative Decree No.  of . This legislative decree empowers intendentes and governors to demand the resignation of members of the executive Committees of certain types of associations, in particular of workers' organisations in the public sector, on the ground of serious impediments to the functioning of that organisation, and to appoint replacements. If the person concerned does not resign within the stated time limit, the intendente or governor issues a decree removing the person concerned from his position as a leader of the organisation. In the present case, the Government claims that Mr. Lillo had given to the press a false account of a meeting which he had not attended. The Government stated later that Mr. Lillo had been temporarily suspended from his employment.
.At its November  Session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, had drawn the Government's attention to certain principles concerning the importance of protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and had asked it to indicate whether Legislative Decree No.  had been repealed as far as workers' organisations in the public sector were concerned.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that various government bodies are presently studying the reform of the law on public officers. The new legislation which will establish a definitive system of association of state employees will replace the interim standards contained in Legislative Decree No. . The Government adds that its philosophy is against interference by the authorities in the associations, and aims at reaffirming their liberty and autonomy.
.It appears from the information supplied by the Government that Legislative Decree No. , in pursuance of which Daniel Lillo was removed from office, is still in force. Consequently, the Committee must recall that the provisions of this Legislative Decree allowing removal of leaders from associations of public sector workers by administrative authorities are not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It must urge that these provisions be repealed. In addition, the Committee hopes that the legislation concerning organisations of workers in the public sector which is presently under study will repeal the provisions in, question, and, morn generally, that it will accord trade union rights to public officers.
.In its communication of  January , the ICFTU refers to violations of trace union rights said to have been committed by the Chilean authorities against four workers of the Copper Company of Chile (CODELCO), a division of El Teniente. The ICFTU appended to its letter a communication from the National Group for Defence of Trade Union Rights.
.It is stated in this communication that four workers of the CODELCO undertaking, a division of El Teniente, were elected members of the Financial Control Commission of the industrial union of Rancagua. This election took place following a vote of censure against the former commission which was guilty, along with the present trade union leadership, of embezzlement of trade union funds.
.The communication states that the new commission has successfully carried out a detailed study which has permitted the discovery of illegal manoeuvres by the trade union leadership with the agreement, the collusion or the indifference of state bodies.;
.The communication also states that the present trade union leadership has obstructed the activities of the Financial Control Commission although the former has the sole responsibility for the illegal and unconstitutional management of these funds. The complicity of state officials is explained, according to the communication, by political reasons. It is added that the trade union leaders who are responsible for this situation are in favour of the Government, which protects them. In spite of pressure and threats the members of the Control Commission continued their investigations.
.This provoked reactions from the Government and from the public undertaking CODELCO, which on  October  dismissed the four members of the Commission. The undertaking based these measures on section  of Act No. , which concerns dismissals for reasons connected with the functioning of the undertaking, the establishment or the service. The directorate of the undertaking replied to requests for explanations that there had been ""orders from above"". It is stated in the communication that in this manner, the Government of Chile, acting both as public authority and as employer, intervened to the prejudice of members of the union, and interfered in purely trade union questions.
.The documentation sent by the WFTU and the ICFTU on  and  April  also mentions measures of dismissal taken against leaders of various trade union organisations: the Industrial Trade Union of Copper Mines in Chuquicamata, the Post and Telegraph Association of Concepcin and the Textile Workers' Union ""Andina"". Moreover,  workers of the CTI undertaking are said to have been dismissed as a reprisal following a -day legal strike held in December .
.In its communication of  April , the Government refers to the dismissal of workers who were said to be elected members of the Financial Control commission of the industrial union of Rancagua (CODELCO), a division of El Teniente. The Government explains that these persons put forward their nomination to this commission during a meeting of the union held on  March . However, in the minutes of the meeting there is no trace of their election. Nevertheless they assumed these functions in actual fact, and requested from the works management control of the accounts of the union. In the end, after a complaint against the union, the works management had to put the case before the competent criminal judge. In addition, the workers concerned",-1,1975,Chile
302,"have brought the question of dismissal before the tribunals, which have not yet handed down their judgement.
.Generally, the Committee considers it desirable to recall at the present time, due to the large number of allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists, the importance which it attaches to effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination. It notes that the dismissals which took place at CODELCO, a division of El Teniente, are subject to judicial proceedings, and it would accordingly like to be kept informed of the outcome. The Committee would also like to have the Government's observations on the new allegations of dismissals mentioned above.
.It various stages in the examination of the case, the Committee has examined allegations concerning the detention and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists in a report examined by the Committee in November , the Government gave information concerning  out of  persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report. In March , the Government pointed out that the Santiago Court of Appeal had delegated one of its judges to discharge the special mission of considering the cases of those persons presumed to have disappeared while on trial before one of the tribunals of the Santiago Court of Appeal district. These cases concerned  of the persons mentioned in the complaints.
.In a communication of October , the ICFTU stated that  corpses bearing signs of torture had been discovered near the Yumbel cemetery. According to statements of the inhabitants of this area, the bodies had been buried at the end of October . A large deployment of military forces and police had been seen at the time in the area. The ICFTU stated that two of the bodies had been identified as trade union leaders from the paper industry at Laja.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, asked the Government to continue to supply information on the outcome of the proceedings under way and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report, and to provide its observations on the ICFTU's new allegations.
.In various communications several complainant organisations refer to repression against seven leaders of trade union federations whose indictment the Government had requested through the ministry of the Interior. These leaders had, in the names of their organisations, stated in writing that the competent authorities should return to their relatives the bodies of the persons found at Lomqun.
.In its communication of  November  the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation workers gives details of this affair. It explains that the bodies of  peasants who were members of the Confederation ""Ranquil"" had been found last year in an abandoned lime-kiln, at Lomqun, close to Santiago. According to the complainant organisation, the eight policemen guilty of these murders had benefited from the amnesty law and are at liberty. It adds that the bodies have been buried in a common grave instead of being returned to their relatives. The seven trade union leaders had then addressed a letter to the Minister of the Interior concerning this case. The complainant organisation states that the Ministry of the Interior's request for indictment of these persons was rejected by the investigating judge. The UISTAFP adds that on  September  the police arrested  persons accused of disturbing public order, following a mass celebrated in the Santiago cathedral in memory of the  assassinated peasants.
.The Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges in its letter of  February  that one of the seven arrested leaders, Fernando Bobadilla, President of the National Federation of Textile and Clothing Workers, was sentenced on  January  to  days' imprisonment.
.In its communication of  January , the ICFTU mentions the arrest of Victor Muoz, a leader of the trade union ""Textile Sumar"". This person is said to have been accused of ""extra-union activities"" contrary to the law.
.In its communications of  and  March , the ICFTU states that it has also been informed that the celebration of Women's International Day organised on  March  by the National Trade Union Co-ordination was violently put down by the authorities. According to the complainant organisation, the police made more than  arrests in Santiago and Valparaiso. Those arrested are said to be kept in secret not in the usual places of detention or have been placed under house arrest in areas known to be the least comfortable. The ICFTU supplies a list of  persons so dealt with by a decision of the Minister of the Interior made under Legislative Decree No. .
.The allegations made by the external Committee of the Sole Central of Chilean Workers in the document sent by the WFTU and the ICFTU also mentions the arrest of three workers of the Good Year company in Santiago during a peaceful demonstration organised when a dispute was going on in the undertaking.
.Numerous communications from complainant organisations concern the arrest of trade union leaders accused of organising demonstrations for May Day. The complainants give the following names: Humberto Vergara, Herman Navarro, Alfonso Hernandez, Carlos Ulloa, Carlos Morales (leader of the United Federation of Peasants and Workers) and Juan Jara (president of the Taxi Trade union).
.In this regard, the ICFTU explains in its letter of  April  that only government-organised celebrations for May Day had been authorised. The WCL alleges that police intervention during a demonstration organised by the Workers' Unitary Front on May Day caused four serious fire-arm woundings and the arrest of  workers. In addition, the ICFTU alleges that  workers were sentenced on  May last for having provoked disorder and for having incited violence by distributing pamphlets and by organising a demonstration on May Day in the north of the country. Lastly, the ICFTU in its communication of  May  refers to the arrest of Adolfo Poblete Caldern in the Talca region.
.In its reply of  April , the Government states that regarding the seven trade union leaders arrested following their inquiries regarding the discovery of the bodies at Lomqun, the Minister of the interior transmitted the case to the Santiago Court of Appeal so that it should decide whether those concerned had, in fact, committed a crime under the law. The Tribunal considered that there were sufficient reasons as regards two of them, Fernando Bobadilla and Alomiro Guzmn. The others were set free. On  January , the Public Prosecutor requested a prison sentence for the two men concerned for having acted as agents of other persons without possessing the legal personality to do so. The Government points out that the reasons behind the legal proceedings are not linked to trade union activities.
.Regarding Victor Manuel Muoz Espinoza, who was mentioned in an ICFTU communication, the Government states that he was arrested on  December  for having distributed subversive pamphlets in a public place and for having in his possession a false identity card. The investigating magistrate of the Court of Santiago considered that there were grounds to convict, and ordered his imprisonment. The defence lawyer did not request provisional release. Recently, the Public Prosecutor again requested a prison sentence. Regarding the ICFTU allegation, the Government states that Victor Manuel Muoz is not amongst the leaders of the  trade unions at the Sumar S.A. undertaking.
.Regarding the disturbances which took place during the celebrations for Women's international Day, the Government explains that about  persons demonstrated in a non-authorised public place and provoked disturbances, defying the police who were controlling the traffic and causing violations of public and private property. A total of  men and  women were arrested,  of whom were students,  workers,  mothers of families and  of no known occupation. All the women were set free after  minutes as were  other persons. Eight persons were placed under house arrest in the environs of Valparaiso with freedom of movement within the city.
.As for the events which took place on May Day, the Government points out that Carlos Morales, Alfonso Hernandez and Herman Navarro were arrested for having provoked disorder in a public place paralysing vehicular traffic. They were set free the same day. One of the persons mentioned by the complainants, namely Juan Jara, was brought before the Santiago court on charges of defamation and libel. He has been free on bail since  April, and, if he is convicted, he may be granted a conditional suspension of his sentence.
.As regards Adolfo Poblete Caldern, the Government states that this person was arrested on  May  and was immediately brought before the Talca courts. He is accused of having infringed the provisions of the Act on internal security of the State. He has not been held in secret and he has chosen a defence lawyer.
.The Committee notes with concern that, since it last examined this case in November , it has received numerous complaints regarding the arrest of",1,1975,Chile
303,"trade union leaders and militants. In its reply, the Government supplies information on seven of the leaders listed by the complainants, whose arrests, the Government claims, were not linked to trade union activities. It appears from the information that four of them were brought before the courts, and that the three others, who were arrested on May Day, were released that same day.
.In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that in numerous cases where the complainants allege that workers or trade union leaders have been arrested because of their trade union activities, and where the government's replies simply deny the allegations or claim that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for crimes under ordinary law, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information as precise as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegation. The Committee accordingly would like to receive detailed information on the results of the judicial proceedings undertaken against these four persons.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government on the demonstrations organised on Women's International Day. In particular, it notes that the persons arrested were released but that eight of them have been placed under house arrest. It appears that these measures were taken by the administrative authorities. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the right of all accused persons to enjoy the benefits of normal judicial procedures in these circumstances, the Committee considers that the persons arrested during a demonstration organised by a trade union, such as the one which is the subject of the allegations, should be released or, if they are accused of crimes, be judged by independent and impartial courts.
.As regards the arrests which took place on May Day, the Committee wishes to point out as it has done on several occasions and particularly in connection with this case that the right to organise public meetings and processions on May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights, provided the legal provisions on public order are observed.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet sent its observations of the allegations concerning the discovery of the bodies of two trade union leaders near Yumbel, the arrests which took place during a demonstration by the workers of the Good Year company, as well as on the incidents which took place on May Day and the sentencing of workers in the north of the country. The Committee finally notes that the Government has not supplied new information since May  concerning the inquiries undertaken as regards the disappearances of trade unionists or former trade unionists.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the new trade union legislation,(i) to note the information supplied by the Government regarding the application of the new legislation as well as the amendments made to the Legislative Decrees promulgated in June ;(ii) to note, in particular, with interest that certain amendments introduce the possibility of judicial appeal against administrative decisions, as regards the establishment of trade unions;(iii) to note with regret that most of the provisions which gave rise to comments by the Committee have not yet been amended;(iv) to express the firm hope that the necessary amendments will be introduced in the near future in light of the Principles of freedom of association and the recommendations made by the Committee in its th Report;(v) to ask the Government to keep the Committee informed of any development in the matter;(b) regarding the removal from office of Mr. Daniel Lillo,(i) to point out that the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  are not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and to urge that these provisions be repealed;(ii) to express the firm hope that the legislation relating to organisations of workers in the public sector which is presently under study will accord trade union rights to this category of worker;(c) as regards the dissolution of trade union organisations,(i) to point out that the procedure followed for the dissolution of seven organisations in October  is not in conformity with the principle according to which workers' organisations must not be dissolved by administrative authority and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in paragraph  above concerning the devolution of the assets of the dissolved organisations;(ii) to ask the Government to supply its observations on the dissolution of the trade union of the Santiago Union Club;(d) as regards the dismissal of trade unionists, to ask the Government to supply information on the results of the judicial proceedings brought by the dismissed workers of CODELCO, a division of El Teniente, as well as on the new allegations listed in paragraph  above;(e) regarding the allegations concerning civil liberties,(i) to express its concern over the number of allegations relating to the arrest of trade union leaders and militants;(ii) to ask the Government to supply its observations on the allegations mentioned in paragraphs  to  above, and, in particular, on any current judicial proceedings, especially concerning the cases of Mr. Fernando Bobadilla, Alomiro Guzmn, Victor Muoz and Juan Jara;(iii) also to ask the Government to supply its observations on the allegations made by the ICFTU in. October  (see paragraph  above) and information on the persons who the complainants allege to have disappeared or be detained and whose names appear in the Annex;(iv) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above concerning the arrests made during demonstrations organised on women's International Day and May Day;(f) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since then, the international Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has addressed, on  August , a communication to the ILO on the new trade union legislation promulgated by the Chilean Government. Furthermore, the Professional Trade Union of Seafarers of Chile and the Port Workers' Trade Union have presented a complaint by telegram on  September  and the ICFTU sent new allegations in a letter of  October . For its part the Government provided its observations in communications dated  and  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its report submitted to the Governing Body in May  the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, which had been entrusted with the examination of the case of Chile, had recommended to the Government the adoption without delay of new trade union legislation which, in order to be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association enshrined in the ILO Constitution and in order to enable the ratification, as the Government stated was envisaged, of the freedom of association Conventions, which contain very clear provisions on this question, should recognise the following principles:
.In the course of the various stages of the Government's work on the elaboration of a draft law on trade union organisations, the Committee has strongly urged the Government to promulgate without delay legislation which will guarantee the free exercise of trade union rights. On all these occasions, it has repeatedly recalled the principles set forth by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association in the perspective of the adoption of this legislation.
.At its session of May , the Committee took note of the Government's statements regarding the promulgation of new trade union legislation, which was expected for  June  at the latest. In addition, the Committee examined the guidelines of the new legislation, the text of which had been communicated by the Government. It noted with interest that, in the form in which they had bean communicated to the Committee, they appeared to have largely incorporated the principles endorsed by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association in its recommendations concerning the adoption of new trade union legislation. Nevertheless, the Committee reaffirmed that it could not pronounce itself on the question of the conformity or otherwise of the new legislation with the principles of freedom of association until it had all the necessary information at its disposal, and in particular, the full text of the new provisions. In this respect, it expressed its deep regret at the fact that the Government had not been able to supply the text of the draft law before it was finally promulgated. In these circumstances, the Committee could only urge the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the new legislation to be adopted by  June  should contain provisions conforming with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation",1,1975,Chile
304,"Commission and that the text should be speedily forwarded to the Committee so that it could make a pronouncement on its conformity or otherwise with the principles of freedom of association. Furthermore, the Committee considered it useful to reiterate the need for a full and speedy application of legislation conforming to the above-mentioned recommendations with a view to bringing to an end all the restrictions which have been in force in trade union matters for the last six years.
.The Government promulgated on  June  a number of legislative decrees concerning trade unions and collective bargaining, viz. Legislative Decree No.  which lays down Constitutional rules in the social field, Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  which lay down rules on trade union organisation and on professional associations respectively and Legislative Decree No.  on collective bargaining.
.In a communication dated  August , the ICFTU declares that Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  constitute grave violations of freedom of association. As far as Legislative Decree No.  is concerned, the ICFTU mentions more specifically the following provisions: articles  and  (minimum number of workers required to set up a trade union); article  (supervision of the legality of the Constitutions by the Labour Inspectorate); article  (majority necessary for the approval of the Constitutions); articles , , , , , ,  and  (rules governing elections); article  (termination of office of trade union leaders); Title VI (financial management of trade unions); article  (dissolution of trade unions); articles  to  (federations and Confederations).
.In its communication of  October , the Government: firstly gives a general picture of the substantive aspects of the legislation on trade union organisations, then it specifically replies to the ICFTU's allegations.
.The Government states that the series of standards, adopted under the ""Social Plan"" are aimed at enabling the free exercise of trade union rights by yet a greater number of workers. Trade union organisations now may be established and acquire legal personality through an ""automatic"" procedure which does not require the public authorities' authorisation. The Government notes that this is the first time that this procedure has been applied in Chile. It points out that shortly after the publication of the Legislative Decree many trade unions were established (a list of them is provided) as well as a saltpetre workers' Confederation. In this regard, in its communication of  October , it states that between  July and  September ,  new trade unions were formed covering , members.
.As a consequence of the new Legislative Decree, the Government must accord the same legal treatment to all workers. It notes that the previous Labour code discriminated between intellectual and manual workers; in fact the latter were obliged to affiliate in one sole trade union. The Government also points out that the Legislative Decree applies to all workers in the private sector and in state-owned undertakings and that it allows for a whole range of possible trade union structures (unions in undertakings, unions covering several undertakings or self-employed workers' unions).
.Under the provisions of the new Legislative Decree, continues the Government, organisations should enjoy internal democracy and union autonomy. The number of trade union leaders who should benefit from ""union protection"" has been increased and they are allowed time off to carry out their activities during working hours. The Government states that this did not exist in the previous Code. In order to increase trade union autonomy, important changes have been introduced. The Government states that organisations are no longer obliged to deposit their funds in the State Bank and unions of less than  members no longer need necessarily present an annual financial statement.
.The Government also points out that fines of up to , US dollars are provided for in cases where acts of anti-union discrimination are proven. To this end, the concept of unfair practices has been introduced. Moreover, the Government states that the system of trade union dissolution has undergone considerable amendment since the competence previously invested in the executive has been transferred to judicial tribunals.
.The Government considers that the new provisions evidence notable progress, both as regards the previous Labour Code of  and in light of the international standards and principles on the subject. Although the previous legislation may have openly violated the letter and spirit of Convention No. , Chile was never accused at that time of infringements of freedom of association. The Government draws attention to the fact that now this is no longer the case as it has corrected all the imperfections which previously existed.
.According to the Government it is not a question of an absolute analysis of the conformity of the ""Social Plan"" with the Conventions which it has not ratified. It is only advisable, so it states, to evaluate the new legislation by comparing it with recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.
.The Committee has taken cognizance of Legislative Decree No.  it notes with satisfaction that the new legislation abrogates Legislative Decree No.  which had been adopted in December , shortly after the change of regime, and which imposed serious restrictions on trade union activities. While welcoming this abrogation, which had been urged by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and by the Committee itself, the Committee must nevertheless make certain comments on some of the provisions of the new legislation, in the light of the principles of freedom of association.
.Certain allegations have been formulated on the subject of Title II of Legislative Decree No.  concerning the setting up of trade unions. The Committee notes that articles  and  require a minimum number of members for the setting up of a trade union ( workers representing at least  per cent of the total staff for a trade union in an undertaking;  workers representing  per cent of the staff for a works union; nevertheless, whatever their percentage,  workers can set up a trade union; similarly,  workers representing  per cent of the staff in the case of undertakings employing less than  workers or  workers for a multi-company union) in this regard, the Government states that these provisions correspond to Chilean tradition and to the general opinion of Chilean workers. According to the Government, the establishment of trade unions in small undertakings is not prohibited since the workers concerned can, in particular, set up organisations covering several undertakings. Moreover, it gives examples of unions which have been set up within small workplaces since the promulgation of the legislation.
.The Committee observes that the Labour Code which was previously in force in Chile required, for the creation of an industrial trade union, the consent of  per cent of the workers of the undertaking concerned and, for a professional trade union, a minimum of  members. The new legislation thus appears to contain more flexible provisions on this point. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that, in the case of a large undertaking, the minimum number of workers required for setting up a trade union, can be very high since it must represent  per cent of the total staff and can thus be as high as  wage-earners. In the present case, the Committee is not in a position to determine whether the application of the provisions in question will give rise to problems in practice. It wishes, however, to recall in respect of large undertakings the view which it has already expressed, according to which the setting up of a trade union can be hindered considerably or even be made impossible when the law specifies for a trade union a minimum number of members which is patently too high.
.Under article , the trade union is endowed with legal personality from the moment its Constitution is deposited with the authorities. Nevertheless, under the terms of article , the labour inspection has  days to file objections to the setting up of a trade union in the case where the formalities prescribed by law have not been performed or the Constitution does not conform with the relevant legislation. The trade union then has  days in which to take the necessary steps. In the contrary event, the legal personality is considered as cancelled by mere operation of the law. In this regard the Government states that therefore for the first time in Chile trade unions can be set up automatically.
.The Committee has always considered that the formalities prescribed by national legislation for the setting up of trade unions are admissible provided, of course, that the provisions in question do not run counter to the principles of freedom of association and that the approval of the Constitution, in particular, is not left to the discretionary powers of the administrative authorities. In the present instance, it would be desirable in particular that the decision of the labour inspectorate, and any cancellation of the legal personality which might result therefore, should be capable of being challenged in court so that the latter can re-examine the merits of the case.
.Article  of the Legislative",2,1975,Chile
305,"Decree (Title III relating to rules) specifies that rules must be approved at the constituent meeting of a trade union by an absolute majority of its members voting by secret and nominative ballot. The Government considers that this is not a restriction on the organisations' freedom in this connection, the Committee wishes to refer to a number of earlier cases in which it has been able to observe that in a number of countries, both the law and the practice require the majority of the members of a trade union - at least on the first ballot - to decide on certain questions which affect the very existence of the trade union (approval and amendment of the Constitution, dissolution, etc.). The Committee has considered that, in such cases, the legal provisions on the necessary majorities do not constitute an intervention contrary to freedom of association, provided that such regulation is not calculated to hinder seriously the running of a trade union, by rendering the adoption of decisions virtually impossible in the present case, it is not clear whether the members of a trade union, including a trade union which groups members working in several different places in the same country, must vote in person at one and the same voting assembly.
.Title IV relating to boards of management lays down a certain number of rules concerning the number of officers (article ), the requirements for eligibility (article ) and electoral procedures (articles  to ). According to the Government, the provisions of this Title have modernised the standards of the previous Code without creating restrictions. The Committee must recall on this point that legislation which makes detailed provision for election procedures within a trade union or for the composition of its executive bodies is not consistent with the right of organisations to freely elect their representatives.
.As far as the requirements for eligibility specified by the Legislative Decree are concerned, the Committee has noted with interest that certain provisions adopted in the course of the organisation of the October  elections, and which it had considered incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, have not been taken up in the new legislation (for example, the prohibition of re-election of officers and the requirements that officers should undertake not to engage in political activities). Nevertheless, the Legislative Decree maintains as a requirement for eligibility the absence of convictions or prosecutions for crimes or mere misdemeanours as well as, in the case of a works union, the requirement of two years' service with the same firm. As for ineligibility because of criminal convictions or prosecutions, the Committee is of the opinion that such a provision can run counter to the principles of freedom of association. In reality, the fact that a person has been convicted - and a fortiori in the case of a mere prosecution - for an activity which, by its very nature, is not calculated to represent a real threat to the proper discharge of trade union functions, should not constitute grounds for disqualification from nomination as an officer of a union. A mere prosecution which results in discharge of the case should not be taken into account in this connection. Similarly, the seniority requirement in the undertaking negates the right of free election; the dismissal of a trade union leader could, in such a case, make him lose also his position as a trade union leader, and thus deprive the organisation of its freedom of action and affect its right to elect freely its representatives and even favour acts of interference on the part of the employer. Furthermore, it appears from article  that the nomination of candidates is not contemplated, contrary to a practice which is very common among trade union organisations.
.In Title VI, relating to trade union funds, article  specifies that the Directorate of Labour, which has in the matter the widest right of inspection and which can act either on its own initiative or at the request of the parties, has access to the account books of the trade union. Trade union executives must submit in due time all economic, financial, accounting or patrimonial data that might be requested by the Labour Directorate if, within  days, the trade union leaders have not complied with these requests, the leaders are deposed from office by the mere operation of the law and may not be re-elected for a period of three years. The Government states generally regarding Title VI of the Legislative Decree that Chilean law has never granted such wide freedoms to trade unions.
.The Committee has repeatedly stressed the importance which it attaches to the right of trade unions to organise themselves, their activities and the administration of their affairs. As the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has underlined, in its General Survey on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining published in , the supervision exercised by the public authorities over trade union finances should not normally exceed the obligation to submit periodic reporting requirements. Inspection and furnishing of information wherever required by the authorities at their discretion entail a danger of interference in the internal administration of trade unions. Investigations should be limited to exceptional cases when they are justified by special circumstances, such as apparent irregularities revealed by the presentation of annual financial statements or complaints by members of the trade union. Furthermore, the general principle concerning the judicial control of internal acts of an occupational organisation in order to ensure an impartial and objective procedure is particularly relevant in regard to the administration of trade union property and finances. In the present case, the Committee draws these principles to the attention of the Government with particular emphasis because of the grave consequences which could result for a trade union if it does not apply the Legislative Decree on these questions, to wit the removal of the trade union leaders concerned from office and their ineligibility for a period of three years.
.In the same context of the right of trade unions to organise their administration and their activities, the Committee pointed out that article (b) of Legislative Decree No. , amending Constitutional Act No. , prohibits the participation of trade union organisations in partisan political activities. The Committee wishes to recall in this respect the comments made by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association in its report. The Commission considered that a general prohibition of political activities undertaken by the trade unions to promote their specific objectives would be contrary to the principle of freedom of association. The Commission went on to say that however, if the unions, in accordance with the wishes of their members, undertake activities of this kind, it is important that such activities should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuity of the trade union movement or its social and economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country. Governments, for their part, should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for pursuing political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of trade unions because of their freely established relationship with a political party.
.Certain allegations have been formulated concerning Title VII of Legislative Decree No.  (relating to the dissolution of trade unions) which specifies that such dissolution shall take place by judicial order (article ) and that application for it can be made by the Labour Directorate, by a trade union member, by an employer or by any other interested person (article ). The Committee considers that these provisions do not conflict with the principle according to which trade unions must not be liable to dissolution by administrative order. It notes that, on the contrary, these provisions evidence progress with respect to the Labour Code of  which made provision for the dissolution of trade unions by decree.
.Title VIII of Legislative Decree concerning federations and Confederations aims, according to the Government, at defining higher-level organisations. However, it contains certain provisions which, in the opinion of the Committee, are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. This is the case, in particular, of articles  and  which define respectively a federation as an association of more than  but less than  trade unions and a Confederation as an association of not less than  trade unions or federations, of article  which forbids federations and Confederations from participating in collective bargaining and from signing a collective agreement and of article  according to which the affiliation of a trade union to a federation or Confederation must be renewed by a general meeting every two years.
.The Committee has also observed that most of the provisions applicable to trade unions in matters of Constitution, articles of association, elections and union assets, are likewise applicable to federations and Confederations. The comments made above by the Committee on these matters are similarly applicable to these higher-level organisations which must also have the right to draft their articles of association, to",2,1975,Chile
306,"elect freely their representatives, to organise their administration and their activities and to formulate their programme of action.
.According to article  of the Legislative Decree (Title I% concerning the supervision of trade union organisations), all trade unions, federations and Confederations are subject to the control of the Directorate of Labour and must supply to the latter all the information which it requests. The Committee considers that this provision gives the administrative authorities the right to investigate at their discretion the internal affairs of a trade union and accordingly comports a risk of interference in the administration of the organisation concerned.
.As for the scope of application of the Legislative Decree, the Committee observed that its provisions are not applicable to officials employed by state bodies - centralised or decentralised (article ). The Committee wishes to recall in this respect that public officials, like workers of the private sector, should be able to set up organisations to promote and defend the occupational interests of their members. The Committee notes that the Legislative Decree is applicable to the workers of the agricultural sector who were formerly covered by a special law of , and to copper workers who were previously covered by a special regulation.
.Finally, the Committee pointed out, with regard to the transitional provisions of the Legislative Decree, that the trade union officers elected in October  pursuant to the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of  will remain in office for a period of four years (transitional article No. ). It appears, however, that the workers will have the right to censure these officers by decision taken by an absolute majority of the members of the trade union concerned, at the request of at least  per cent of the members. While noting this last provision, the Committee wishes to recall that the Legislative Decree which governed the elections of October  contained certain provisions which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association (these provisions concerned, in particular, the ineligibility of trade unionists holding office at the time of the elections as well as the requirement of non-participation in political activities).
.The Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on freedom of Association and also, on several occasions, the Committee and the Governing Body, have expressed the hope that it will soon be possible to resume the practice of collective bargaining. The Government had announced in its reports of January and May  that a new law on collective bargaining would be promulgated before  June . At its sessions of February-March and May , the Governing Body, while taking note of this declaration of the Government, had, on the recommendation of the Committee, drawn attention to certain principles, particularly with respect to the level of bargaining and the recognition of the right to strike.
.After the adoption by the Government of Legislative Decree No.  on collective bargaining, the ICFTU, in its communication of  August , claimed that certain provisions of this Legislative Decree were incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. It referred more specifically to article  (prohibition of collective bargaining at undertakings or institutions which are financed by more than  per cent by the State); to article  (prohibition of this type of bargaining with workers of more than one undertaking); to article  (prohibition of this type of bargaining for federations and Confederations) and to article  (limitation of the duration of strikes).
.In its communication of  October , the Government describes the collective bargaining system which was in force previously. It states that collective bargaining was viewed as a procedure for the obtaining of levels of remuneration as required and the redistribution of wealth without taking into consideration the workers' contributions to the undertakings or productivity. The procedure did not allow negotiations to be concluded at the level of the parties and lead to the intervention of the State. Because of this, disputes became political and required a political type of solution. This system encouraged the politisation of trade union leaders since they had to keep in contact with government officials so as to influence the solution of disputes. Moreover, the benefits won by workers were illusory. In fact, the levels of remuneration which surpassed the possibilities linked to productivity were consequently reduced by inflation.
.According to the Government, one of the most worrying questions as far as collective bargaining is concerned is the cost to the society of strikes. These factors were taken into consideration in the new legislation so as to avoid their effects. Furthermore, by allowing negotiation to take place at the level of the undertaking, disputes are localised and the seriousness of the problem and the temptation on the part of the State to interfere are reduced. Moreover, the free fixing of prices, the opening to international trade and economic policies in general have put undertakings in a situation which does not allow them to bear a dispute for a long time. Thus they cannot allow themselves to offer wages which are too low, for fear of strikes, nor too high, so as to maintain competitiveness. The balance of power between the parties, in view of one another, enables a solution to be found without the necessity of state intervention.
.The Government states that the law recognises the right to collective bargaining on all questions concerning wages and working conditions. Under the procedure, wages must effectively correspond to the specific contribution of each group of workers to the over-all output. According to the Government, this is the basic factor in the pursuance of economic progress and the correction of social injustices. Thus, continues the Government, it is advisable to place collective bargaining at the undertaking level for it is there that the contribution of each group of workers to the increase in productivity can really be measured.
.The Government goes on to describe the bargaining procedure which begins with the submission of a ""draft collective contract"" to the employer and by the election of a ""bargaining Committee"" by the means of a vote of the workers concerned. The parties bargain directly and have the right, if they so wish, to appoint a mediator. If no agreement can be reached, they can freely and voluntarily submit to arbitration. On the date of expiry of a previous collective contract, the workers may, if they have not come to an agreement with the employer, call a strike subject to the fulfilment of certain procedural rules. On the other hand, the employer may declare a lock-out, again subject to certain conditions.
.The Government states that the law provides for the maintenance of the workers' previous wage, whatever is the situation of the undertaking, taking into account a full readjustment in view of the increase in the cost of living.
.According to the Government, it is important that collective bargaining takes place between the parties without interference by the State. This can only occur where both parties have the real possibility of choice. The Government states that the ""Social Plan"" only respects this principle. It goes on to state that compulsory arbitration was not retained as a general method of arriving at collective contracts. In fact, it is of the opinion that this procedure results in the parties standing by their positions and thus makes the conclusion of direct agreements more difficult.
.However, the Government continues, in conformity with international principles, the legislation provides for the limiting or restriction of strikes in essential services or in undertakings which belong to key sectors in the society of the country. Nevertheless, the right to collective bargaining in these undertakings is not interfered with. Only as a last resort are disputes submitted to an arbitrator whose decision can be appealed before an arbitration court.
.In addition, the Government states that for the first time the legislation refers to the notion of ""unfair practices"". Therefore the refusal of an employer to bargain or to supply information in support of its contentions, physical or moral pressure against workers, the undue use of lock-outs or generally acts of bad faith which prevent the normal running of the procedure, amongst other things, are considered as interferences with the freedom to bargain collectively.
.As regards the practical application of the new Legislative Decree, the Government states that  draft collective contracts covering a total of , persons have already been submitted. It supplies a list of  undertakings in which contracts have been concluded and gives a provisional list of  undertakings where draft contracts have been prepared. Moreover, the Government states that in more than  per cent of the cases, collective bargaining has resulted in ""real"" increases in wages in the order of  to  per cent. Strikes have occurred in  per cent of cases but have only been effective in  per cent of the undertakings which were bargaining. In other cases, differences were overcome before the calling for action. At the moment, the Government states, workers in two undertakings are involved in a strike.
.The Committee notes with interest the promulgation of Legislative Decree No. ",2,1975,Chile
307,"on collective bargaining. It considers that the re-establishment of collective bargaining can constitute an important factor in the improvement of labour-management relations in the country. However, the Committee considers that some of the provisions of this Legislative Decree call for comments on its part.
.Firstly, the Committee points out that collective bargaining will not be allowed in state administrations, in companies or public and private undertakings or institutions whose budgets have been financed in the course of the past two years by the State to an extent exceeding  per cent, either directly, or through duties or taxes (article ), or in certain public utility services managed by private companies. The Government states in this regard that, in conformity with Chilean legislation, there is no collective bargaining for public institutions. In the case of those institutions covered by article , the conditions are not listed again according to the Government so that the employer can negotiate freely. The Committee feels that it must recall in this respect the terms of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention (No. ), adopted by the International Labour Conference in , article  of which specifies that - ""Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment between the public authorities concerned and public employees' organisations, or of such other methods as will allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of these matters"".
.It appears from articles  and  of the Legislative Decree that collective bargaining will operate exclusively at the level of the undertaking and that federations and Confederations may not engage in collective bargaining, even when it relates to the workers of one and the same undertaking. It also appears from the terms of the provisions concerning the procedure for calling a strike (in particular, article ) that a strike may only to decided by the absolute majority of the workers concerned in the bargaining. Accordingly, it would seem illegal for a federation or Confederation to start a strike.
.Regarding the participation of higher degree organisations in collective bargaining, the Government refers to its May  statements which the Committee examined at its previous session. The Government states that judicial proceedings are not effective in locating and punishing at first instance monopolistic practices. It continues that such practices produce nasty effects upon non-unionised workers, small trade unions, the unemployed, consumers and upon the country's economy in general. The Government observes that unions of little experience or whose power to exert pressure is insufficient have recognised the help that federations can give in collective bargaining. On the other hand, other unions have preferred to bargain through their own methods.
.The Committee wishes to recall in this regard the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its general survey of . As for denying federations and Confederations the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining, the Committee of Experts considered that restrictions of this type could give rise to serious difficulties in the development of industrial relations, particularly in the case of small unions which, on account of their limited strength and untrained leadership, may not be able by themselves to further and defend the interests of their members in an effective manner. Regarding the Government's statements on the evil effects of monopolistic practices, the Committee wishes to point out that where clauses in certain collective agreements appear to be in opposition to the considerations of the general interest, a procedure could be envisaged by which the attention of the parties is drawn to those considerations so that they can undertake a new examination, it being understood that they are to remain free in the making of their final decision.
.Article  of the Legislative Decree forbids strikes in undertakings which operate public utility services or where the stoppage of their activity would cause serious prejudice to the health, the supplies for the population, the economy of the country or national security. According to the Legislative Decree, these latter undertakings must represent a significant part of the branch of activity concerned in the country or the stoppage of their activity must make it wholly impossible for a section of the population to receive the services concerned. A list of these undertakings is drawn up every year by a joint decision of the Ministers of Labour, National Defence and Economic Affairs. A compulsory arbitration procedure applies to all the undertakings in question in the event of failure to reach direct agreement. The list drawn up this year, according to the information provided by the Government, includes  undertakings ( public and  private) belonging to the following sectors: certain copper mines, telephones, explosives, telecommunications, public transport, rail transport, air transport, maritime transport, water, electricity, gas, petrol, ports. In this regard the Government states that the special geography of the Chilean territory requires that there should be no paralysation of transport and communication.
.In a general manner, the Committee admitted that the right to strike can be made subject to restrictions, and even prohibition in the government service or essential services, if these limitations are accompanied by corresponding guarantees, because a strike could cause severe damage to the national community. It also considered that strikes cannot apparently but result in such damage if they take place in undertakings that constitute a key sector for the life of the country. The Committee noted that some of the undertakings which appear at present in the list drawn up by the Government seem to correspond to those which are normally considered as essential in the strict sense of the word. However, the Committee must recall that it has pointed out on several occasions, and particularly in cases concerning ports, banks, oil companies and transport, that the principle concerning the prohibition of strikes in essential services may well become meaningless if a strike in one or more undertakings which do not furnish an essential service in the strict sense of the word, i.e. services whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population, is declared illegal. In the present case, it appears that the listing, made each year by the Government, of the undertakings in which the right to strike is denied could lead to the drawing up of an unduly extensive list by reference to the criteria mentioned above.
.Article  of Legislative Decree No.  enumerates certain matters which may not be the object of collective bargaining. The Committee considers that some of these matters (particularly those which would imply an obligation on the employer to pay salaries to strikers for the strike days, and those which refer to the creation of funds which grant benefits entirely or partly financed by the employer) should not be systematically considered as being outside the scope of collective bargaining.
.As indicated above, the decision to strike must be taken by the absolute majority of the workers concerned (article ). The same is also true for the prolonging of a strike where a vote is called for by the bargaining Committee representing the workers or else by  per cent of the workers concerned (article ).
.In this matter, the Committee must point out that, according to the terms of the voting procedure thus laid down, it may be difficult to obtain an absolute majority, particularly in the case of a trade union having a large number of members. This provision therefore involves the risk of substantial restrictions upon the right to strike.
.The Committee also points out that, according to article , the employer can recruit such workers as he considers necessary and that under article , the workers who maintain their decision not to return to work after  days of strike are considered as having voluntarily resigned. The Government states on this point that the average length of strikes in Chile was  days, and that it is very important for employers to avoid prolonged work stoppages.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall the principle already stated in earlier cases' according to which the use of groups of persons to fill the jobs abandoned as a result of a labour dispute may, if the strike is otherwise legal, only be justified if there is a need to assure the functioning of services or industries whose breakdown would create a situation of acute crisis in the present case, the Committee considers that the combined application of the two above-mentioned provisions involves the risk of weakening considerably the position of the workers and of their organisations in the defence of their occupational and economic interests. Moreover, the Committee wishes to point out that the provision under article  involves a substantial restriction of the right to strike since it in fact limits the duration of strikes to a maximum of  days.
.In accordance with the provisions of article  of the Legislative Decree, in the event of a strike or",-1,1975,Chile
308,"a lock-out which, because of its nature, timing or length, causes serious prejudice to health, supplies for the population, the national economy on national security, the President of the Republic may by decree order the resumption of work for a period of  days. The decree in question shall appoint a member of the corps of arbitration to act as mediator. In addition, article  of the Legislative Decree which amends article  of Law No.  on the security of the state, specifies that in the case of an illegal strike which causes serious prejudice to any industry that is vital to the national economy or occurs in any transport undertaking, in any farm on establishment which produce or process goods or articles essential to national defence or to supplies for the population or which provide public services or public utility services, the President of the Republic may order the resumption of work with the help of the civilian or military authorities. In these cases, the workers must return to work under conditions identical to those prevailing at the date of the illegal stoppage of work.
.In this respect, the Committee must stress in general terms the fact that measures of mobilisation or requisition of workers during a labour dispute lend themselves to abuse, and also the undesirability of recourse to such measures, except where they are taken in order to ensure the maintaining of essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that transitional article  provides for a staggering of times for returning to collective bargaining and the entry into force of the collective contracts which run, depending on the undertaking, from  August  to  June . The Committee would hope that the Government will continue to supply information on the practical application of the Legislative Decree as regards collective bargaining, particularly on the number of contracts concluded, on the number of workers covered, and on the undertakings involved.
.At its May  session, the Committee examined certain allegations made by the Latin American Central of Workers regarding the dismissal on  March  of Daniel Lillo, President of the National Association of Customs Employees of Valparaiso.
.The Committee had noted that this measure had been taken by the Regional Governor (Intendente) of the Valparaiso region in accordance with Legislative Decree No.  of . This Legislative Decree empowers intendentes and governors to demand the resignation of members of the executive Committees, amongst others, or workers' organisations in the public sector, on the ground that serious impediments prevent that organisation from functioning, and to appoint replacements. If the person concerned does not resign within the stated time limit, the intendente or governor issues a decree removing the person concerned from his position as a leader of the organisation. In the present case, the Government claims that Mr. Lillo had given to the Press a false account of a meeting which he had not attended. Moreover, the Committee noted that the Customs Administration was carrying out an administrative investigation into the case. Consequently, the Governing Body, while emphasising the importance of using judicial procedures in cases of dismissal of trade union leaders, urged the Government to supply information on the result of this investigation.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that Mr. Lillo had been temporarily suspended from his employment. In this regard, the Committee must recall that one of the basic principles of freedom of association is that workers must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, and that this protection is particularly desirable for trade union leaders. In fact, to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, the latter must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they held from their trade unions. Respect for this principle is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the right of organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee would like the Government to indicate whether Legislative Decree No. , which is the basis for the measures taken against Mr. Lillo, has been repealed as far as workers' organisations in the public sector are concerned.
.Certain allegations have also been put forward by various complainant organisations regarding the dissolution by the Government in October  of seven trade union organisations. According to the Government, the conduct of the organisations thus dissolved showed that their methods of action and objectives coincided with the principles and aims of the Marxist doctrine. The organisations in question lodged a Constitutional appeal for protection before the Santiago Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the Governing Body had urged the Government to supply information on the results of these judicial proceedings, as well as information on the ultimate destination of the assets of the dissolved organisations.
.The Government states that the Appeal Court of Santiago dismissed the organisations concerned in the first instance. This decision was confirmed by a Supreme Court decree relating to four of these organisations. The matters involving the three other organisations are still taking place. The appeals for protection were rejected because the plaintiffs had requested the courts to declare Legislative Decree No.  inapplicable on the ground that it was unconstitutional. The Court could not pronounce on this issue because the appeal was for protection, whereas it ought to have been for inapplicability. The Government states that the parties concerned had the necessary time to present this latter form of appeal before the Supreme Court. Regarding the use of the assets of the dissolved organisations, the Government goes on to state that this question is under study and that it should be resolved to the benefit of the workers.
.The Committee notes that the Supreme Court rejected, on procedural grounds, the appeal brought before it by four of the dissolved organisations. The three other matters are still under way. In these circumstances, the Committee can only recall that occupational organisations must not be subject to measures of suspension or dissolution by administrative authority. The Committee is also of the opinion that the right to appeal is not always a sufficient guarantee. In fact it is important that judges can examine the case on its merits and study the reasons for the dissolution of an organisation. In addition, the Committee wishes to ask the Government to supply information on the outcome of the appeals still under way.
.In the various stages of the consideration of the case, the Committee has examined a number of allegations concerning the imprisonment and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In a report examined by the Committee in November , the Government gave information concerning  out of the  persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report. In March , the Government pointed out that the Santiago Court of Appeal had delegated one of its judges to discharge the special mission of considering the cases of those persons who had presumably disappeared while on trial before one of the tribunals of the Santiago Court of Appeal district. These cases concerned  of the persons mentioned in the complaints. At its session of May , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, urged the Government to continue to forward information on the result of the pending proceedings and, in a general way, on the persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report.
.In its communication of  October , ICFTU states that  corpses bearing signs of torture have been discovered near the Yumbel cemetery. According to statements of the inhabitants of the area, the bodies had been buried at the end of October . A large deployment of military forces and police had been seen at the time in the surroundings. ICFTU states that two of the bodies have been identified as trade union leaders from the paper industry at Lafa.
.The Government states that proceedings are following their course before the Court of Appeal. Consequently, the Committee wishes to reiterate its request for information made in its last report. In addition, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet answered the new allegations.
.In their complaint of  September , the Professional Trade Union of Seafarers and the Port Employees' Trade Union alleged that the Intendente and the Governor of the Province of Concepcin issued two decrees, Nos.  and  of  and  September , which prevented the organisation of a trade union meeting for the purpose of designating the organising Committee of the ""Group for the defence of the rights of the workers of the Province of Concepcin"". According to the complainants, the authorities adopted these decrees on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations devoid of all legal foundation.
.Regarding these latter allegations, the Government states that the development of a free trade union movement requires the maintenance of public order so that the exercise of their rights is guaranteed to all citizens. According to the Government, this",-1,1975,Chile
309,"meeting was called by a small group of trade union leaders so as to hinder the nominal trade union activities in the Province of Concepcin and to interfere with public order. The Government states that Chilean law provides for legitimate methods, which are appropriate and easy to utilise, for groups representing workers to form organisations. But, in order to do this, these must be a gathering of the assemblies of the affiliated unions. Finally, the Government observes that collective agreements are not normally carried out in the Province of Concepcin.
.While noting the Government's statements, the Committee points out that the planned meeting was to deal with trade union themes. Moreover, according to the allegations, the organisations and participants were trade unionists from different organisations. In this regard it wishes to point out that the authorities ought to avoid any interference of such a nature as to limit the right to hold trade union meetings or to restrict the legal exercise thereof.
.In these circumstances, and regarding the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the adoption of new legislation on trade union organisations and collective bargaining:(i) to note with satisfaction the abrogation of Legislative Decree No.  which had been adopted in December  and which imposed serious restrictions on trade union activities;(ii) to note that the promulgation of the Legislative Decrees on trade union organisations and collective bargaining constitute a first important step in the application of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee in relation to certain provisions of this legislation, which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining with a view to introducing the necessary amendments.(iv) to express the hope that the legislation will be thus applied in a spirit conforming to the principles of freedom of association and with respect to civil rights, the importance of which had been stressed by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(v) to request the Government to forward information on the implementation of the recommendations referred to in subparagraph (a)(iii) above and to continue to supply information on the practical application of the Legislative Decrees;(b) regarding the removal from office of Mr. Lillo:(i) to point out to the Government the principles expressed in paragraph  above concerning the importance of protection against acts of anti-union discrimination;(ii) to request the Government to indicate whether Legislative Decree No.  has been abrogated as far as workers' organisations in the public sector are concerned;(c) regarding the dissolution of several trade union organisations:(i) to bring the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraph  above;(ii) to request the Government to supply information on the results of the appeals still under way;(d) regarding the detention or disappearance of trade union leaders or members, to request the Government to continue to supply information on the outcome of the proceedings under way and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report and to provide its observations on ICFTU's new allegations;(e) with regard to the prohibition of a meeting in the Province of Concepcin, to point out that the authorities ought to avoid any interference of such a nature as to limit the right to hold trade union meetings or to restrict the legal exercise thereof;(f) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee last examined this case at its February  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Since the Committee last examined the case, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) has made allegations with regard to the removal from office of a trade union official in a telegram addressed to the ILO on  March . In addition the following organisations have sent communications dated as indicated below concerning measures taken by the Government in connection with the celebration of May Day: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( April ), World Confederation of Labour ( April and  May ), World Federation of Trade Unions ( April and  May ), Latin American Central of Workers ( May ).
.The Government, for its part, has supplied the text of statements made by the Minister of Labour and certain information in communications dated  March and  May . It has furnished its observations in communications dated  May and  May .
.In a statement made on  January , the minister of Labour made public the substance of the ""Social Plan"" setting out the Government's basic objectives and decisions regarding the establishment of a new institutional system for labour matters. The Government stated that the process of working out the ways and means of implementing this ""Social Plan"" had involved numerous meetings with workers' and employers' leaders.
.According to the Government, the principles underlying this ""Social Plan"" should lead to a system of trade unionism with the following characteristics:- free trade unionism, meaning the right of the workers to act collectively through trade unions formed and organised according to the wishes of their members with no other restrictions than those established by law to ensure respect of the common good and the proper functions of the trade unions;- democratic trade unionism, meaning the freedom of the members to appoint their executive organs and the guarantee that the latter act in conformity with the decisions taken by the members;- trade unionism endowed with resources, meaning the obligation of the members to pay contributions to their organisation;- independent and depoliticised trade unionism, which must exclude any use of the trade union organisation by groups or interests which were foreign to it, whatever their nature or origin.
.In presenting the general outline of this ""Social Plan"", the Minister indicated that the law respecting trade union organisations would be enacted before  June . The Government subsequently announced the promulgation of two legislative decrees, one respecting the right of assembly and the other providing for the collection of union dues by a voluntary system of deduction at source.
.At its February-March  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation:(i) noted that the Pew trade union legislation was due to be adopted before  June ;(ii) noted with interest that two legislative decrees covering organisations in every sector had been adopted to guarantee the right of trade unions to meet and to favour the collection of members' fees;(iii) recalled to the Government's attention the recommendations formulated by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission concerning the adoption of new trade union legislation;(iv) expressed the firm hope that the Government would be able to provide all the necessary information for a thorough examination of the Bill and the measures envisaged for its application by the Committee at its next session.
.The Government recalls in its communication of  May  that the objectives of the ""Social Plan"" are the strengthening of freedom, the promotion of justice and the establishment of a broad framework propitious to effective progress from which the entire population can benefit. It confirms that the law respecting trade union organisations will be promulgated not later than  June . The guiding principles for the organisation and activities of trade unions as set out in this law will be the development of a free, democratic and independent trade union movement, endowed with its own resources.
.In the meantime, the Government has adopted two legislative decrees: one on the right of assembly of trade unions (Legislative Degree No. , as amended by Legislative Decree No. ), and one on the financing of trade union organisations (Legislative Decree No. ). The Government states that by virtue of the two first mentioned of these legislative decrees Chile has officially guaranteed the freedom of trade union organisations to hold assemblies and meetings without hindrance of any kind. It recalls that Legislative Decree No.  has repealed transitional section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , thus recognising the freedom of trade unions, federations and Confederations to hold meetings outside working hours. Subsequently, Legislative Decree No. , published in the official Gazette on  May , has improved the text of the earlier measure, which lent itself to various interpretations as to the places where it was permissible to hold meetings. Under the new legislative decree, ordinary or extraordinary meetings of trade union organisations (unions, federations and Confederations) may be held at the headquarters of any such organisation, outside working hours, to deal with the affairs of that organisation. Thus, points out the Government, the legislation no longer provides for any restriction of the right of assembly. Moreover, this right has been exercised in practice by trade union organisations since  January last.
.With regard to the new trade union law, the Government gives the following explanations:- it will recognise the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing,",-1,1975,Chile
310,"whether they be first degree trade unions, federations or Confederations;- the preliminary draft of the new Political Constitution of the State, which will shortly be the subject of a referendum, provides that trade union organisations shall be granted legal personality subject to no other formality than the depositing of their Constitutions and rules with an independent body in accordance with a procedure to be prescribed by law;- the new legislation will recognise freedom of assembly without supervision by the authorities, already widely exercised today;- it will establish a procedure for the election, removal from office and replacement of union officials in full freedom and by secret ballot, without interference by the authorities or by extraneous elements;- it will guarantee the freedom to run their own affairs and autonomy of organisations by making improvements in the law on trade union dues (Legislative Decree No. ) so as to enable trade unions to be financially independent. In this connection, the Government recalls that the laws and regulations presently in force provide for machinery for financial control by the general assembly and supervisory Committee of a trade union;- it will provide for an appeal to lie with the courts of justice to settle any cases which may arise in connection with the dissolution of trade union organisations.
.In conclusion, the Government states that freedom to join the trade union of one's choice and freedom for each union to determine the amount of the dues to be paid by its members and to elect its officials are the main, necessary features on which the new law will be based. The Bill is now in the final stages of drafting and is still the subject of debate in the legislative bodies and consultation with the organisations concerned.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements as concerns the promulgation of the new trade union legislation, due to take place by  June  at the latest. It notes with interest that in the meantime the Government has adopted a new legislative decree which amends the provisions adopted in February  with respect to the right of assembly of trade union organisations in trade union premises and abolishes the requirement that the authorities be notified in advance which still subsisted in certain cases. However, the Committee must point out that trade unions ought to have the right to freely organise meetings either in trade union premises or in other appropriate premises.
.The Committee has examined the guiding principles for the new trade union legislation. It notes with interest that, as communicated to the Committee, they appear to have taken account to a large extent of the principles mentioned by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission in its recommendations with regard to the adoption of new trade union legislation. Nevertheless, the Committee must point out once again that it cannot express its views as to the conformity of the new legislation with the principles of freedom of association until it has at its disposal all the necessary information, and in particular the full text of the new provisions. In this connection it must express its deep regret that the Government has not found it possible to supply the text of the Bill before it becomes law. In these circumstances, the Committee can only urge the Government to take all the necessary measures so that the new legislation will be adopted before  June next and will contain provisions complying with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and that the text will be sent promptly to the Committee so that it can evaluate its conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee further considers it desirable to insist once again on the need for the bringing into force, speedily and fully, of legislation complying with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission so as to put an end to all the restrictions on trade unions which have now been in force for nearly six years.
.In presenting the Government's ""Social Plan"" at the beginning of January , the Minister of Labour stated that what had to be aimed for was a system of collective bargaining which would be:- effective and just, which would suggest that it be conducted within each undertaking;- technical, which would require that both parties negotiate with full knowledge of the relevant factors involved and with the aid of any technical assistance required;- responsible and integrated, which could only be achieved within the framework of conciliation procedures. According to the minister, striking could not be legally accepted when it affected services in the public interest or when a work stoppage seriously impaired the populations' health or food supplies, the country's economy or national security. On the other hand, in cases where the State or the population was not vitally affected, there was nothing preventing the possibility of occupational strikes and lock-outs.
.The Minister of Labour further pointed out that his statements on collective bargaining did not concern employees of the State and municipalities. Finally, he indicated that the legislation respecting collective bargaining would enter into force before  June .
.At its February  session, the Committee noted with interest that the procedure of compulsory arbitration would not be applied to all collective labour disputes. It pointed out, however, that the law should not stand in the way of the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations concerning conditions of work. In drawing the Government's attention to these principles and considerations, the Governing Body expressed the hope that collective bargaining would be restored in the very near future.
.In its communication of  may , the Government confirms that the law on collective bargaining will be promulgated before  June . It recalls that its aim is to provide workers and employers with negotiating machinery which will be efficient, fair, technically competent and responsible. The ""Social Plan"" recognises the right of workers to associate for the collective negotiation of their rates of pay so that these may be consistent with the productivity of the sector of the undertaking concerned. This implies that, for both employers and workers, collective bargaining should take place within each undertaking. This is not a hard-and-fast rule, as special circumstances justifying its waiving may arise in activities where the labour force is exceptionally mobile.
.As concerns the Committee's recommendation to the effect that ""the law should not stand in the way of the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations concerning conditions of work"", the Government states that the new legislation does not preclude such participation. On the contrary, it recognises in broad and clear terms the role of federations and Confederations. These organisations are in effect in a better position to carry out certain tasks of interest to workers employed in different undertakings in a given branch of activity. They may also be of great value in training officials of first-degree unions and assisting them prior to or during negotiations.
.The Government points out that in the interest of consumers, it must ensure that in certain sectors a few workers' or employers' organisations do not acquire monopolistic powers enabling them to secure excessively advantageous pay rates or privileges. According to the Government, in certain sectors there is in fact a tendency towards collusion between employers' and workers' associations with a view to reaching settlements which are mutually advantageous. However, these settlements are not based on an improvement in productivity and are thus detrimental to consumers as they result in higher prices. The Government goes on to state that it is accordingly necessary to make the laws against monopolies of either workers or employers more severe.
.The Committee notes that collective bargaining at the undertaking level - a system traditionally used in Chile and sanctioned by the Labour Code formerly in force, - will be re-established under new legislation on the subject. The Committee is of the opinion that the reintroduction of collective bargaining is an important step forward in the restoration of trade union freedoms.
.The Committee notes that federations and Confederations will be allowed to give advice and assistance in connection with collective bargaining, and that it will be permissible for such higher-degree organisations, in certain cases, to negotiate directly the conditions of employment of their constituents. The Committee further notes that the general rule it is intended to observe in establishing the legal framework for collective bargaining at the undertaking level reflects the desire to prevent the creation of monopolies either on the employers' or on the workers' side. In this connection, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the importance of the principle that voluntary negotiation of collective agreements between employers' and workers' organisations should be promoted. The Committee observes that the system of collective bargaining provided for would result in practice in negotiations between individual employers and unions at the undertaking level, excluding employers' organisations and higher-degree workers' organisations. In these circumstances, the Committee is of the opinion that, to prevent all these organisations from being debarred a priori from taking part in collective bargaining, the combating of possible",2,1975,Chile
311,"abuses that might result from the creation of a monopoly should be left to the judicial authorities.
.In their communications, the ICFTU, the WCL, the WFTU and the CLAT refer to the ban on May Day celebrations imposed by the Government. The complaining organisations state that when the police intervened during demonstrations in Santiago, people were injured and more than  were arrested. In Valparaiso, too, more than  workers were arrested.
.The complainants also state that the international trade union Confederations and several of their affiliates had sent delegations to manifest their solidarity with the Chilean workers. The delegates from the CLAT and from a number of Spanish Confederations were refused entry on their arrival in Chile.
.The Government remarks that on  May the legislation on the freedom of assembly of trade union organisations was already in force. The Minister of Labour had publicly stated that the workers could celebrate Labour Day at meetings of their organisations. The Minister of the Interior, for his part, refused to authorise a meeting in the streets that a group of persons including several trade union leaders had expressed the wish to organise. This meeting had been described as an ""artistic and cultural gathering"". However, owing to the political nature of statements made by the organisers, the Government considered that it was its duty not to authorise such a gathering, in accordance with the provisions concerning the keeping of the peace.
.The Government points out that in Chile authorisation has always been required for the holding of peaceful gatherings in public places. Certain leaders had accordingly stated that if they did not obtain authorisation to hold the meeting they would not participate in any action in breach of the traditional standards of public order. However, another group preferred to exploit May Day for political purposes, called for the breaking off of the dialogue with the Government and provoked the authorities into refusing permission for the meeting. This group organised a rally of  persons.
.The disturbances which followed, and in particular the physical assaults upon the police, led to the arrest of  persons, including  students,  white-collar workers and technicians,  housewives,  self-employed persons,  persons without any known occupation and  wage earners. No trade union officials were arrested. Fifty-two persons were prosecuted ( for assaults on policemen and  for breaches of the State Security Act). All the others were released by order of the judicial authorities.
.The Government remarks that at that very moment the labour authorities were meeting with , trade union officials to analyse the most important features of the new laws to be adopted shortly.
.In conclusion, the Government states that it is untrue to assert that it banned the celebrating of May Day. Far to the contrary, it reminded trade unions that they were absolutely free to hold meetings all over the country to commemorate this important date.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the  persons remaining in custody have been released by decision of the Court of Appeal of Santiago, against which the Government will not appeal.
.The Committee notes that the persons arrested during the May Day demonstrations have now all been released. It nevertheless wishes to emphasise, as it has done on countless occasions, and in particular in connection with the present case, that the right to organise public meetings and processions on May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights, provided the legal provisions on public order are observed. The Committee further draws attention to the fact that the Government has not furnished observations on the allegations concerning the expulsion of foreign trade unionists who had come to celebrate May Day in Chile. Although governments have a sovereign right to decide who shall and who shall not be admitted to their territory in accordance with the legislation applicable to aliens in general, the Committee wishes nevertheless to stress the importance it attaches to the right of national trade unions to maintain relations with occupational organisations in other countries and international Confederations.
.At various stages in the examination of this case, the Committee has examined allegations concerning the detention or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In a report examined by the Committee in November , the Government provided information on  of the  persons mentioned in the list established by the Committee in its th Report. In February , the Government stated that there were no trade unionists detained in Chile. At that time the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the persons mentioned in the th Report, and in particular on the results of the efforts made to trace missing persons.
.In this connection the Government states that on  March , the Supreme Court instructed the Court of Appeal of Santiago to appoint one of its judges to undertake a special mission to investigate and pronounce decisions on cases of persons presumed missing still pending in the courts within its jurisdiction. These cases involve, inter alia, the following persons: Jos Luis Baeza, Carlos Contreras Maluje, Hctor Manuel Contreras, Jos Corvaln, Juan Elias Cortez, Uldarico Donaire, Jaime Patricio Donato, Humberto Fuentes, Mario Jess Juica, Guillermo Glvez, Fernando Lara, Guillermo Martinet, Juan Moraga, Miguel Morales, Miguel Nazal, Rodolfo Marcial Nuez, Luis Recabarren G, Manuel Recabarren R, Raimundo Riquelme, Jorge Salgado, Jos Santander, Pedro Silva Bustos, Jorge Solovera, Jos Toloza, Julio Roberto Vega, Carlos Vizcarra, Jos Arturo Weibel, Ricardo Weibel, Juan Gianelli, Carlos Lorca Tobar, Exequiel Ponce, Jos Sagredo Pacheco, Fernando Navarro, Waldo Pizarro and Fernando Ortiz. The Supreme Court has issued the same instruction to the Court of Appeal of Talca with respect to the case of Luis Eduardo Vega Ramirez. The Government will communicate the results of the proceedings pending in due course.
.The Committee notes that judges of the courts of appeal of Santiago and, Talca are investigating the cases of missing persons, most of whom have been mentioned in the complaints before the Committee it once again requests the Government to continue to supply information as to the results of the efforts made to trace these persons, and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list included by the Committee in its th Report.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the adoption of new trade union legislation:(i) to note with interest that the guiding principles announced by the Government in preparing the new trade union legislation took account of the principles set out in the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(ii) to express its regret that the Government has not found it possible to supply the text of the Bill before it becomes law;(iii) to urge the Government to take all the necessary measures so that the provisions of the new legislation will comply with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and so that they will be adopted as soon as possible, and that the text will be sent promptly to the Committee so that it can evaluate their conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(iv) to insist on the need for this legislation to be brought into force speedily and fully so as to put an end to the restrictions on trade unions;(b) as regards the right to hold meetings;(i) to note with interest the adoption of Legislative Decree No.  to supplement Legislative Decree No.  as concerns the right to hold meetings in trade union premises, without previous authorisation;(ii) however, to point out that trade unions ought to have the right to freely organise meetings either in trade union premises or in other appropriate premises;(c) with regard to collective bargaining:(i) to note that the Government confirms that the new law on the subject will be promulgated not later than  June ;(ii) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above as concerns the level at which collective bargaining would take place;(d) with regard to the removal from office of on Lillo:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above as concerns measures for the removal from office of trade union officials;(ii) to request the Government to supply information as to the results of the administrative inquiry carried out by the customs authorities;(e) with regard to the dissolution of several trade union organisations, to request the Government to supply information as to the outcome of the appeals pending in the courts and as to the ultimate destination of the assets of the dissolved organisations;(f) with regard to the incidents which occurred on May Day :(i) to note that all the persons arrested are now at liberty;(ii) to recall that the right to organise public meetings and processions on May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights, provided the legal provisions on public order are observed;(iii) to stress the importance of the right of national trade unions to maintain relations with occupational organisations in other countries",0,1975,Chile
312,"and international Confederations;(g) with regard to the detention or disappearance of serving or former trade union officials, to note that judges of the courts of appeal of Santiago and Talca have been instructed to investigate the cases of missing persons, including many trade unionists, and to request the Government to continue to supply information as to the results of the proceedings pending and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list included by the Committee in its th report;(h) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Since it last examined the case, the ILO transmitted to the Government for its comments communications from the complainant organisations concerning the measures taken by the Government in regard to trade union matters in October . The communications in question were from the World Federation of Trade Unions (dated  October ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (dated  October ), the International Metalworkers' Federation (dated  October ), the International Federation of Textile, Garment and Leather workers (dated  October ), and the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (dated  November ). The ILO also transmitted a letter from the United Front of Chilean Workers (dated  December ) and communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions dated  December  and  January , respectively, supporting the allegations made by a Committee for the defence of trade union rights in Santiago de Chile in a letter dated  October . Moreover, the World Confederation of Labour transmitted, on  December , a communication from the Latin American Federation of Textile, Clothing, Footwear, Leather and Allied Workers referring to the same facts as the allegations previously received from the other complainants.
.For its part, the Government forwarded information and comments in communications dated  November ,  and  January  and ,  and  February . It should also be recalled that the Government had sent a report dated  October  which the Committee had been unable to examine in depth at its November  Session.I. Question of the adoption of new trade union legislation
.In a statement made in October , which the Committee had noted at its last session, the Minister of Labour had announced that the draft Labour Code was nearing completion and that the Government had adopted a legislative decree which guarantees full freedom for workers to establish trade unions.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted that the new trade union legislation was nearing completion and expressed the hope that the Committee would be able to examine this at its February  Session and that it would be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government indicates that the Minister of Labour has received and studied reports of the Council of State regarding trade union rights and collective bargaining. In an annex to this communication it is stated that the competent Committee of the Council of State held talks with numerous leaders of national organisations of workers and employers in different sectors of activity. The list of persons consulted shows that the workers' leaders heard by the Committee belonged to various trends in the trade union movement.
.The Government also declares that the draft reform of the political Constitution is currently being examined by the Council of State. The final text will contain basic standards relating to trade union rights and collective bargaining it will be submitted to a referendum.
.The present Minister of Labour, appointed at the end of , made public in a statement made on  January  in the presence of leaders of workers' and employers' organisations, the substance of the ""Social Plan"" setting out the Government's basic objectives and decisions regarding the establishment of a new institutional system for labour matters.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government states that the process of working out the ways and means of implementing this ""Social Plan"" has involved numerous meetings with workers' and employers' leaders. In addition, a high-level special Committee has been set up to collect the proposals submitted by leaders representing the various trends and to submit as soon as it can conclusions concerning the final draft of the trade union legislation.
.The principles underlying this ""Social Plan"", as given out by the Minister of Labour, should lead to a system of trade unionism with the following characteristics:- Free trade unionism, which means the right of the workers to act collectively through trade unions formed and organised according to the wishes of their members with no other restrictions than those established by law to ensure respect of the common good and the proper functions of the trade unions. This freedom entails as corollaries the right of the worker to join or leave a trade union by the voluntary and intransmissible exercise of his own free will, as well as the right of the trade union assembly to act as the central decision-making body of the trade union. As regards the number of trade unions that there may be in an undertaking and the right to form federations and Confederations, the law will have to lay down standards which allow the workers the variety they desire and at the same time meet the requirements for a rational and efficient functioning of the economy and the undertakings.- Democratic trade unionism, which means the freedom of the members to appoint their executive organs and the guarantee that the latter act in conformity with the decisions taken by the members.- Trade unionism endowed with resources, which means the obligation of the members to pay contributions to their organisation. Such contributions could be made by deduction at source by decision of each member in the case of a works union and of the majority of the members in the case of federations and Confederations.- Independent and depoliticised trade unionism. This must exclude any use of the trade union organisation by groups or interests which are foreign to it, whatever their nature or origin. In view of past experience it is imperative not to permit the politicisation of trade unions and the prevent their being directed by persons engaged in party political activities or propagating doctrines contrary to the fundamentals of the institutional system. Decisions concerning each individual case of ineligibility and incompatibility will rest with independent tribunals. To offset these restrictions, the elected trade union leader will enjoy guarantees ensuring his independence in the exercise of his functions.
.In presenting the general outline of this ""Social Plan"", the Minister indicated that the law respecting trade union organisations would be enacted for  June . Its enactment forms part of a gradual process which in the immediate future means establishing the widest possible freedom of assembly and adopting standards designed to facilitate the payment of workers' contributions to their unions.
.The Minister of Labour indeed announced the adoption of a resolution of the Minister of the interior, dated  January , addressed to all the country's provincial administrators and governors, whereby all the executives of trade union organisations, be they trade unions, federations or Confederations, are authorised to hold ordinary or extraordinary meetings with their members to deal with the organisation's affairs without it being necessary to request prior authorisation from the competent authorities. Such meetings must be held at union headquarters and outside working hours. The provisions have been taken up again in Legislative Decree No.  published in the Official Journal on  February ; the Legislative Decree abrogates, moreover, section  of Legislative Decree No.  relating to union meetings. It specifies that, if the organisation has no premises in which to hold its meetings, it can hold them in private premises provided that previous notification is given to the nearest police station. The provisions in question equally apply to associations of public servants as well as to employee groups in the public or semi-public sectors.
.Legislative decree No.  was also promulgated on  February  with a view to granting facilities to workers' organisations to enable them to collect contributions from their members without delay. The system adopted provides for the possibility of using, on a voluntary basis, the system of deduction of contributions at source by the employer. According to the Government, this arrangement has been favourably received both by the employer and by the workers it also applies to union organisations in agriculture as well as to public servant associations. Lastly, Legislative Decree No.  provides that the affiliation of a trade union to an organ of higher level must be decided by an absolute majority of unionists during a",0,1975,Chile
313,"meeting especially called for this purpose at which an Inspector of Labour or Notary must be present. The decision to affiliate must be reviewed every two years and decisions to collect trade union contributions by federations and Confederations must be ratified by first degree general meetings to be of effect.
.The Government indicates finally, that it will provide more detailed information on the new trade union legislation for the next session of the Committee, since by then it will be in a position to give exact details of the content of the standards to be adopted once all the opinions have been heard.
.The Committee notes the statement of the Minister of Labour according to which the new trade union legislation is due to be adopted before  June . The Committee considers, in the light of the information provided by the Government, that the main principles underlying this legislation should permit the adoption of provisions ensuring greater respect of the principles of freedom of association than those which were in force. In addition, the Committee notes with interest that provisions have been adopted with a view to guaranteeing freedom of assembly for trade union organisations. It also notes that a legislative decree to facilitate the collection of trade union contributions has been promulgated.
.The Committee will not, however, be able to express its opinion in full knowledge of the facts as to whether the new trade union legislation is in conformity with the generally recognised principles on the matter until it is in possession of the complete text of the relevant provisions. The Committee notes in this regard the assurance given by the Government that more detailed information will be provided for its next session. In this context, and bearing in mind the concerns expressed within the ILO in regard to the trade union situation in Chile, the Committee cannot overemphasise the importance of its being able to examine the provisions of the legislation before their envisaged promulgation in June . It therefore expresses the firm hope that the Government will be in a position, for its next session, to provide it with all the information necessary for a thorough examination of the draft legislation as well as the measures envisaged by the Government for implementing the new law.
.In the meantime, the Committee considers it useful to recall the recommendations formulated by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission respecting the adoption of new trade union legislation. The Commission had considered that such legislation should, to be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association enshrined in the Constitution of the ILO and in order to be able to ratify the freedom of association Conventions, should recognise, in particular, the following principles:
.The Committee must also stress the value of systematic and thorough consultation of employers' and workers' organisations in the course of drafting trade union legislation. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Minister of Labour held talks with leaders representing various trends in the trade union movement as well as with employers' representatives.
.Finally, the Committee must point out that it would be highly desirable for the new legislation to be implemented in full as rapidly as possible so as to put an end to the major restrictions which have been imposed on trade union organisations since .II. Trade union activities(a) Collective bargaining.In a speech delivered in October , the Minister of Labour had indicated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile had overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining would take place at the level of the undertaking.
.In a speech delivered in October , the Minister of Labour had indicated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile had overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining would take place at the level of the undertaking.
.At their November  Session, the Committee and the Governing Body had expressed the hope that, when restoring collective bargaining, the Government would take account of the principles expressed by the Committee concerning compulsory arbitration which would be contrary to freedom of association.
.In presenting the Government's ""Social Plan"" at the beginning of January , the minister of Labour stated that what had to be aimed for was a system of collective bargaining which would be:- effective and just, which would suggest that it be conducted within each undertaking, without prejudice to the exceptions strictly necessary in the case of activities where such an arrangement would not be viable;- technical, which would require that both parties with full knowledge of the relevant factors involved and with the aid of any technical assistance required;- responsible and integrated, which can only be achieved within the framework of conciliation procedures since experience proved that mediation and arbitration arrangements did not enjoy the necessary confidence to facilitate equitable and peaceful solution of wage negotiations. Because of this, strikes proliferated to the extent that, instead of being the last resort in an unresolved conflict, they became a regular and immediate means of seeking a solution to such dispute. It is clear that striking cannot be legally accepted when it affects services in the public interest or when a work stoppage seriously impairs the population's health or food supplies, the country's economy or national security. In requiring compulsory arbitration in these cases, Chile is following the pattern prevailing in the most advanced democracies in this field. On the other hand, the situation is different in undertakings where strikes do not have such effects on society and where the problem is confined to a dispute between employers and workers without vitally affecting the State or the population. In these cases, there is nothing preventing the possibility of occupational strikes and lock-outs.
.In winding up this point, the Minister of Labour pointed out that his statements on collective bargaining did not concern employees of the State and municipalities. Finally, he indicated that the legislation respecting collective bargaining would enter into force before  June .
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government on this point, in particular regarding the early adoption of new legislation on collective bargaining. The Committee also notes with interest that, according to the statements of the Minister of Labour, the procedure of compulsory arbitration would not be applied to all collective labour disputes, contrary to what had been previously announced, but only to limited cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the re-establishment of collective bargaining which the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission had already declared to be a general aspiration of trade union circles, will be effective in the very near future. In the opinion of the Committee, this would constitute an important factor in improving industrial relations in the country.
.The Committee noted nevertheless that, according to the statement of the Minister of Labour, the framework for collective bargaining will be mainly at the level of the undertaking. In this regard, the Committee considers it useful to point out that the law should not stand in the way of the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations concerning conditions of work.(b) Allegations concerning collective labour disputes
.Some of the complainant organisations, and in particular the ICFTU and the WFTU, had referred to collective labour disputes which had recently taken place in Chile, particularly in the mining sector at Chuquicamata. The complainants explained that, after two years of fruitless action to obtain higher wages, the workers of Chuquicamata had submitted, on  August , a list of the following social and economic demands: a  per cent increase in wages, an increase in the residence allowance, an increase in the production bonus and scholarships for children who were studying. The management of the public mining undertaking reacted by dismissing trade union leaders who had taken part in the assembly during which the list of demands had been approved. In protest against these measures and against the prices of meals in the undertaking, the miners began what has been known as the ""canteen strike"", refusing to take their meals in the canteens of the undertaking.
.Following this movement, the Government declared a state of siege throughout the province. This measure had various consequences, in particular the obligation to submit a duly justified written request for the holding of any meeting or assembly, to be presented  hours in advance to the Garrison Commander. Movements of persons within the province and leaving the province were controlled, as was entry to the mines, to which only the workers were allowed access. In addition, workers were arrested, sent to a remote part of the country, or placed under house arrest.
.In",2,1975,Chile
314,"its report submitted in October , the Government had indicated that the dispute had been settled by negotiations, as a result of which various bonuses and allowances had been granted to the workers and that the workers dismissed had been reinstated. In addition, the workers who were arrested had been released.
.The Government states moreover in its communication dated  January  that there was no strike movement during this collective dispute but only a refusal to take meals in the canteens of the undertaking as a mark of protest against the delay in satisfying their claims. Some elements sought to make use of this legitimate protest to obtain political benefits, a move which the Government prevented in so far as it went beyond the occupational scope of the activities which trade unions should exercise. Furthermore, a worsening of the dispute would have affected the entire national economy. No trade union leader was involved in the activities which were extraneous to the purely occupational movement. The Government repeats that the workers dismissed for having participated in subversive activities were all reinstated. It declares that the relocation of certain workers had been of brief duration and that the place of residence assigned them was only  kilometres from Chuquicamata. Finally, the Government indicates that, in the course of the negotiations, relations were never severed between the management of the undertaking and the trade unions, and the dispute was settled a month and a half after it had begun.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government regarding this collective labour dispute. It notes that the dispute in question did not involve a strike but only a protest action in support of claims of an occupational nature. According to the Government, the dismissals and placing under forced residence of certain workers were carried out because of the subversive activities conducted by the persons concerned on the occasion of this dispute. These measures were later rescinded.
.While noting this statement, the Committee is bound, however, to point out that the dismissals of workers occurred very shortly after the general assembly had decided to launch the protest movement. Moreover, the articles which appeared in the Chilean press concerning this affair show that trade union leaders of all tendencies called for the reinstatement of those concerned. The Committee also observes that the declaration of a state of siege in the region following the events in question resulted in major restraints being placed upon the activities of the trade union organisation, in particular as regards the right of assembly.
.The Committee notes, finally, that the dispute was settled through agreement between the parties. As a result, it considers that, while drawing the attention of the Government to the considerations expressed above, it would be pointless to go any further into this aspect of the case.(c) Trade union elections
.Several complainant organisations, including the ICFTU, the WCL and the WFTU, sent communications protesting against the method employed by the Government in organising the trade union elections on  October . Some of them state that the , trade union leaders who were in office prior to that date were unable to present their candidatures.
.In a communication dated  November , the Government supplied the text of Legislative Decree No.  concerning the change of trade union executive Committees by election, and of Legislative Decree No.  confirming these elections. The Committee had also noted a speech made by the Minister of Labour announcing the organisation of these elections shortly before the date fixed for them to be held and describing the procedure adopted as well as the conditions of eligibility established.
.At its November  Session, the Committee proposed to examine this question in a more detailed manner at its next session. It had, however, noted that the legislative decree on the elections contains provisions on ineligibility and had indicated that, in principle, the lifting of the prohibition to hold trade union elections which was in force to date by virtue of Legislative Decree No.  of , could signify progress, provided that the principles of freedom of association are respected including the right of workers freely to elect their representatives. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit information concerning the reasons for maintaining these cases of ineligibility.
.At its present session, the Committee examined carefully the regulations on the organisation of these elections transmitted by the Government. Legislative Decree No. , dated  October , reveals that the elections concerned basic organisations in the private sector, i.e. at the undertaking level. The scope of the legislative decree excluded organisations in the public sector as well as in the agricultural, maritime and copper sectors. This legislative decree provides, in section , that workers' trade unions will be administered by an executive Committee consisting of three persons. Section  introduces amendments to section  of the former Labour Code respecting conditions of eligibility for the functions of trade union leader. According to the article as amended, to be elected to the leadership of a trade union organisation persons must possess the following qualifications:(a) they must be at least  years of age;(b) they must be Chilean. However, foreigners married to persons of Chilean nationality and persons residing in the country for more than five years may become trade union leaders;(c) they must not have been sentenced for a crime or misdemeanour, and an action for a crime or misdemeanour must not be pending against them;(d) they must be able to read and write;(e) they must have five years' unbroken service with the undertaking (except where the undertaking has existed for less than five years);(f) they must not have engaged in party political activities, been active in a political party, had responsibilities a public representative or as a representative of a political party during the preceding ten years.Non-fulfilment of any of these eligibility conditions during a trade union leader's term of office will constitute grounds for incapacity to exercise the functions of the office. However, in its communication of  February , the Government points out that the fact of having exercised political activities will not constitute a ground for ineligibility. An incompatibility will only exist when a political office and trade union function are carried out simultaneously..In accordance with section  of the legislative decree, the Directorate of Labour is responsible for seeing that the rules laid down in section  of the Labour Code, as amended, are applied at all times. The Directorate of Labour will deal with questions arising in connection with the conditions established in paragraph (f) of this section and will settle them according to a procedure fixed by regulations. The person concerned will be able to appeal to the competent court for labour matters at the headquarters of the trade union within five days, without any possible extension. The court must call upon the Director of Labour to prepare a report which must be submitted within  days. It must hand down its judgement within the following  days.
.In accordance with section  of the legislative decree, the Directorate of Labour is responsible for seeing that the rules laid down in section  of the Labour Code, as amended, are applied at all times. The Directorate of Labour will deal with questions arising in connection with the conditions established in paragraph (f) of this section and will settle them according to a procedure fixed by regulations. The person concerned will be able to appeal to the competent court for labour matters at the headquarters of the trade union within five days, without any possible extension. The court must call upon the Director of Labour to prepare a report which must be submitted within  days. It must hand down its judgement within the following  days.
.According to section , to assume his functions as a trade union leader, the member must swear the following oath before the competent labour inspector: ""I swear that I fulfil the conditions required by the law to perform the duties of leader of a trade union organisation, that I do not and will not participate in political activities or in a political movement during the exercise of my duties, that I shall not attempt to politicise trade union organisations by distorting their objectives, that I shall not consent to be a party to such ends and that my sole objective shall be the just representation of the affiliated workers."" Two copies of the oath will be drawn up and signed jointly by the trade union leader and the labour inspector.
.The Legislative Decree also contains temporary provisions respecting the organisation of the elections on  October . All trade union members who fulfilled the conditions set forth in the Decree are candidates. Consequently, the presentation of candidatures is not authorised. Each union member has two votes and the three persons who have obtained the greatest number of votes are elected. The election must be conducted in the presence of a labour inspector or an official appointed for",2,1975,Chile
315,"this purpose. The elected leaders will hold office for a period of four years. The oath required by the Legislative Decree must be sworn within  days of the election. The leaders who are currently holding offices which are not subject to election under the Legislative Decree must swear a similar oath to that required of the new leaders. Those who do not comply with this obligation will cease to exercise their functions. Finally, persons whose term of office was prorogued or who were appointed under the terms of Legislative Decree No.  may not be appointed as trade union leaders.
.The various communications from the Government show that Legislative Decree No.  laid down temporary standards and that the final procedure for trade union elections will be defined in the new legislation. In the view of the Government, the elections carried out on  October  had the merit of being the first to be held with a truly secret ballot. The Government also points out that  per cent of the workers concerned voted. As regards the conditions of eligibility laid down by the Legislative Decree, the Government points out that these applied both to the leaders whose term of office had been prorogued by Legislative Decree No.  (and hence elected before September ) and to those appointed in accordance with the temporary standards placed on seniority. The Government also states that the elections have not produced consequences for federations and Confederations for the latter are administered by their own by-laws and these do not require leadership in a first-degree organisation so as to become a member of their controlling organ. Finally, the Government states, in its communication dated  January , that the new trade union legislation will not retain this type of exclusion.
.In his speech of  January , the Minister of Labour also indicated that all future trade union elections would be governed by permanent provisions. Moreover, these provisions will provide for the possibility for a specified number of members of a trade union which has renewed its executive Committee in accordance with Legislative Decree No.  to call for the removal from office of the leaders once only in the course of their term of office. A new election will then be held according to the terms of the final legislation on the subject.
.The Committee considers that the right of workers' organisations to elect their leaders freely constitutes an indispensable condition for them to be able in fact to act in full freedom and to promote the interests of their members effectively. For this right to be fully acknowledged it is essential that the public authorities refrain from any intervention which might interfere with the exercise of this right, whether it be in determining conditions of eligibility of leaders or in the conduct of the elections themselves.
.The Legislative Decree which governed the elections of  October  laid down conditions of eligibility, some of which raised problems of compatibility with the principles of freedom of association, in particular the provisions concerning seniority in the undertaking, the fact that candidates may not have been sentenced or have an action pending against them for a crime or misdemeanour (i.e. including offences which might not be grounds for justified disqualification for the exercise of trade union functions), and non-participation in political activities. As regards this last point, the Committee also notes that the newly elected leaders, or those remaining in office, have been required to swear an oath in order to exercise their functions and to permit themselves thereby not to engage in political activities. The Committee considers that the imposing of such an obligation on trade union leaders might involve restrictions on the freedom of action of trade union organisations incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee notes that, in addition to these conditions of eligibility, the Legislative Decree laid down a temporary standard ruling out the election of leaders whose term of office was extended or who had been appointed by virtue of Legislative Decree No. . In other words, in the trade unions in which elections had been held, the trade union leaders in office at the time of the elections, including those who had been elected before , could not be candidates. The Committee considers that such an exclusion was not only contrary to the principles of freedom of association, but it also deprived these organisations of experienced leaders.
.Nevertheless, the Committee notes the recent statements of the Minister of Labour according to which new elections would be held before the term of office of the leaders elected in October  expires, and that these elections will be organised on the basis of the new trade union legislation which, according to the Government will not retain this type of exclusion. In this regard the Committee notes the Government's statement that the fact of having exercised political functions will, in the future, no longer constitute a ground of ineligibility.
.The Committee notes, finally, that the number of leaders of an organisation should be limited to three persons. It considers that matters of this type should be for the trade union organisations themselves to decide.III. Measures affecting trade union officials and organisations(a) Removal from office and dismissal of trade union leaders.Complaints had been presented regarding the removal from office and dismissal of several trade union officials. Certain of these concerned four copper workers' officials (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Onion of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellan, Director of the same union; and Arturo Latuz, Director of the Occupational Onion of Caletones).
.Complaints had been presented regarding the removal from office and dismissal of several trade union officials. Certain of these concerned four copper workers' officials (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Onion of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellan, Director of the same union; and Arturo Latuz, Director of the Occupational Onion of Caletones).
.The four leaders in question had been dismissed from their jobs. In these cases it seems that the undertaking had recourse to one of the reasons for dismissal introduced in the legislation by Legislative Decree No.  of , namely the participation in illegal acts provoking the absence of workers. The persons mentioned had been assigned to residence, and there had been a work stoppage for absenteeism on the part of certain of the workers of El Teniente (the measure of assignment to forced residence had been rescinded subsequently). The persons concerned had appealed to the labour court. As a result of their loss of employment they had automatically lost their trade union responsibilities and had been replaced by new trade union leaders under the procedure provided for in Legislative Decree No. .
.The Government had stated in its report of October  that Juan Fincheira, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz had reached an agreement with the National Copper Undertaking before the Court of Rancaqua, by virtue of which the undertaking cancelled the dismissal of these persons. For their part, the persons concerned had given up the responsibilities they exercised within the National Copper Undertaking, El Teniente Division, as well as everything which goes with being a worker in the El Teniente Division, starting from  November . The persons concerned had in addition received various indemnities including a special and voluntary one, amounting to  months' wages and  months' in the case of Arturo Latuz (in compensation for the trade union immunity of which he could possibly avail himself).
.Since its last session, the Committee has received allegations stating that the agreement reached between the National Copper Undertaking and the leaders removed from office was not arrived at in accordance with the will and desires of the persons concerned but as a result of the pressure exercised on them and their families and the distressing economic situation in which they found themselves.
.For its part, the Government states in its communication of  January  that the parties agreed not to await the judgement of the Court of Rancagua and requested the Court to approve an agreement which would terminate all controversy. The indemnities were granted in accordance with the law and accepted freely by the parties - there can be no doubt about this since the workers benefited throughout from the advice and support of capable and freely chosen defence.
.The Committee notes that the dispute between the four leaders in question and the National Copper Undertaking was the subject of an agreement between the parties. It notes, however, that contradictory statements have been made on this point, the allegations stating that pressure was put on the leaders, while the Government stresses their free acceptance of the agreement in question. In this regard, the Committee notes that the agreement was",2,1975,Chile
316,"reached before the competent court and that the trade union leaders were able to be assisted by freely chosen defence counsel. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that it would be pointless to pursue the examination of this aspect of the case.
.The complaints also referred to the removal from office of trade union leaders in the public sector (in the National Confederation of Workers' Association in the State Bank of Chile - Messrs. Andrs del Campo Hamel and Arturo Moreno Patio - and the National Federation of Maritime Employees - Mr. Carlos Frez). In addition, new allegations refer to dismissals and removal from office of trade union leaders in the teaching (Messrs. Esteban and Ilabaca) and public works (Messrs. Jorge Ramirez and Luis Muoz) sectors.
.In its report, dated  October , the Government had stated that, as regards the leaders of the National Confederation of workers' Associations in the State Bank of Chile, the term of office of these persons, according to the rules of the organisation, was two years. Their term of office should, therefore, have ended in  and they remained in office solely by virtue of the temporary standards which prolonged the term of office of trade union leaders. Because of the extreme length of the period in which they had exercised their functions and at the request of the staff of the Bank themselves, the Government had put an end to the term of office of Andrs del Campo Hamel and Arturo Moreno Patino. The appointment of their replacements on the executive Committee of the Confederation was effected by the persons concerned themselves. The Government added that the two leaders in question continued to perform their occupational functions in the bank. Finally, the Government stated that standards would be laid down within  days to govern the organisation of bank workers.
.The WFTU and the ICFTU, for their part, referred to the promulgation of Legislative Decree No. , dated  October , in which there is a provision authorising the Minister of the Interior to dismiss any official of the public service without any guarantee or immunity.
.In its communication of  February , the Government supplies information about unionists in the maritime sector as well as the education and public works sectors about whom it is alleged that they have been removed and, in some cases, dismissed. Regarding the Chairman of the Harbour Workers' Federation, Carlos Frez, the Government points out that he was replaced by the Vice-Chairman because he had made use of the organisation for aims not related to the interests of the union and incompatible with the functions vested in him. The person concerned has been submitted to an administrative procedure conforming to the decree with force of law, No.  of , and consequently, his services in the undertaking have been terminated. There are no legal proceedings over this affair. Messrs. Esteban and Ilabaca, from the education sector have on their part been submitted to proceedings examined by the regional secretariat of the Minister for Education at Curico for infringement of the decree with force of law, No.  of . Those concerned have not presented any appeal. The Government is not aware that Mr. Esteban has been a union leader, whereas Mr. Ilabaca was until . As regards Messrs. Jorge Ramirez and Luis Muoz, members of the workers' association of public works, the Government points out that these two persons were removed by their own union in December . Subsequently they underwent an administrative procedure for absence from work. Finally, the Government points out that no official has been dismissed by virtue of Legislative Decree No. , which has been in force for over three months.
.The Committee notes the information provided regarding the removal from office tad dismissal of public sector workers' leaders. This raises the more general problem of the right to organise in the public sector. The  Labour Code provides, in section , that wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State or municipal authorities or belonging to State undertakings do not have the right to form a union or to belong to any union. Likewise, section  of the Administrative Regulations prohibits wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State from forming trade unions. Nevertheless, for many years now, public sector workers have formed various organisations of a trade union nature.
.The Committee makes a point of recalling in this regard that the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission had considered that the right to form organisations of their choice should be granted to all workers both in the private and in the public sector, including officials in the service of the State. The granting of this right to public employees means that they must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, as was stressed by the International Labour Conference in adopting the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).(b) Dissolution of several trade union organisations
.Allegations were presented by several complainant organisations concerning the dissolution by the Government of certain trade union organisations in October . The Committee had taken note, at its November  Session, of the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of  October  (published in the Official Journal) concerning the dissolution of seven trade union organisations. The reasons set out in the decree indicate, in the first place, that it is the duty of the State to ensure that ""intermediate institutions"" act within the limits of their competence, and to protect citizens against activities which may lead, directly or indirectly, to the development of social strife or subversive doctrines that are contrary to the general interest. Secondly, it is stated that the conduct of those organisations mentioned in the legislative decree shows that their means of action or their objects coincide with Marxist principles or objectives. For this reason, the decree continues, these organisations have seriously and persistently distorted the nature of their functions to such a point that their existence and their functioning are incompatible with the necessity to safeguard national unity.
.Accordingly, the following are prohibited and considered as illegal organisations: the Ranquil Confederation, the United Confederation of Peasant Workers, the National Federation of Metallurgical Unions, the Occupational Union of Construction Workers of Santiago, the National Union of Textile and Clothing Workers, the Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Construction workers and the Industrial National Federation of Mineworkers. These organisations were dissolved and their legal personality, where appropriate, removed. The legislative decree specifies moreover that the same applies to their affiliate organisations (section ). Finally, the assets of the dissolved organisations are transferred to the State (section ).
.However, in its communication of  November , the Government, referring to an official statement of the Director of Labour, pointed out that the dissolution measure had not been applied to the basic unions since the affiliated organisations had not been counted exactly. In addition, the Minister of the Interior had indicated that the current holding of their assets is only temporary and that the Government has decided that these assets are intended for the workers in the undertaking concerned and that they will have full and free use, management and possession of them.
.At its November  Session, the Committee had, in particular, pointed out that the procedure followed in this case for the dissolution of these organisations was not compatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be dissolved by administrative authority. Accordingly, the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee requested the Government to provide, as soon as possible, its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In its communications of  January and  February , the Government states that all the organisations concerned had lodged a Constitutional appeal for protection before the Santiago Court of Appeal and that, as a result, the matter is pending in the civil courts. The Government adds that the workers have not been deprived of the right to organise and that they retain the possibility of forming and promoting organisations for the legitimate defence of their interests. Moreover, it points out that, in accordance with the law, the assets belonging to the dissolved organisations have been listed by the minister of Public Property and will be destined for the organised workers themselves if the Court denies the appeals for protection. The Government also points out that the organisations affiliated to the dissolved groups have not been touched by the dissolution measures. The Government will be mindful of the principles set out by the Committee on this question in its ""Social Plan"" to be put into concrete form in the new legislation.
.The Committee notes that the dissolved organisations have lodged an appeal and that the case is pending before the judiciary. The Committee would like to be informed about the results of these court proceedings. It considers that it would also be useful for it to be provided with information on the subsequent assignment of the assets of these dissolved organisations.IV. Civil liberties relevant to the exercise",0,1975,Chile
317,"of trade union rights
.At various stages in the examination of this case, the Committee examined allegations concerning the detention and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In its report of  October , the Government had provided information on  of the  persons mentioned in the list established by the Committee in its th Report. While noting this information the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on this list.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that there are no trade unionists actually detained in Chile. Regarding the persons who are presumed disappeared, it indicates that it will continue to keep the ILO informed of the result of the searches underway and of the cases instituted before the judiciary.
.The Committee notes this statement made by the Government and requests it to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on this list, in particular on the results of the efforts made to trace the missing persons.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the adoption of new trade union legislation:(i) to note that this is due to be adopted before  June ;(ii) to note with interest that two legislative decrees covering organisations in every sector were adopted on  February  to guarantee the right of trade unions to meet and to favour the collection of members' fees;(iii) to recall to the Government's attention the recommendations formulated by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission concerning the adoption of new trade union legislation, cited in paragraph  above;(iv) to express the firm hope that the Government will be able to provide all the necessary information for a thorough examination of the Bill and the measures envisaged for its application by the Committee at its next session;(b) as regards collective bargaining, to point out to the Government the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs  and  above, and to express the hope that collective bargaining will be restored in the very near future;(c) as regards the collective dispute at Chuquicamata, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations expressed in paragraphs  to , and to decide that, taking into account the agreement reached between the parties, further examination of this aspect of the case would be pointless;(d) as regards trade union elections:(i) to stress that the right of workers organisations to elect freely their leaders constitutes an indispensable condition for them to be able in fact to act in full freedom and to promote effectively the interests of their members, and to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs  to  above;(ii) to point out that the exclusions practised in the elections of October  were not in conformity with these principles;(iii) to note, however, the statement of the Government that new elections could be held in the trade unions concerned on the basis of the new trade union legislation that will not include different types of exclusions required in the elections of October ;(e) as regards the removal from office and dismissal of the trade union leaders:(i) to note that an agreement was concluded between the copper workers leaders mentioned in the complaints and the CODELCO undertaking, and to decide that, for this reason, further examination of this aspect of the case would be pointless;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle whereby public sector workers should enjoy the right to organise and adequate protection against acts of antiunion discrimination;(f) as regards the dissolution of several trade union organisations, to note that an appeal has been lodged by them in the courts, and to request the Government to provide information on the results of these judicial proceedings and on the subsequent allocation of the assets of the dissolved organisations;(g) as regards the detention or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, to note the statement of the Government in paragraph  and request it to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on the list established by the Committee in its th Report, in particular on the results of the efforts made to trace missing persons;(h) to take note of this interim report.
.The last report sent by the Government of Chile under article  of the ILO Constitution concerning the measures taken to give effect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission was examined by the Committee and the Governing Body at their May-June  Session. On this occasion the Committee also examined Case No. . It is appropriate to recall that the Committee examined the matters at issue taking account of the information gathered by the representative of the Director-General during a direct contact mission between  and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At the May-June  Session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the trade union situation by  October  and its observations on the allegations made in Case No. .
.Since it last examined the case, the Committee has received communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( September,  and  October ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (, ,  September and  October ), the World Confederation of Labour ( and  October ), the International Union of Workers in Agriculture, Forests and Plantations ( October ), the International Union of Public Service and Allied Workers ( October ), the International Union of Building, Wood and Construction workers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( October ), and the International Union of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers ( October ). The Government sent, by a communication dated  October , the text of certain statements made by the Minister of Labour. The Government also sent a report dated  October  and a communication dated  November . Because of the late date on which these communications were received the Committee was unable to examine these at its present session. It proposes to examine the matters raised in these communications in a more detailed manner at its next session.
.Because the new allegations submitted by the new organisations within the context of Case No.  cover various important aspects of trade union life, the Committee decided to examine the questions relating to the evolution of the trade union situation and the case before it concerning Chile in a single document.I. Question of the adoption of new trade union legislation
.In its previous report the Government had stated that Book II of the draft Labour Code, which deals with trade union rights, was being examined by the Council of State, which had reported on the question around the middle of . The Government further indicated that the ministry of Labour was finalising the text of these provisions. In this connection the authorities told the representative of the Director-General that the promulgation of new trade union legislation was part of a process of evolution of which the first stage would be the adoption of a new system of collective bargaining.
.At its May  Session, the Committee, while taking note of the developments in the trade union situation and, in particular, of the Government's intention to restore collective bargaining, pointed out that a system of collective bargaining presupposed the absence of restrictions on the legitimate activities of trade union organisations, especially as regards their internal administration. Such a system presupposed, in particular, that trade union organisations should be able freely to call meetings and should be represented in the course of negotiations by leaders who were freely elected by their members. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, pointed out to the Government that one of its priorities should be the repeal of Legislative Decree No.  and the promulgation, as soon as possible, of legislation in conformity with the principles of the ILO.
.In a statement made on  October  the Minister of Labour reaffirmed that freedom of association was one of the main orientations in the new institutional labour system and that there could only be restrictions of this freedom on grounds affecting the general interest. The new concept of trade unionism, stated the Minister, fully recognises the right of occupational organisations to protect their legitimate interests provided that they adopt a responsible attitude. This attitude necessarily implies that their interests are compatible with the common good, a fact which eliminates the systematic development of social conflict, but which, on the other hand, implies the seeking of solutions to social conflicts by means that are peaceful and just.
.The minister announced that the draft Labour Code was nearing completion and that the Government had adopted a legislative decree which guarantees full freedom of workers to",1,1975,Chile
318,"establish trade unions. In future, the setting up of a trade union would be decided by more than  per cent of established workers in an establishment or enterprise. This percentage should not represent less than  workers. Non-unionised workers will be represented by the works delegate and will contribute to the expenses connected with the collective agreement. The distinction that, up to now, existed between unions of workers and employees will be abolished. A special statute has been adopted for public servants.
.The Committee notes the statement that the draft Labour Code is nearing completion and that henceforth a legislative decree adopted by the Government guarantees freedom to workers to establish trade unions. The Committee hopes that it will be able to examine the provisions of the new Labour Code at its next session and that these will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association, and in particular, with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.II. Trade union activities in the country(a) Collective bargaining.The Government had stated in its earlier report that the country's economic situation had considerably improved. Nevertheless, conditions were not yet suitable for the reestablishment of the normal collective bargaining machinery, which was to remain suspended until  March . The Government further stated that a new system of collective bargaining was in an advanced stage of consideration. The system of automatically readjusting remuneration at quarterly intervals continued to be applied, as did the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of , which extended the scope of agreements in writing, collective agreements, arbitration awards and tripartite Committee decisions to all workers in the branch of activity concerned.
.The Government had stated in its earlier report that the country's economic situation had considerably improved. Nevertheless, conditions were not yet suitable for the reestablishment of the normal collective bargaining machinery, which was to remain suspended until  March . The Government further stated that a new system of collective bargaining was in an advanced stage of consideration. The system of automatically readjusting remuneration at quarterly intervals continued to be applied, as did the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of , which extended the scope of agreements in writing, collective agreements, arbitration awards and tripartite Committee decisions to all workers in the branch of activity concerned.
.With regard to the tripartite Committees, the Government referred to the information already supplied in November  to the effect that their decisions were now accorded deliberative status. It confirmed that it was the task of the government representatives on these Committees to safeguard the general interest by preventing excesses prejudicial to the community. However, the role played by the State would gradually become more and more secondary.
.The Minister of Labour further told the representative of the Director-General that restoration of collective bargaining would perhaps take place in  and that the provisions which would require to be taken to this effect were being studied. It was foreseen that in case the parties did not reach agreement, either directly or through mediation, recourse would be had to arbitration as a final solution. The arbitrators would be nominated by agreement between the parties or by independent bodies such as the courts.
.At its May  Session, the Committee noted with interest the trend in favour of restoration of collective bargaining. Nevertheless, it pointed out that what seemed to be envisaged was that, in the absence of an agreement between the parties in the collective bargaining process, the dispute which would result would be dealt with by compulsory arbitration. In other words, recourse to strikes would be prohibited. The Committee recalled the recent statement made by the minister of Labour according to which recognition of the right to strike would also be examined within the framework of the process of normalisation. In this connection the Committee recalled that the right to strike constituted one of the essential elements whereby workers and their organisations might promote and defend their occupational interests. While a prohibition of the right to strike might be acceptable during collective bargaining or during the validity of a collective agreement or in the case of public servants or essential services, a general prohibition of the right to strike would be contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In his speech of  October  the Minister stated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile have overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining will take place at the level of the undertaking. The Minister also pointed out that the trade union elections would enable collective bargaining to take place with a more solid representation for Chilean workers.
.The Committee notes the statements made by the Minister of Labour regarding this question. These confirm the information already provided by the Government at the last session of the Committee. The Committee hopes that, when restoring collective bargaining, the Government will take account of the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee at its last session concerning compulsory arbitration for collective disputes in general, which would be contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(b) Collective labour disputes
.Some of the complainant organisations referred to collective labour disputes which had recently taken place in Chile. For example, in a telegram of  September , the ICFTU states that following a strike by the miners of the Chuquicamata copper mine, the authorities declared a state of siege in the region, arrested  workers and dismissed others.
.In its three communications of September , the WFTU also refers to the situation in the Chuquicamata mining sector. The complainant organisation explains that, after two years of fruitless action to obtain higher wages, the workers of Chuquicamata submitted, on  August , a list of the following social and economic demands: a  per cent increase in wages, an increase in the residence allowance, an increase in the production bonus and scholarships for children who were studying. The management of the public mining undertaking reacted by dismissing trade union leaders who had taken part in the assembly during which the list of demands had been approved. In protest against these measures and against the prices of meals in the undertaking, the miners began what has been known as the ""canteen strike"", refusing to take their meals in the canteens of the undertaking.
.Following this movement, the Government declared a state of siege throughout the province. This measure had various consequences, in particular the obligation to submit a duly justified written request for the holding of any meeting or assembly, to be presented  hours in advance to the Garrison Commander. Movements of persons within the province and leaving the province were controlled, as was entry to the mines, to which only the workers were allowed access. In addition, six workers were arrested and sent to a remote part of the country, and three others were placed under house arrest. The number of arrests increased, continues the WFTU, reaching  on  September. The complainants supplied a list of  persons who were arrested on charges of ""political activism"" and adds that further arrests have reportedly been made of miners who are presumed to be active in the Christian Democratic and Communist Parties. In addition, according to the WFTU,  miners have been threatened with dismissal.
.The WFTU reports that talks between the Government and the copper miners' leaders have been interrupted, and that the chairman of the CODELCO public copper undertaking did not attend the meeting with the trade union leaders, which was scheduled to be held in Santiago.
.Finally, the complainant organisation refers to a further ""canteen strike"" which is said to have been followed by about a thousand of the , workers of the Huachipato works of the Pacific Steel public undertaking for the purpose of obtaining a  per cent over-all increase in pay. This claim was presented to the undertaking a few months ago.
.The texts of the communications transmitted by the complainant organisations concerning this matter were sent to the Government, which transmitted certain information thereon in a report dated  October . It states, in particular, that the dispute has been settled through negotiations and that the workers who were dismissed have been reinstated. In addition the workers who were arrested have been released.
.The Committee notes this information. It proposes to examine this question in a more detailed manner at its next session.(c) Trade union elections
.Several complainant organisations, in particular the ICFTU, the WCL and the WFTU, sent, on ,  and  October , telegrams to the ILO protesting against the method employed by the Government in organising the trade union elections on  October . The ICFTU and the WCL state that the , trade union leaders presently in office are unable to present their candidatures. According to the ICFTU this is a trick by",2,1975,Chile
319,"the Government to gain control over the trade union movement. The WFTU considers that this measure violates trade union rights.
.The Director-General transmitted these recent protests of the complainants to the Chilean Government. In its communication of  November  the Government provides the text of Legislative Decree No.  concerning the change of trade union executive Committees by election, and of Legislative Decree No.  concerning these elections.
.The Minister, in his speech of  October , had stated that free, direct and secret elections would take place in the unions in undertakings in the private sector on  October . If, in the future, a minimum membership period of two years is required for participation in elections for trade union leadership, this time all unionised workers will be able to vote in their own organisations. The new executive Committee will consist of three persons.
.The Minister continued that, in order for these elections to constitute the start of a new phase of Chilean trade unionism, conditions of eligibility have been established in order to guarantee, in particular, the ""depolitisation"" of trade union life. To this end, there will be no formal presentation of candidates in these elections. Workers will be able to vote for any member of the union who has been at least five years in the undertaking (or two years if the undertaking has existed for less than five years). Those persons who have participated in acts of a party political nature, or who have been active in a political party or who have had party political or other responsibilities or who have represented a political party cannot be elected to office. In addition, no trade union leader actually in office can be re-elected in the course of these new elections. This last rule does not mean that the authorities are unaware of the work accomplished by the present leaders, but it has become necessary to promote a new generation of trade union leaders. Every trade union leader who does not fulfil the eligibility conditions will cease to exercise his functions. All questions concerning the lack of eligibility or the cessation of functions of trade union leaders will be dealt with by the Director of Labour, with a right of appeal to the courts mentioned in the legislative decree. The elections will take place in the presence of a labour inspector whose task will be to see to it that they take place in due form. The newly-elected leaders will hold office for a period of four years. Finally, the Minister indicated - referring to the employers - that the authorities would punish severely any attempt to prevent or in any way hinder the taking place of the elections. The Government, in its report dated  October , confirms the statements made by the Minister.
.The Committee proposes to examine this question in a more detailed manner at its next session. It has, however, noted that the legislative decree on the elections contains provisions on ineligibility. It considers it appropriate to make certain preliminary comments on the matter. In principle, the lifting of the prohibition to hold trade union elections which was in force to date by virtue of Legislative Decree No.  of , could signify progress, provided that the principles of freedom of association are respected including the right of workers freely to elect their representatives. The Committee would request the Government to transmit information concerning the reasons for maintaining these cases of ineligibility.III. Measures affecting certain trade union officials and organisations(a) Removal from office and dismissal of trade union leaders.At its May  Session the Committee examined complaints relating to the removal from office or dismissal of a number of trade union officials. The first concerned three officials of a copper miners' union (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Union of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellano, Director of the same union); two officials of the National Confederation of Bank Associations of the State of Chile, namely the President, Andrs del Campo Hamel, and the Vice-President, Arturo Moreno Patio; the President of the National Federation of Port Workers of Chile and the National Federation of Maritime Workers, Mr. Carlos Frez Rojo.
.At its May  Session the Committee examined complaints relating to the removal from office or dismissal of a number of trade union officials. The first concerned three officials of a copper miners' union (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Union of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellano, Director of the same union); two officials of the National Confederation of Bank Associations of the State of Chile, namely the President, Andrs del Campo Hamel, and the Vice-President, Arturo Moreno Patio; the President of the National Federation of Port Workers of Chile and the National Federation of Maritime Workers, Mr. Carlos Frez Rojo.
.The three trade union leaders of the copper workers and Arturo Latuz, director of the occupational union of Caletoras had also been dismissed from their jobs. In these cases it seems that the undertaking had recourse to one of the reasons for dismissal introduced in the legislation by Legislative Decree No.  of , namely the participation in illegal acts provoking the absence of workers. The persons mentioned had been assigned to residence, and there had been a work stoppage or absenteeism on the part of certain of the workers of El Teniente (the measure of assignment to forced residence had been reported subsequently). The persons concerned had appealed to the labour court and the matter was still being dealt with. As a result of their loss of employment they had automatically lost their trade union responsibilities and had been replaced by new trade union leaders under the procedure provided for in Legislative Decree No. .
.At its May  Session the Committee recalled that national legislation which laid down that all trade union leaders must belong to the occupation in which the organisation functioned might jeopardise the exercise of trade union rights. In fact, the dismissal of a worker who was a trade union leader could, by making him forfeit his position as a trade union official, affect the freedom of action of the organisation and the right of the workers to freely elect their representatives and might even encourage acts of interference by employers. Furthermore, the Committee considered that the cases relating to trade union leaders in the banking and maritime sectors pointed to the existence of discretionary intervention on the part of the administrative authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions which was incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to intervene with a view to the reinstatement of those concerned in their trade union functions and, in the case of dismissal, in their employment, and to transmit the text of the judgement to be handed down in the cases of Juan Fincheira, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz.
.The Government states in its report dated  October  that the four former trade union leaders in the copper industry reached an agreement with the management of the National Copper Undertaking before the Court of Rancagua. The Government annexes a copy of their agreement to its report. The Committee will examine this information at its next session.(b) Dissolution of several trade union organisations
.Shortly before the session of the Committee, allegations were presented by several complainant organisations concerning the dissolution by the Government of certain trade union organisations. The communications sent to the ILO in this connection were transmitted to the Government, whose observations on the matter have not yet been received.
.The Committee has taken note of the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of  October  (published in the Official Journal) concerning the dissolution of seven trade union organisations. The reasons set out in the decree indicate, in the first place, that it is the duty of the State to ensure that ""intermediate institutions"" act within the limits of their competence, and to protect citizens against activities which may lead, directly or indirectly, to the development of social strife or subversive doctrines that are contrary to the general interest. Secondly, it is stated that the conduct of those organisations mentioned in the legislative decree shows that their means of action or their objects coincide with Marxist principles or objectives. For this reason, the decree continues, these organisations have seriously and persistently distorted the nature of their functions to such a point that their existence and their functioning are incompatible with the necessity to safeguard national unity.
.Accordingly, the following are prohibited and considered as illegal organisations: the Ranquil Confederation, the United Confederation of Peasant Workers, the National Federation of Metallurgical Unions, the Occupational Union of Construction Workers of Santiago, the National",-1,1975,Chile
320,"Union of Textile and Clothing Workers, the Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Construction Workers and the Industrial National Federation of Mineworkers. The organisations are dissolved and their legal personality removed. The same applies to their affiliates. Their assets are transferred to the State.
.Whatever the reasons invoked by the Government in the legislative decree dissolving these organisations, the Committee must point out that the procedure followed in these cases for the dissolution of these organisations is not compatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be dissolved by administrative authority. The measures taken are of a particularly serious nature since affiliated organisations are also affected under the legislative decree, and their assets transferred to the state (article  of the decree). Accordingly, the Committee would request the Government to provide, as soon as possible, its observations on this aspect of the case.IV. Civil liberties relevant to the exercise of trade union rights
.In its previous report the Government had stated that the state of siege had not been prolonged on  March . The country was thus governed by the provisions relating to a state of emergency, which were more flexible than those providing for a state of siege. The Government had also stated that it hoped that it would be possible for the restrictions associated with the state of emergency to be eliminated to the extent practicable within the near future. The government authorities had stressed to the representative of the Director-General the importance which should be attached to the amnesty granted in accordance with Decree No.  of  April .
.At its June  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted with interest the measures taken by the Government, especially as regards the amnesty, and expressed the hope that other measures would be adopted, as soon as possible, in order to fully establish the exercise of civil rights, thus permitting the return to a normal trade union situation.
.As regards the allegations concerning the detention or the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, the Committee, in May , regretted that it had been unable to note from the information supplied by the Government that any progress had been made as regards the supply of the information expected concerning the persons mentioned in the present case who were said to have been detained or who had disappeared. Furthermore, the Committee noted the contradictions between the statements made by the Government and those made by the complainants who had supplied various details concerning the detention of numerous trade unionists or former trade unionists who had subsequently disappeared. The Committee also noted that a number of habeas corpus applications were being dealt with by the courts concerning persons who had disappeared and that the authorities would inform the ILO as to the full scope of these judicial procedures. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to continue its investigations in order to trace the missing persons and to transmit information on the results of the judicial proceedings that were taking place.
.In its report dated  October  the Government provides information on  out of the  persons named in the latest list established by the Committee while noting this information the Committee wishes to request the Government to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on this list.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the adoption of new trade union legislation, to note that this legislation is nearing completion and to express the hope that the Committee will be able to examine this at its next session, and that it will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association;(b) as regards collective bargaining, to express the hope that the Government, in restoring collective bargaining, will take account of the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee at its previous session concerning compulsory arbitration for collective disputes;(c) as regards the allegations concerning collective labour disputes, to note that the Committee will make a more detailed examination, at its next session, of the information provided by the Government on this matter;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the trade union elections, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above; and to request it to transmit information concerning the reasons for fixing certain cases of ineligibility in the legislative decree on elections;(e) as regards the allegations relative to the removal from office or dismissal of trade union leaders, to note that the Committee will, at its next session, examine the text of the judgement in the cases of Juan Fincheira, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz;(f) as regards the allegations concerning the dissolution of trade union organisations, to point out that the procedure followed in these cases was incompatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be dissolved by administrative authority, and to request the Government to provide its observations on this question as soon as possible;(g) as regards the allegations concerning the detention or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, to note the information provided by the Government and to request it to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on the latest list established by the Committee in its th Report; and(h) to take note of this interim report.
.The last report submitted by the Government of Chile under article  of the ILO Constitution on the measures taken to comply with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission was examined by the Committee and the Governing Body at their November  session.,
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At that session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, and to submit a report on this subject by  April .The Government supplied this report in a communication dated  March .Additional information was provided by the Government in communications dated  and  April .
.Following consultations between the Government of Chile and the Director-General it was decided to have recourse to the direct contacts procedure. The Director-General appointed Mr. Luis Segovia, official of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him on this mission. Interviews were held between  and  May .
.In the course of his mission, the representative of the Director-General met with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, the Secretary of State and the Adviser for International Affairs of this Ministry. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Justice, and the Secretary of State for the interior. He was also able to have interviews with a number of former ministers of labour. In the premises of the trade unions he met workers' leaders who belonged to various trends in the trade union world. Finally, at the headquarters of the Confederation for Production and Commerce he met with the president of this central employers' organisation and with the leaders of affiliated organisations which cover a number of branches of activity including agriculture, commerce and construction.
.The representative of the Director-General was afforded all the necessary facilities by the authorities. During his interviews with the authorities and with the employers' and workers' leaders great interest was demonstrated by all of them in the direct contacts mission, and they expressed the hope that this mission could make a contribution to the normalisation of the trade union situation in the country. On various occasions, the representative of the Director-General was told of the importance which all attached to the procedures applied by the ILO in trade union matters and especially to the work done by the competent ILO bodies as regards the trade union problems which had arisen in the country.
.The Committee has examined the evolution of the trade union situation in Chile as well as the questions before it in Case No. , taking account of the information supplied by the representative of the Director-General which has been of great use to it in the performance of its task.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) the Government of Chile has transmitted a further report on the evolution of the situation as regards the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association;(b) to note that the promulgation of the new legislation on trade unions, which is still being prepared, is provided for in the process of evolution of the trade union situation, but to point out to the Government that one of its priorities should be the repeal of Decree-Law No.  and the promulgation, as soon as possible, of legislation in conformity with the principles",2,1975,Chile
321,"of the ILO;(c) to note with interest the Government's announcement of a return shortly to collective bargaining and to draw its attention to the principles and considerations set out in paragraph  above concerning the right to strike;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs - above concerning trade union organisations in the agricultural sector and to invite it, in particular, to adopt appropriate measures to facilitate the financing of federations and Confederations in this sector;(e) to note the information concerning the situation of FENATEX and FIEMC and to request the Government once again to provide information on the possible presence of a representative of the Ministry of Education on the Executive Committee of ANESE,(f) to note with interest the measures taken by the Government, especially as regards the amnesty, and to express the hope that other measures will be adopted, as soon as possible, in order to fully re-establish the exercise of civil rights, thus permitting the return to a normal trade union situation;(g) to request the Government to continue to send information on the evolution of the trade union situation as regards the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation commission and to transmit a report thereon by  October .
.The Committee last examined this case at its February  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined the case the Committee has received communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions ( March ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April ) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( April ). The Government, for its part, sent information in a communication dated  March .
.In addition, during his direct contacts mission to Chile, Mr. Segovia, the representative of the Director-General, obtained information on the various matters still outstanding in the present case.
.In February  the Committee expressed its regret that the Government's recent communications contained no information with respect to the many persons named by the complainants as having been arrested or as having disappeared, whereas the Committee had hoped to obtain particulars, inter alia, as to the results of the further investigations undertaken by the Supreme Court into the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials. The Government had stated, however, that it would supply all the available information by  April . On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body, accordingly, urged the Government to supply particulars of the inquiries made into the situation of the persons named in a list drawn up by the Committee.
.As concerns three persons who, according to the WFTU, had been temporarily arrested (Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros and Ramn Velasquez), the Government had denied the allegations made and declared that these persons had never been arrested. The Governing Body decided, in March , to bring the Government's reply to the attention of the complainants. Lastly, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to forward its observations concerning the arrest of Juan Montecinos, the caretaker at the headquarters of the National Federation of Metalworkers' Unions, who was alleged to have been kept in custody for six hours and severely tortured.
.In its communication of  March , the Government again states that in cases where trade unionists have been arrested, this was not due to their trade union activities but because of their involvement in partisan agitation, sometimes under cover of so-called trade union action.
.With regard to the persons who are said to have disappeared, the Government states that the law courts are now dealing with the actions brought in this connection. The procedure is in two stages: the preliminary investigation, which is conducted in private, and the court proceedings, when judgement is pronounced. The courts, which are quite independent from the Government, may not divulge what was revealed in confidence during the preliminary investigation until the case is closed either by a final judgement or by the dismissal of the case. Proceedings have been initiated in respect of each of the actions brought. In a large number of cases it has been established that many of the persons concerned were at home, some of them not even aware that they had been reported missing. Other persons presumed missing had been arrested under the State Security Act and then released, whereupon they returned to work. Another group is now abroad, and one person is in prison for fraud and bigamy. A number of persons have been found to have several aliases and identity documents. Some are not registered with the Identity Bureau.
.With regard to the complaints presented to the ILO, the Government states that, of the  cases mentioned over all these years, explanations have been given by the Government in  of them showing clearly the falseness of the accusations made. Before the change of regime, between  and  persons disappeared every year. According to United Nations statistics, the yearly figures for missing persons run into thousands in certain countries. The Government claims that it has always offered the fullest collaboration in the investigations undertaken. It mentions three factors which should not be overlooked in an impartial analysis of this question. Under the former regime, identity papers were forged on a vast scale for political and electoral purposes, so that many of the persons reported missing never really existed. Following the change of regime, numerous operations were carried out with a view to preventing the spread of hotbeds of internal subversion. These clashes resulted in the disappearance of certain persons. The Government remarks, in this connection, that the number of reports of missing persons is declining steadily and rapidly in so far as it, has become possible to restore order and security in the country. Lastly, in the Government's opinion, it is no exaggeration to assume that, in the campaign being waged against Chile, recourse may be had to the invention of further disappearances in order to keep the debate on Chile in the limelight.
.The Government has not supplied information concerning the arrest of Juan Martecinos, caretaker of the local trade union branch of the FENSIMET.
.During the direct contacts mission information was published in the press concerning the arrest of persons who were said to have committed crimes against the legislation on internal security, but in the course of the interviews with the trade union leaders of various trends no mention was made to the representative of the Director-General of actual or recent cases of arrest for trade union activities except for those which had taken place during the events of  May which are examined later in this present document.
.As regards the list of persons in respect of whom the Committee had requested information in its th Report, the Government supplied the following details to the representative of the Director-General. The person appearing in this list under the name of Pedro Abel Barria A. was probably Pedro Felix Argel Vera who was detained in Chin Chin Prison and who was amnestied by Decree Law No.  of  April .The Government has no information in respect of the following persons: Jos Bacza Cruces, Jorge Caceres Gonzalez, Gabriel Castillo Tapia, Carlos Contreras Maleye, Jose Corvalan Valencia, Juan Cortez Abruiz, Lenin Diaz Silva, Humberto Fuentes Rodriguez, Mario Fuica Vega, Maria Gutierrez Ramirez, Joel Huaniquir Penairdes, Fernando Lara Rojas, Victor Macaya Molina, Guillermo Martinez Quijon, Bario Miranda Godoy, Juan Moraga Garces, Miguel Morales Ramirez, Miguel Nazal Quiroz, Rodolfo Nunez Benairdes, Juan Orellana Catalan, Luis Recabarren Gonzalez, Manuel Recabarren Rojas, Anabal Ripeulme Pino, Jorge Salgado Salinas, Pedro Silva Busto, Jorge Solovera Garrado, Luis Vega Ramirez, Carlos Vizcarra Cofre, Jose Weibel Navarrette and Ricardo Weibel. As for the other cases, the Government refers to the information supplied to the ILO in its communication.
.As regards one of the procedures that had been set in motion concerning the disappearance of a number of persons, the Minister of Justice pointed out that the judge of the Court of Appeal of Santiago, who had been appointed to deal with this matter, went to the customs office known as ""Abanzada de los Libertadores"" at the frontier between Chile and Argentina where he was able to confirm from the records that Horacio Cepeda Marinkovic and Luis Lazo Santander had crossed over to Argentina on  January , that Lisandro Cruz Diaz had done likewise on  January  and that Lincoyan Berrios Cataldo had also done so on  December . According to this information the departure from the country of these persons did not meet with any obstacles since no action on the part of the Government or of the courts prevented them from going abroad and in order to cross this frontier an identity card was all that was necessary.
.It was pointed out to the representative of the Director-General that the courts were dealing with a number of habeas corpus applications concerning persons who had disappeared. There was a certain doubt as to the effect which the measure of amnesty decreed by the Government could have on the subsequent",1,1975,Chile
322,"judicial proceedings. Some lawyers publicly expressed the opinion that the inquiries through the courts should continue since, if this was not done, it would not be possible to know whether or not there existed any facts which could be covered by the amnesty. In any event, the authorities pointed out that they would make inquiries as to the actual state of the procedures concerning the persons mentioned in the report of the Committee on Freedom of Association and inform the ILO of the result.
.The Committee regrets that it is unable to note from the information supplied by the Government that any progress has been made as regards the supply of the information expected concerning the persons mentioned in the present case who are said to have been detained or who have disappeared and who appear on the list annexed to the Committees th Report. The Committee cannot fail to note the contradictions between the statements made by the Government and those made by the complainants who have supplied various details concerning the detention of numerous trade unionists or former trade unionists who have subsequently disappeared.
.The Committee notes that a number of habeas corpus applications are presently being dealt with by the courts concerning persons who have disappeared and that the authorities will inform the ILO as to the full scope of these judicial procedures. In the opinion of the Committee, whatever the scope of the amnesty which has been decreed, the amnesty itself should not prevent further inquiries being made to clarify the situation of these persons.
.The complainants had referred to the assignment to forced residence of the following trade union officials: Georgina Aceituno, Juan Sepulveda, Hernn Mery and Samuel Astorga. The Government had stated that these measures had been taken by virtue of the special powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Legislative Decree No.  of , which were subject to the control of the courts. In the case in question the court of Appeal of Santiago, seized of an appeal, had confirmed the measures taken, but ruled that the Government should not have fixed the place of residence of those persons in the province to which they were assigned. They themselves had the right to choose their place of residence within that province.
.At its session in February-March , the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to state the precise reasons for which measures of assignment had been taken against these persons.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that the persons concerned were set completely free on  March  and their transfer to Arica was brought to an end. The Government points out that the measure taken with respect to these persons was a transfer from one province to another, which is not a penal sanction and should not be confused with the penalty of assignment to forced residence imposed by the law courts as a punishment for an offence. The persons mentioned in the complaint had been transferred to the north of the country after being caught attending a meeting deemed to be clandestine under the terms of the State Security Act and the Legislative Decree on the dissolution of political parties, inasmuch as officials and former members of parliament belonging to dissolved political parties were also present. According to the Government, there was no question of its being a trade union meeting.
.During the direct contacts mission the Secretary of State for the Interior confirmed to the representative of the Director-General that recourse to this measure of transfer, which had already been repealed, had been necessitated as a result of the participation by the persons concerned in a political meeting that had been organised in a church. The Secretary of State indicated that he would endeavour to obtain further information on the facts of the matter. It was not possible for the representative of the Director-General to obtain this further information before his departure from Chile.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the participation of the persons concerned in a political meeting was the reason for the measures of transfer that were taken by the Government. In any event, having regard to the fact that these persons are now free, the Committee considers that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.With regard to the trade union officials who had been deprived of their nationality - Luis Meneses, General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT), and Humberto Elgueta and Ernesto Araneda, members of the External Committee of the CUT - the Government had stated that these persons, who were living abroad, had behaved in an unpatriotic manner. Such an attitude was punishable under the Chilean Constitution by loss of nationality, and the Government had no alternative but to enforce this provision. One of the persons in question, Mr. Elgueta, had availed himself of the opportunity open to him to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court, which had declared the measure taken against him to be null and void.
.On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body, in February-March , noted with interest the rescinding of the measure taken against Mr. Elgueta and suggested to the Government, bearing in mind the decision taken by the Supreme Court, the possibility of reconsidering, with respect to the other two persons named by the complainants, the extremely serious deprivation of rights to which they had been subjected.
.In its communication of  March , the Government repeats the information already provided for the Committee's last session. It adds that as far as it knows, Mr. Meneses and Mr. Araneda have not lodged an appeal.
.From the information supplied by the President of the Supreme Court and the Minister of Justice during the direct contacts mission, it seems that the revoking of the measure taken concerning persons who have not lodged an appeal with the courts would require a new legislative provision of the Government. In addition, as a result of the coming to an end of the state of siege, the penalty of deprivation of nationality cannot be imposed by the Executive.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It suggests that the Government, in the spirit in which the amnesty was recently granted, re-examine the measure which affects Mr. Meneses and Mr. Araneda.
.At its February  session the Committee examined complaints relating to the assignment to forced residence in the north of the country on  November  of seven trade unionists, including three copper workers' leaders (Milton Puga, Director of the El Teniente Copper Salaried Employees' Union; Juan Fincheira, President of the Copper Salaried Employees' Union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellano, Director of the Copper Manual workers' Union). According to the Government, these officials had been assigned to forced residence ""for having engaged in political agitation in the trade union field and organised acts of indiscipline at work completely incompatible with national security"". According to the complainants, however, they had been victimised for exercising their trade union rights. Later the Government had stated that the officials in question had been freed on  December  and had returned to their homes.
.In its communication of  March , the WFTU states that the three officials mentioned in the preceding paragraph have been forced to resign from their trade union office by order of the military government of the province. They have been replaced in their functions by decree, and in addition they have been dismissed from their jobs.
.In its communication of  April  the CLAT refers to the removal from office by decree of two trade union leaders of the National Confederation of Bank Associations of the State of Chile, namely the Chairman, Andres del Capo Hamel, and its Vice-President, Arturo Moreno Patino. This decree is based on article  of the Decree Law No.  as amended by the Decree Laws Nos.  and  which permit the intendant of a province to demand the resignation of trade union leaders of those organisations at which these decree laws are directed. The reasons given show that within the executive of this organisation there existed divergences of opinion which prevented it from functioning properly.
.The CLAT points out that on  January  the intendant of the fifth region adopted a resolution which obliged the president of the National Federation of Port Workers of Chile, Mr. Carlos Frez Rojo, to hand in his resignation as leader of this organisation within  hours. Thereafter he was stripped of his functions as president by a decree dated  January . This trade union leader had to change his place of work and for this purpose he was sent to the extreme north of the country.
.Mention is also made in the communications of the WFTU and the ICFTU of the fact that by Resolution No.  dated  March  of the Ministry of Labour four new trade union leaders were appointed in order to make",1,1975,Chile
323,"up the executive body of the National Federation of Maritime workers following the removal from office of the leader Domingo Sanchez Nunez.
.The information supplied to the representative of the Director-General during the direct contacts mission confirms that Juan Finchiera, Milton Puga and Carlos Arellano, leaders of the Occupational Union of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente, as well as Arturo Latuz, Director of the Occupational Union of Caletones were transferred from their place of residence by an order made in November  by the Ministry of the Interior. Articles in the press indicate that at that time there had been a labour stoppage, or certain of the workers of El Teniente had absented themselves, in order to support their occupational claims. This measure of transfer was lifted on  December  and, according to the persons concerned, they were notified that an end had been put to their labour contracts as soon as they returned home. The undertaking invoked reasons which were directly linked to the measure of transfer. It seems that the undertaking had recourse to one of the reasons for dismissal introduced in the legislation by Decree Law No.  of , namely the participation in illegal acts provoking the absence of workers. In this case the prior authorisation of the courts is not necessary in order to dismiss trade union leaders. The persons concerned appealed to the labour courts and the matter is being dealt with at present. As a result of their loss of employment the persons concerned have automatically lost their trade union responsibilities and they have been replaced by new trade union leaders by virtue of the procedure provided for by Decree Law No. .On  April  the persons concerned requested in writing the intervention of the Minister of the Interior with a view to their reinstatement in their employment and in their trade union offices.
.The Committee notes that the question of the dismissal of the trade union leaders Juan Fincheria, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz is presently being examined by the labour courts. As regards the loss of trade union office following dismissal the Committee has always considered that national legislation which lays down that all trade union leaders must belong to the occupation in which the organisation functions may jeopardise the exercise of trade union rights. In fact, as is shown in the present case, the laying off of a worker who is a trade union leader can, as well as making him forfeit his position as a trade union official, affect the freedom of action of the organisation and its right to freely elect its representatives and even encourage acts of interference by employers. The Committee considers that the Government, which rapidly lifted the measure of transfer taken against the trade union leaders in question, should intervene so that they may be reinstated in their employment and in their trade union functions. Moreover, the persons concerned remain officials of the bank.
.As regards the trade union leaders Andres del Campo and Antonio Moreno, President and Vice-President of the National Confederation of Hank Associations of the State of Chile, the information gathered by the representative of the Director-General shows that these two trade unionists were elected before December . In December  they were removed from office by the intendant of Santiago on the basis of the provisions of Decree Law No.  of . This decree law, as modified, authorises intendants to request the resignation, and accordingly the removal from office, of trade union leaders from various types of organisations, amongst which are associations of employees or officials in the public sector, when there are serious reasons which justify such a measure being taken. In the case of these two trade union leaders the authority which took the measure referred to the existence of serious ""divergences"" amongst the members of the executive of the trade union. In a letter dated  April  addressed to the President of the Republic by a group of trade union leaders it is pointed out that the members who were still exercising executive office in the Confederation had, however, pointed out to the intendant that this supposed divergence did not exist.
.The representative of the Director-General confirmed that Carlos Frez Rojo, President of the National Federation of Port Workers, was also removed from trade union office by virtue of the provisions of Decree Law No. . Mr. Frez Rojo had been one of the seven trade union leaders transferred to Arica in November , a measure which was lifted in December. The preamble to the decree removing them from office indicates that trade union leaders must see to it that the interests of the workers are safeguarded in the work centres. Mr. Frez Rojo, however, had engaged in activities which had nothing to do with his trade union. The person concerned has not been dismissed from the state enterprise where he works but he has been transferred to the port of Arica where he is at present. The Ministry of the Interior pointed out to the representative of the Director-General that Mr. Frez Rojo had been engaged in political activities in Santiago.
.Finally, as regards Mr. Domingo Sanchez Nunez, leader of a trade union at Talcahuano, affiliated to the Federation of Occupational Unions of Port Employees, it was pointed out to the representative of the Director-General that this person had been called upon by the Federation to fill a vacancy in the executive bodies. Having proceeded thus, the Federation was acting in conformity with Decree Law No.  which provides for the automatic grant of a post falling vacant in the executive body of a federation to the leader of an affiliated organisation who possesses the greatest seniority in the job. Subsequently, however, the labour authorities on the basis of another provision of Decree Law No.  which provides that the seniority rule does not have to be applied ""in cases where by reason of special circumstances it is not possible to apply the provisions of the decree law"" appointed four leaders of primary organisations instead of recognising the appointment of Mr. Sanchez Nunez. These four trade union leaders had just been appointed in their own unions. With the appointment of Mr. Sanchez Nunez the minimum number of trade union leaders laid down by Decree Law No.  was reached. Following the appointment by the Ministry of the four new trade union leaders, all the seats on the executive of the Federation were taken up.
.This question is presently the subject of an appeal for protection lodged with the courts by the Federation. According to the President of the Supreme Court this kind of appeal permitted the courts to examine administrative measures of this type.
.The Committee considers that all these cases relating to trade union leaders in the banking and maritime sectors point to the existence of discretionary intervention on the part of the administrative authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions. The possibility open to the administrative authorities to remove trade unionists from office or to appoint trade unionists can leave the way open to all kinds of abuse and is consequently incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee has already pointed out in other cases that the removal from office of trade union leaders in case of breach of the law or of the by-laws of a union do not become enforceable except on the basis of a firm sentence on the part of the competent judicial authority or in any case after the period allowed for the submission of an appeal has elapsed without such an appeal having been made.
.The Committee considers that the Government should re-examine the measures taken with a view to the trade union leaders concerned being able to resume their trade union functions.
.The WFTU, in a telegram dated  May  points out that the authorities violently broke up a demonstration organised on  May. According to the WFTU  persons were arrested and treated violently on that occasion.
.It appears from the information gathered by the representative of the Director-General that the trade union leaders of a large number of trade union organisations who wished to celebrate  May , presented to the Ministry of the Interior one month in advance a request for authorisation to hold a public meeting in Santiago. The programme was to consist of a speech by a trade union leader and some artistic performances. On  April the organisation was notified that this meeting had not been authorised and that the only demonstration provided for in Santiago on this occasion would take place at the government buildings in the presence of the President of the Republic. All those interested were publicly invited to attend this demonstration in which numerous trade union leaders would participate.
.It was announced in the press that the organisers of the meeting which had not been authorised would turn up at the place chosen in order to inform those invited that the meeting had been",-1,1975,Chile
324,"suspended. The police intervened to break up the meeting of the persons who had gathered. As regards this matter the Secretary of State for the Interior pointed out that a minimum principle of authority necessitated an intervention in a reunion which had not been authorised. He also emphasised that the police had acted moderately and in a correct manner. Some  people, amongst whom was the trade union leader for the railway sector, Ernesto Vogel, were arrested for an identity and residence check. They were all released the same day without having been interrogated even if some of them are being charged before the local police court for breach of the peace in addition, some of the demonstrators held a meeting in a church whence they withdrew peacefully without any intervention on the part of the police. The leaders of  trade union organisations issued a tract to the workers in which they examined various aspects of the social and trade union situation and in which it is indicated that authorisation to hold a meeting on the occasion of  May had been refused for the fifth year running.
.The Committee notes that the persons arrested on the occasion of the demonstration organised on  May were immediately released. It must however express its regret at the fact that the Government did not authorise a meeting requested by a large number of trade union leaders. In fact, as the Committee has already indicated as regards the prohibition of a meeting which certain trade union organisations wished to organise on  May , trade unions should have the right to freely organise meetings which they wish on the occasion of Labour Day provided that they respect the measures taken by the authorities to ensure public order.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the detention or the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists:(i) to regret that the information provided by the Government does not permit it to note that any progress has been made as to the supply of information on the persons in question and to request the Government to continue its investigations in order that these persons might be traced;(ii) to request the Government to transmit information on the results of the judicial proceedings that are taking place regarding these persons;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the transfer of some trade unionists, to note that all the trade unionists concerned have regained their freedom, and to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing further its examination of this aspect of the case;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union leaders in exile, to suggest to the Government that it should, in the spirit of the amnesty that has recently been decreed, re-examine the measure which affects Mr. Meneses and Mr. Araneda;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the measures affecting certain trade union leaders:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  concerning the obligation on trade union leaders to belong to the occupation represented by their organisation and the removal from office of trade union leaders by administrative authority;(ii) to request the Government to intervene with a view to the reinstatement of those concerned in their trade union functions and, in the case of dismissal, in their employment;(iii) to request the Government to transmit the text of the judgement to be handed down in the case of Mr. Juan Fincheira, Mr. Milton Paga, Mr. Carlos Arellano and Mr. Arturo Latuz.(e) with regard to the allegations concerning the events which took place on  May, to note that the persons arrested have been released, but to express its regret that the Government did not authorise a meeting requested by a large number of trade union leaders, and to stress that trade unions should have the right to freely hold meetings which they wish on the occasion of Labour Day provided that they respect public order;(f) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee examined this case in February, May and November  and in February, May and November . It submitted an interim report at each of these sessions.
.Since it last examined the case the Committee has received a number of communications from complainant organisations: one (dated  November ) from the World Federation of Trade Unions, three (dated  November and  December  and  January ) from the World Confederation of Labour, one (dated  November ) from the Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Building Materials Workers (FIEMC), one (dated  November ) from the National Federation of Metalworkers' Unions (FENSIMET), one (dated  December ) from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), and one (dated  December ) from the Trade unions international of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries (UIBWM).
.These allegations were transmitted to the Government as and when they were received. The Government has supplied information in letters dated  December ,  and  January and  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In reply to the allegations made earlier, the Government had supplied certain information, and had stated on several occasions that nobody was or had been under arrest on account of his status as a trade unionist or his trade union activities, but for breaches of the law or for reasons of public order.
.In November  the Committee noted with deep regret that the Government had not supplied any new information concerning the alleged arrest or disappearance of the many persons named in the complaints. The Committee had, however, been informed that following the submission of new evidence to substantiate the claim that these persons had been arrested, the Supreme Court had decided to reopen the inquiry into, in particular, the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials named in these complaints.
.The Committee expressed the hope that the investigations would be carried out diligently and in full independence. More generally, as concerns all the allegations of disappearances, the Committee urged the Government to carry out thorough inquiries into these cases, in respect of most of which the complainants had supplied additional information, including eye-witness accounts, to substantiate their claim that the persons in question had been arrested.
.The Committee further noted with regret that the recommendations for the continuance of the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn did not appear to have been complied with. The Committee considered that the witnesses' testimony compiled by the Ad Hoc Working Group established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the organization of American States sufficed to show the need for reopening the inquiry into this matter and continuing it until the person or persons responsible were found.
.The Government had likewise failed to reply to the allegations concerning the temporary arrest of certain trade union officials: Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros Morales and Ramn Velasquez.
.On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body, inter alia, requested the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons named in the list annexed to the th Report. It requested that the competent authorities continue the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, and asked the Government to forward as speedily as possible its comments on the arrest of the persons named in paragraph  above.
.The FENSIMET subsequently alleged, in its letter of  November , that the caretaker of its union headquarters, Juan Montecinos Montecinos, had been kept in custody for six hours. The persons who arrested him had produced no warrant for his arrest, and he had allegedly been severely tortured. The complainant organisation had filed a protest with the Ministry of the Interior; an inquiry had been ordered, but it had not yet been discovered who was responsible for the torturing.
.As concerns the persons alleged to have disappeared, the Government stated in its letter of  January  that the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare had set up, jointly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a co-ordination Committee for the collation of evidence, since most of the names mentioned also appeared in similar complaints filed with other international organisations. All the available information would be sent with the report requested for  April .
.With regard to the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Government repeated that the Valparaiso courts had undertaken an inquiry and had adjourned the case on  February , in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. No new evidence had come to light and the case had not been reopened.
.The Government denied that Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros and Ramn Velasquez had ever been arrested; the first named was not and",1,1975,Chile
325,"had never been, according to the Government, a trade union official; he had been a Member of Parliament until .
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government concerning the three persons named in the preceding paragraph, but observes that it is in complete contradiction with the allegations referring to their arrest.
.The Committee draws the attention of the complainant organisations to this reply.
.Furthermore, the Government has not yet replied to the allegations concerning the temporary arrest of the caretaker of the FENSIMET's headquarters and the ill-treatment he is said to have suffered.
.As concerns the circumstances of the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Committee had previously drawn attention to certain discrepancies between the Government's statements and the evidence taken from various witnesses, and had recommended that the inquiry be continued.
.The Committee is bound to observe that this recommendation has not been acted upon, and it deplores the fact that, as a result, it is impossible for it to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts on such a serious aspect of this case.
.The Committee further regrets that the Government's recent communications contain no information with respect to the many persons named by the complainants as having been arrested or disappeared, whereas the Committee had hoped to obtain particulars, inter alia, as to the results of the further investigations undertaken by the Supreme Court into the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials. More generally, the Government had been requested to carry out thorough inquiries into the cases of disappearance. But the Government's reply is that it will supply all the available information by  April .
.The Committee appends to this report a list of the persons in respect of whom information - or further information - has been requested from the Government but not yet supplied, and urges the Government to supply detailed particulars as to the situation of these persons.
.Several trade union organisations (WFTU, WCL, FIEMC, FENSIMET, CLAT and UIBWM) have referred to the arrest and subsequent assignment to forced residence of the following seven trade union officials: Carlos Frez Rojo, President of the National Port Workers' Federation and the Unitarian Workers' Front; Arturo Latuz Favi, Director of the Copper Manual Workers' Union (""El Teniente"" Mine); Milton Puga, Director of the Copper Salaried Employees' Union (""El Teniente"" Mine); Juan Fincheira, President of the Copper Salaried Employees' Union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Juan Manuel Sepulveda, Vice-President of the FENSIMET; Carlos Arellano, Director of the Copper Manual Workers' Union, and Hctor Hugo Cuevas Salvador, PRESIDENT of the FIEMC. According to the Government, they have been assigned to forced residence ""for having engaged in political agitation in the trade union field and organised acts of indiscipline at work completely incompatible with national security"". According to the complainants, these persons have been victimised for exercising trade union rights, although their activities formed part of their trade union duties as representatives of their organisations and of the workers, and their demands related to conditions of work.
.The complainants have drawn attention to the plunge in the purchasing power of wages and the blatant inadequacy of the adjustments granted on the ground of inflation. They have also referred to arbitrary dismissals, unfair treatment by employers, lack of freedom to organise, hold meetings, elect representatives in full freedom, submit pay claims, negotiate improved conditions and go on strike, and the problem of unemployment in town and country. Petitions addressed to the Government by trade union organisations, they continued, had gone unanswered, and requests to see officials had been refused; on the contrary, the unions were accused of engaging in politics and behaving unpatriotically.
.According to these organisations, the banished union officials were merely doing their duty and endeavouring to carry out faithfully the mandate given to them by the workers; they did not organise any work stoppages nor engage in subversive activities; while there may have been a few instances of indiscipline at work, they arose out of problems still unsolved. The complainants added that it was not by banishing, nor imprisoning, nor threatening people that these problems could be solved.
.The complainants went on to state that the workers at the ""El Teniente"" Mine, those at the port of Valparaiso, building workers, metalworkers and others had been seeking wage increases. Immediately following the El Teniente miners' strike  workers had been dismissed. The complainants pointed out that the trade unionists assigned to forced residence had been separated from their families and deprived of means of subsistence and medical supplies in an inhospitable region subject to extremes in temperature in the north of the country. In conclusion, one of the complainant organisations requested that a representative of the Director-General be sent to Chile as a matter of urgency.
.In several communications the Government stated that the trade union officials mentioned in paragraph  had been assigned on  November  to forced residence in towns in the north of the country for breaches of the legal provisions in force. They had been freed on  December  by Decree No.  of  December  (of which the Government supplies a copy), issued by the Ministry of the Interior, and returned to their homes.
.The Committee notes with interest the release of these persons. It observes, however, that the penalty of assignment to forced residence was imposed on them without any judicial proceedings having been initiated against them, and that the Government has not specified the offences of which they were accused.
.As the Committee has already had occasion to point out in earlier cases, although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the absence of guarantees of due process of law may lead to abuses and allow trade union officials to be penalised pursuant to decisions based on groundless accusations. It may also create a climate of insecurity and fear which may be prejudicial to the exercise of trade union rights.
.In a more recent communication (dated  January ), the WCL referred to the assignment to forced residence of the following trade unionists: Georgina Aceituno, Juan Sepulveda, Hernn Mery and Samuel Astorga.
.In its communication of  February the Government states that these measures of assignment were taken by virtue of the special powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Decree No.  of , in conformity with the Constitution of . They do not amount to penal sanctions. The powers thus conferred on the President of the Republic are subject to the control of the courts. The Court of Appeal of Santiago has been seized of appeals lodged by persons affected. The court confirmed the powers of the President and the measures taken. The court, however, decided that the Government should not have fixed the place of residence of those persons in the province to which they were assigned. They themselves had the right to choose their place of residence within that province. All the persons concerned had chosen to settle in Arica.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government concerning this matter. It notes, however, that the Government does not state the precise reason for which the measures in question were taken. The Committee would like to request the Government to provide information in this connection.
.The WFTU had alleged that a number of trade union officials had been harassed in connection with their activities on the occasion of May Day . These officials, who had signed a document entitled ""Analysis and Aspirations of Chilean Workers after  Months of Military Government"" (submitted to the Government on May Day), stated that after that date ""overt, illegal and abusive pressure"" had been brought to bear on the leaders who had associated themselves with this document. Submissions under the amparo procedure had been filed by some officials whose organisations were signatories to the document; they had been followed by vehicles and by persons in civilian clothes; the premises of their organisations or their homes were being kept under surveillance; some of them had received a series of anonymous telephone calls. The WFTU mentioned the names of the following officials: Hctor Hugo Cuevas Salvador, Fernando Bobadilla Pisani, Ricardo Celedonio Lecaros Gonzlez and Sergio de Jests Villalobos.
.The WFTU also referred to the Government's refusal to allow the celebration of May Day  to be organised by  trade union organisations.
.In the absence of any reply from the Government concerning these various allegations, the Governing Body requested it in November  to forward its comments on these matters as speedily as possible.
.In its letter of  January , the Government stated that the trade union organisations had celebrated May Day in  with a combined mass demonstration in which the most important Chilean Confederations, federations, associations and unions had taken part.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied fuller information on these aspects of the case. It wishes to emphasise that the holding of public meetings and the voicing of demands",1,1975,Chile
326,"of a social and economic nature are traditional forms of trade union action on the occasion of May Day. Trade unions should have the right to organise freely whatever meetings they wish to celebrate May Day, provided that they respect the arrangements made by the authorities to ensure the keeping of the peace.
.The ICFTU and the WFTU alleged in communications of May  that the Government had deprived of their nationality Messrs. Luis Meneses, General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT), and Humberto Elgueta and Ernesto Araneda, members of the External Committee of the CUT. As the Government had not yet furnished its observations on this matter, the Governing Body requested it in November  to forward its comments on this grave act.
.The Government stated in its communication of  January  that the persons concerned - who were living abroad - had behaved in an unpatriotic manner. They had launched a campaign among the international community designed to isolate Chile and bring down its Government. The Government added that they had levelled slanderous charges at the highest governmental and military authorities; this attitude had been manifested in communications, signed by them and containing unfounded accusations, insults and calumnies, addressed to various international bodies to encourage them to suspend loans, cancel agreements, etc. Such an attitude, continued the Government, was severely damaging to the essential interests of the State and was punishable under article () of the Chilean Constitution by loss of nationality. The Government could not do other than enforce this provision, having regard to national security, development and the country's safety, and had issued Decree No.  (published in the official Gazette on  May ), which was perfectly legal and received the assent of all the Ministers of State.
.The Government went on to state that Legislative Decree No.  of  allowed a person affected by such a measure to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court within  days of its publication. Mr. Elgueta had adopted this procedure, and the Court, by  votes to , had declared the above-mentioned decree to be null and void as far as the appellant was concerned. The Government, bowing to this decision, had issued Presidential Decree No,  of  December  (published in the Official Gazette on  December ), rescinding the measure taken against Mr. Elgueta. This proved, continued the Government, that the judicial power was entirely independent from the executive power. As for Messrs. Meneses and Araneda, the reasons which compelled the authorities to impose this severe penalty under the Constitution still subsisted.
.The Committee notes with interest that the measure taken against Mr. Elgueta has been revoked following an appeal to the Supreme Court. Bearing in mind the decision taken by this judicial body, the Government may wish to reconsider the extremely serious deprivation of rights to which Messrs. Meneses and Araneda have also been subjected.
.The WFTU and the WCL had alleged in January  that an armed group had raided the premises of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEF), and that the Vice-President of this organisation had been brutally assaulted on this occasion. The Government had stated that criminal proceedings had been initiated in this case and that the Minister of the Interior had requested the Director-General of the Investigation Service to ensure that the inquiries reached a satisfactory conclusion as speedily as possible. No further information having been received from the Government by November , the Committee expressed its regret that this was so and emphasised that a climate of violence - symptomised by acts such as this - might constitute serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and that such occurrences called for severe measures on the part of the authorities.
.In its communication of  January  the Government repeated the information summarised above. It added that the ANEF had been carrying on its activities normally at its headquarters and in the rest of the country, its leaders travelling continually within the country as well as going abroad to participate in events of all kinds.
.The Committee notes this last information.
.Within a more general context, the Committee has been informed that consultations are taking place between the Director-General and the Government of Chile with a view to having recourse to the direct contacts procedure in the near future.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists:(i) to express its regret that the Government has supplied no further information with respect to the many persons named by the complainants as having been arrested or disappeared, and to urge the Government to supply particulars of the inquiries made into the situation of the persons named in the list annexed to the present case;(ii) to note that the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn has not been continued despite the recommendations of the Committee and the Governing Body, which were formulated on the basis of new facts which had arisen, and to deplore the fact that it is therefore impossible for the Committee to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts on a matter of such seriousness;(iii) to note that, according to the Government, Messrs. Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berrios and Ramn Velasquez were not arrested, to bring this reply to the attention of the complainants, and to request the Government to forward its observations concerning the arrest of Juan Montecinos;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the assignment of trade unionists to forced residence:(i) to note with interest the release of seven trade union officials assigned to forced residence in November ;(ii) to note, however, that the Government has not specified the offences of which they were accused, and to draw its attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraph  with respect to guarantees of due process of law;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the precise reasons for which measures of assignment were taken against the persons mentioned in paragraph  above;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the bringing of pressure to bear on trade union leaders and the refusal to allow certain trade union organisations to celebrate May Day, to draw the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph , and to emphasise in particular that the holding of peaceful meetings and the voicing of demands of a social and economic nature are traditional forms of trade union action on the occasion of May Day;(d) with regard to the allegations concerning the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union officials in exile, to note with interest the rescinding of the measure taken against one of these officials following an appeal to the Supreme Court, and to suggest to the Government, bearing in mind the decision taken by this judicial body, the possibility of reconsidering with respect to the other two persons named by the complainants the extremely serious deprivation of rights to which they have been subjected;(e) to note that consultations are taking place with a view to having recourse to the direct contacts procedure in the near future;(f) to take note of this interim report.
.In pursuance of the resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile adopted by the international Labour Conference at its th Session (June ), and following requests from the Governing Body, the Government submitted four reports under article  of the ILO Constitution on the measures taken to comply with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, whose final report had been accepted by the Government. The first of these reports was examined by the Governing Body during its th Session (November ). The others were the subject of reports by the Committee which were respectively approved by the Governing Body at its th, st and rd Sessions (May , November  and May ).
.In paragraph  of its st Report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, and to submit a report on this subject by  October . The Government submitted this report in a communication dated  September .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May ), the Government of Chile has submitted a further report on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on freedom of Association;(b) to express once more its deep concern at the slowness in adapting new trade union legislation and to urge the Government to repeal Legislative Decree No. , and to promulgate without",0,1975,Chile
327,"delay legislation guaranteeing the free exercise of trade union rights;(c) to request the Government to provide information on the functioning of tripartite Committees and to state what measures are being taken or envisaged to ensure greater freedom in collective bargaining; and to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraph  above;(d) to request the Government to furnish the information requested in paragraphs ,  and  concerning, respectively, the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants, the FENATEX and the FIEMC, and the ANESE;(e) to note with interest the Government's communication to the effect that the persons placed at the disposal of the executive authorities, and as such detained under the powers conferred under the state of siege provisions, have now been released;(f) to note also that the allegations relating to the arrest or disappearance of certain serving or former trade union officials are being examined within the context of Case No. ;(g) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, and to submit a report on this subject by  April .
.The Committee has already examined this case in February, May and November  and in February and May . It submitted an interim report at each of these sessions.
.Just before the May  Session, and since that session, the office received a number of communications from the following complaining organisations bearing the dates indicated hereafter: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May ); World Federation of Trade Unions ( May,  June,  July and  September ); Trade Unions International of chemical, oil and Allied Workers ( July ). These communications were transmitted to the Government for its observations. The Government supplied information in a communication dated  September .
.The allegations at issue concern the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and pressure exerted upon trade union officials, the raiding of trade union premises, the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union leaders in exile and refusal to allow certain trade union organisations to celebrate May Day.
.The complainants had communicated the names of numerous serving or former trade union officials who had been arrested or who had disappeared. The Government had supplied information concerning several of the persons named by the complainants. It had also stated on several occasions that nobody was or had been under arrest on account of his status as a trade unionist or his trade union activities, but for breaches of the law or for reasons of public order.
.At its May  Session, the Committee recommended the Governing Body:(i) to note that some of the persons mentioned by the complainants as having disappeared were at liberty in the country; others, however, had left the country;(ii) to remind the Government that it had not yet transmitted information on a large number of persons;(iii) to urge the Government to continue its investigations into the disappearance of the trade unionists in respect of whom it stated that it had no information, and to request it to communicate the findings, and to request the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons listed in the annex to the present case;(iv) to request the Government to allow the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn to be pursued with the greatest care and objectivity, and to communicate the findings of the inquiry.
.In a telegram dated  May , the WFTU referred to a communication from the External Committee of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT) alleging the arrest by the National Intelligence Department (DINA), in March , of Juan Eduardo Berros Morales, an official of the Chilean Confederation of Employees in the Private Sector (CEPCH). This trade union official was said to have been arrested at his home at dawn. He was beaten up and taken, blindfold, to a building where he remained for about  hours, being tortured and interrogated. He was subsequently freed at a spot near his home, to which he was authorised to go after being threatened that he and his family would be killed if he revealed what had happened to him. A case had been filed in this respect with the Santiago courts under the amparo procedure.
.In its communication of  June , the WFTU referred to the interrogation by the DINA on  June  of two trade union officials, Samuel Astorga and Ramn Velasquez, at Pudahuel Airport on their return from Caracas, where they had attended a trade union meeting. In a later communication from the WFTU it was stated that the persons who had carried out the interrogation identified themselves as security agents. The documents these trade union officials had with them were seized.
.The WFTU appended to its communication of  July  a document explaining the different forms of arrests made in Chile. In some cases the period in custody is very short. The persons concerned are arrested at their homes or in the streets and taken to interrogation centres, where they are tortured. They are freed after a few hours or a few days. They are enjoined not to reveal what has happened to the judicial authorities or to the Church. In some cases, the persons in question are forced to continue to collaborate with the security services. Other arrests are followed by disappearance. Lastly, some persons, a few days after their arrest by the security services, are placed at the disposal of the competent military or ordinary court, whereupon they are transferred to a public prison.
.The document sent by the WFTU also stated that a number of trade union officials had been molested as part of an attempt to create a general climate of fear among the workers' representatives. These incidents were said to be connected with the activities of these officials on the occasion of May Day. The trade union leaders who had signed a document entitled ""Analysis and aspirations of the Chilean workers after  months of military government"", which was submitted to the Government on May Day, stated in a communication addressed to the Archbishop of Santiago that subsequently ""overt, illegal and abusive pressure"" had been brought to bear on the trade union leaders who had associated themselves with this document.
.The communication from the WFTU went on to refer to a number of amparo submissions filed by trade union leaders as a result of acts directed against them personally. The persons concerned: Hector Hugo Cuevas Salvador, President of the Industrial Federation of Building, Woodworking and Building Materials Workers; Fernando Bobadilla Pisani, President of the National Textile and Clothing Workers' Federation; Ricardo Celedonio Lecaros Gonzlez, President of the National Federation of Iron and Steel and Metalworking Industrial Unions; Sergio de Jess Villalobos, President of the Ranquil Confederation. All these leaders, whose organisations had all been signatories to the document submitted to the Government on May Day, were subsequently followed by vehicles and persons in civilian clothes. The premises of their organisations or their homes were kept under surveillance, and some of them received a series of anonymous telephone calls.
.In its communication of  July , the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers alleged that Carlos Contreras Maluje, a member of the single National Union of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratory Workers, was arrested in October  by the DINA. He was injured at the time of his arrest, and since then nothing more had been heard of him.
.The WFTU's communication of  September  contained additional information about serving and former trade union officials whose arrest or disappearance had been mentioned in earlier complaints. This complaint also contained new allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance between  and  of  serving or former trade union officials who were not named in earlier complaints. This information and these allegations were communicated to the Government for its observations. Appended to this communication was a list of  other persons who did not have the status of trade union officials but who, according to the complainants, were arrested and then disappeared because they were members of a trade union, and had engaged in legitimate trade union activities before or after the change of regime. The dates of these arrests were spread over the period from September  to August . The Committee requests the complainants to supply particulars as to the trade union membership and activities of the persons in question.
.In its communication of  September , the Government supplied some information about persons named in the annexes to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission's report in respect of whom the Committee had requested information as to their present circumstances. The persons whose names follow are at liberty after serving sentences of imprisonment or forced residence: Jaime Aros Cruz, Alfonso Carreo Diaz, Juan Elpidio Gonzlez, Edgardo Lobos Flores, Guillermo Mardones Campos, Rolando Oato Zambrano, Isabel Peiford, Osvaldo Tello Gomez. Another person, Hernn Venegas Cutio, is serving a prison",1,1975,Chile
328,"sentence of three years and a day for forging sales documents.
.As concerns the persons mentioned in the complaints relating to the present case, the Government repeated that most of these persons had not been arrested and had in all probability disappeared of their own volition, going underground after receiving instructions to that effect. It added that disappearances like these took place in accordance with organised plans for which the Government could not be held responsible.
.With regard.to the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Government repeated the information already communicated in its previous report to the effect that the Valparaiso criminal court had undertaken an inquiry into the matter. The investigations had been suspended by the court on  February  ""until further information comes to light"".
.The Committee must note with deep regret that the Government has not supplied any new information concerning the alleged arrest or disappearance of the many persons named in the complaints relating to the present case. The Committee has, however, been informed that following the submission of new evidence to substantiate the claim that these persons were arrested, the Supreme Court has decided to reopen the inquiry into, in particular, the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials named in those complaints which have come before the Committee. The Committee expresses the hope that the resumed investigations with respect to these persons will be carried out diligently and in full independence. More generally, as concerns all the allegations of disappearances that have been brought to its attention, the Committee urges the Government to carry out thorough inquiries into these cases, in respect of most of which the complainants have supplied additional information, including eye-witness accounts, to substantiate their claim that the persons in question were arrested.
.The Government has likewise failed to reply to the allegations made since the Committee's last session concerning the temporary arrest of certain trade union officials (Eduardo Berrios Morales, Samuel Astorga and Ramn Velasquez) and attempts to intimidate others (Hector Hugo Cuevas Salvador, Fernando Bobadilla Pisani, Ricardo Celedonio Lecaros Gonzlez and Sergio de Jess Villalobos) and concerning the detention of Carlos Contreras Maluje. The Committee would like to have the Government's observations on these allegations.
.The Committee further notes with regret that the recommendations for the continuance of the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn do not appear to have been complied with. The Committee considers that the witnesses' testimony compiled by the Ad Hoc Working Group established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organisation of American States' suffices to show the need for reopening the inquiry into this matter and continuing it until the person or persons responsible are found.
.The WFTU and the WCL had alleged that an armed group had raided the premises of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEF). The complainant organisations added that the Vice-President of the ANEF, Milenka Mikovilovic, had been brutally assaulted on this occasion.
.The Government had stated that criminal proceedings had been initiated in this case in the courts of Santiago. In addition, the Minister of the Interior had requested the Director-General of the Investigation Service to ensure that the inquiries reached a satisfactory conclusion as speedily as possible.
.At its May  Session the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to intensify the investigations into the case and to communicate the findings.
.In its report of  September , the Government repeats the information already provided in its previous reports.
.The Committee regrets that no new information has been provided on this matter. It emphasises that a climate of violence, symptomised by acts such as that committed against the premises of the ANEF, may constitute serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights and that such occurrences call for severe measures on the part of the authorities.
.In its communication of  May , the ICFTU stated that the Government had deprived of their nationality Messrs. Luis Meneses, General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT), and Humberto Elgueta and Ernesto Araneda, members of the External Committee of the CUT. The WFTU made the same allegations in a telegram dated  May .
.The Government has not yet furnished its observations on this matter.
.The Committee wishes to request the Government to forward its comments as speedily as possible concerning these allegations, and concerning, in particular, the reasons which prompted the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from the trade union officials in question.
.In its telegram of  May , the WFTU referred to the Government's refusal to authorise the celebration of May Day as requested by.  trade union organisations.
.The Government has not yet furnished its observations on this matter.
.In general terms, the Committee recalls that the right to organise public meetings on the occasion of May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights. The Committee wishes to request the Government for its comments on these allegations.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that other persons named in the report of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission have been released;(b) to note, however, with deep regret that the Government has not supplied any new information concerning the alleged arrest or disappearance of the many persons named more recently by the complainants;(c) to request the Government once again to carry out thorough inquiries into the cases of disappearance and to supply information on the situation of the persons named in the list annexed to the present case;(d) to request the Government to ask the competent authorities to continue the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Roman with a view to finding the person or persons responsible;(e) to draw the Government's attention to the observations made in paragraph  above concerning the raiding of the premises of the ANEF;(f) to request the Government to forward as speedily as possible its comments on such a grave act as the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union officials in exile;(g) to request the Government also to forward as speedily as possible its comments on the allegations relating to the temporary arrest of Messrs. Eduardo Berrios, Samuel Astorga and Ramn Velasquez, the attempts to intimidate Messrs. Hector Cuevas; Fernando Bobadilla, Ricardo Lecaros and Sergio de Jess Villalobos, and the refusal to authorise the celebration of May Day by certain trade union organisations;(h) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ), the Government of Chile has submitted a further report on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association;(b) to urge the Government to promulgate as soon as possible new trade union legislation, thereby giving effect to its stated intention to do so, and to repeal Legislative Decree No.  in order to ensure the normal functioning of trade union activities;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above with respect to trade union elections;(d) to note with interest the changes contemplated in the system of tripartite Committees, and to express the hope that they will constitute a step towards the full re-establishment of free collective bargaining;(e) to remind the Government that the Committee still requires information concerning the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants in order to be able to assess the present situation of these organisations, as well as information concerning the measures taken to grant legal personality to the FIEMC and the FENATEX.(f) to request the Government to supply information on the situation of the ANESE;(g) with regard to the questions relating to human rights, to note that the allegations referring to the arrest or disappearance of certain persons are being examined within the context of Case No. ;(h) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and to submit a report on this subject by  October .

.The allegations outstanding concern the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, the financing of agricultural trade union organisations and the raiding of trade union premises.
.In these circumstances, and regarding the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists:(i) to note that some of the persons mentioned by the complainants as having disappeared are at liberty in the country; others, however, have left the country;(ii) to remind the Government that it has not yet transmitted information on a large number of persons;(iii) to",1,1975,Chile

.The Committee already examined this case in February, May and November . At each of these sessions it submitted an interim report.
.The allegations still outstanding in this case concern the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and the financing of agricultural trade union organisations. In addition, further allegations have been made concerning a raid on premises belonging to a trade union.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists(i) to note the information supplied by the Government particularly as concerns the release of most of the persons about whom it has furnished information;(ii) to note, however, that the Government has not supplied any information about many of the persons on the lists forwarded to it since the Committee's last session;(iii) to express once again its concern as regards the allegations that trade unionists have disappeared after being arrested, at the same time noting that several of the persons mentioned by the complainants as having disappeared have, according to information supplied by the Government, left the country, to request the Government to indicate whether further investigations are being made into the cases of other persons alleged to have disappeared, and, if so, to communicate the findings;(iv) to note that a judicial inquiry is being conducted into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, and to request the Government to communicate its findings;(v) to request the Government to take the necessary steps to communicate all the information still awaited by  April ;(vi) to point out that the forced exile of trade unionists cannot be considered to be equivalent to release since it is not only in violation of human rights but also in violation of the principles of freedom of association, particularly when it deprives trade union organisations of their freely elected leaders;(b) as regards the financing of agricultural trade union organisationsto draw the Government's attention to the remarks made in paragraph  above and to express the hope that the Government will continue seeking ways of offsetting the loss of resources suffered by the workers' agricultural organisations and, in particular, ways of facilitating the collection of trade union dues;(c) as regards the raid on the premises of the ANEFto note that criminal proceedings have been initiated in this connection and to request the Government to communicate the findings as soon as they are made known;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.Under these conditions the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Government of Chile submitted a further report on  September  relating to the evolution of the situation as regards the recommendations by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association and the resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile, adopted by the Conference at its th Session ();(b) to note the adoption of new Constitutional provisions concerning trade union rights, but to renew its appeal to the Government to promulgate as soon as possible new trade union legislation conforming fully with the recommendations made by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations with regard to collective bargaining set out in paragraph  above and to point out once again that an important objective of the Government should be to restore the practice of collective bargaining as soon as possible;(d) to note with interest the winding up of the labour coordination Committees and to express the hope that the new administrative institutions and structures will make it possible to promote relations between the public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations, and between the latter;(e) to deplore the lack of information from the Government on the conditions under which the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants are undertaking their trade union activities and to request the Government once again to supply information on the situation with regard to these two organisations;(f) to point out to the Government that it would be useful if it could take all possible measures to solve the difficulties encountered by the FIEMC and FENATEX in obtaining legal personality;(g) to note with interest the adoption by the Government of Constitutional provisions protecting certain basic human rights;(h) to recall the great importance which it attaches to the effective application of the Decrees of  January and  February  concerning the protection of detainees;(i) to request the Government to continue submitting information on the evolution of the situation with regard to the recommendations made by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and to submit a report on this subject by  April .
.The Committee already examined this case in February and May  and, at each of these sessions, submitted an interim report.
.The allegations made in the various complaints relate to the arrest or disappearance of serving or former trade union leaders, annulment of the legal personality of teachers' associations and the financing of agricultural trade union organisations.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance of serving and former trade unionists,(i) to note with interest that several of the arrested trade unionists have been released, but to remind the Government once again that arrest by the authorities of trade unionists regarding whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may seriously restrict freedom of association;(ii) to note that some of the persons mentioned by the complainants are still under arrest without having been brought before courts, and to point out that an arrested trade unionist should be brought before the competent judge as soon as possible, this constituting one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to fully safeguard the exercise of trade union rights;(iii) to regret that, despite repeated requests by the Governing Body, the Government has not mentioned the precise facts which could have led to the detention of some of the persons arrested under the state of emergency regulations;(iv) to express its concern regarding the allegations that trade unionists have disappeared following arrest, and to request the Government to undertake new investigations regarding the persons mentioned in - paragraph  above, in respect of whom the Government states that it has no information, and to communicate the results as soon as possible;(v) to note that certain persons who were allegedly arrested have left the country;(vi) to request the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons mentioned in paragraph  above;(b) regarding the allegations concerning annulment of the personality of certain teachers' associations, to take note of the considerations set out in paragraph  above;(c) regarding the allegations concerning the financing of agricultural trade union organisations, to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above and to invite it to seek, together with workers' and employers' agricultural organisations, ways of compensating for the loss of funds suffered by the agricultural unions;(d) to note this interim report, it being understand that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the information requested above.Geneva,  November .

.In its consideration of Case No. , the Committee examined a series of allegations on infringements of trade union rights and submitted two reports on the matter to the Governing Body which are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and  to  of its nd Report. At its rd Session (May-June ), the Governing Body decided to refer the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Committee on Freedom of Association, whose final report was accepted by the Government. This report was considered by the Governing Body at its th Session in May .At its th Session in June , the International Labour conference adopted a resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile. In accordance with this resolution and at the request of the Governing Body, the Government, pursuant to article  of the Constitution of the ILO, submitted a report on  October  on the steps taken to implement the recommendations of the Committee.
.At its th session in November , the aforementioned Government's report was placed before the Governing Body which instructed the Director-General to ask the Government, again in accordance with article  of the Constitution, to report by  April  on developments in the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association and the Conference resolution. According to this decision, this report should deal in particular with the matters on which the Government has not yet supplied information, including satisfactory answers on certain points (re-election of trade union representatives; the right to collective bargaining; certain specific trade union matters with regard to the restoration of trade union assets, the grant of legal personality to certain organisations, the takeover of two organisations, the normalisation of the financial situation and resumption of activities of specific organisations of rural workers and the avoidance of discrimination between trade union organisations; the dismissal of trade union officials; and points relating to the arrest and trial of trade unionists). In the same decision, the Governing Body requested the Committee on Freedom of Association to examine the report of the Government and submit a report to the Governing Body at its th Session. The Government sent its report on  April .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). The Government's report now before the Committee was also requested by the Governing Body pursuant to article  of the Constitution in connection with these instruments.
.With regard to the matters examined as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile adopted by the Conference at th Session () and the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), the Government of Chile has sent a report, based on article  of the Constitution, on the development of the situation in respect of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association relating to the case of Chile and the Conference resolution;(b) to urge the Government to adopt without delay trade union legislation conforming to the principles of freedom of association and to end the restrictions on trade union activities which are currently in force;(c) to note that the Government has increased the number of advisory Committees on remuneration, and to point out that an important objective of the Government should be to restore the practice of collective bargaining as soon as possible;(d) to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the observance of the recommendation of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, to the effect that the labour coordination Committees should be converted into tripartite advisory bodies, as described in paragraph  above;(e) as regards the situation of certain trade union organisations:(i) to note with interest that the Government has issued legislative provisions concerning the payment to agricultural workers' organisations of the funds to which they are entitled, but, at the same time to point out that the position of the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants has not been clarified and the Government has not provided any information on the points referred to in paragraph  above;(ii) to note that the Government has not complied with the Commission's recommendation with regard to the ending of the takeover by the Government of the Single Union of Workers in Education (SUTE); that no information has been provided on the position of the National Association of Education Service Employees (ANESE); that the law authorising the staff of the ministry of Education to exercise trade union activities has been repealed and that the legal personality of the SUTE has been revoked, in contravention of the principles of freedom of association and of the Commission's recommendation that the new trade union legislation should recognise the right of workers, including public servants, to establish organisations",-1,1973,Chile
332,"of their own choosing;(iii) to draw attention to the need for the Government to send specific information on the action taken in respect of the Commission's recommendations regarding the organisations referred to in paragraph  above, relating to the problems mentioned in the same paragraph;(f) to note that the Government has not complied with the Commission's recommendation regarding the reconsideration of certain dismissals of trade union leaders and to draw the Government's attention to the contents of paragraphs  and  above;(g) bearing in mind the relation between fundamental human rights and the exercise of trade union rights, to note with interest the Decrees of  January and  February  and other measures referred to in paragraphs  and  above designed to ensure the protection of the rights of detainees in the country; and to stress the importance which it attaches to the effective application of these legal provisions;(h) to draw the Government's attention, nevertheless, to its concern about the detention of persons, including trade unionists, without being brought to trial and about the fact that certain trade unionists were released only on condition that they leave the country;(i) in accordance with the provisions of the Conference resolution and the decisions of the Governing Body, to request the Director-General to communicate this report to the International Labour Conference at its st Session; andj) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the development of the situation, especially as regards the matters on which it has not yet furnished information, and to transmit, by  October , a report in this regard.
.The Committee examined the present case at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body found at paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was adopted by the Governing Body at its st Session in November . (See also paragraph  below.)
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It will be recalled that the allegations made by several trade union organisations concerned in particular the arrest of many trade union leaders and the dissolution, by the Government, of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUTCH).
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a communication addressed to the ILO on  September . The WFTU formulated new allegations in two subsequent communications dated  September and  October . The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries is contained in a communication dated  September . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent its complaint to the ILO in a communication dated  September . The complaint of the Latin American Central of Workers is contained in three communications dated ,  and  September . This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour. The International Metalworkers' Federation addressed its complaint to the ILO on  September , and the complaint of the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers is contained in a communication dated  September . The Trade Unions International of Workers in Commerce forwarded its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees forwarded its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The Miners' Trade Unions International sent its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The complaints of the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers are contained in communications dated ,  and  October  respectively.
.In its communication of  September , the World Federation of Trade Unions refers to the arrest of numerous trade union leaders, and expresses fear for the lives of Luis Figueroa, Rolando Caldern, Ernesto Vogel, Eduardo Rojas, Octavio Gonzlez, Luis Guzmn, Fidelma Allende, Manuel Dinamarca, Mario Navarro, Aldo Romachiotti, Tucapel Jimnez, Jorge Godoy, Juan Ponce, Gilberto Garcia, in particular, all leaders of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, and of Jorge Espinoza, Roberto Prieto and Benedicto Cerqueira, of the Secretariat of the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity.
.In its communication dated  September  the Latin American Central of workers (CLAT) asks that, faced with the situation in which Chilean workers at present find themselves and in order to save the lives of numerous workers, militants and trade union leaders, the ILO should send a mission to Chile. The CLAT states that the Government is infringing all the rights of the workers and their organisations and is organising a violent campaign of repression against them as well as against the Latin American trade unionists who have found refuge in Chile. It requests the ILO to intervene with the Chilean Government in order to re-establish trade union freedoms and rights. In a subsequent communication, dated  February , the CLAT repeats its request that a mission be sent.
.In their respective communications, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building Wood and Building Materials Industries, the International Metalworkers' Federation, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied industries workers, the Trade Unions International of Workers in Commerce, the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees, the Miners' Trade Unions International, the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers, and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers allege that numerous trade union leaders have been imprisoned or are being actively sought by the military authorities and that trade union rights are being violated or that they have no news of several trade union leaders. These complainants request the ILO to intervene in order to free the trade union leaders and ensure the respect of trade union rights.
.In its second communication, dated  September , the World Federation of Trade Unions states that it has been informed of the arrest of Roberto Prieto, a Uruguayan trade unionist, Secretary of the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin America and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco and Allied Industries Workers and expresses its grave anxiety for the fate of Benedicto Cerqueira and Jorge Espinoza, leaders of the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity, of whom it has no news. The WFTU states in its letter of  October  that the President of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, Luis Figueroa, is sought by the authorities, and adds that a reward of , escudos is offered to any person giving information of his whereabouts.
.In their respective communications, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the International Metalworkers' Federation, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees and the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers condemn the dissolution of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers by the Chilean Government. The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees and the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers state that their member organisations in Chile have been dissolved. The Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers indicates that the organisation affiliated with it in Chile has had its activities banned arbitrarily.
.An answer from the Government was received in November , at a time when the Committee was already sitting.
.The Government's reply under which the change of political rgime came about in Chile and the reasons for such a change. The Government states in particular that under the previous Government, state control of the economy was characterised by systematic persecution of workers and trade union leaders who did not share the Government's ideology. In the State-run undertakings, Marxist trade union leaders had become ""informers"" for the new management, serving interests contrary to those they pretended to represent. Legitimate strikes, such as that of the El Teniente miners, were repressed with unprecedented violence.
.As regards the allegations relating to the dissolution of the CUTCH, the Government notes that measures were taken to cancel the legal personality of the Single Central Organisation of Workers, because it had been proved to be a political instrument and not a union, and to serve interests contrary to those of the workers. Its unrepresentative character, its declaration of principles, in which it proposed the establishment of Marxist-Leninism in Chile, the gerrymandered election of its national executive to the detriment of the democratic majority, its constant perfidy to the workers' cause during the last three years, and its entire dependence on the state-employer, prejudicial to the interests of its members left no choice, the Government claims, but to cancel its legal existence. One fact in itself is alleged to demonstrate the total political dependence of the Single Central Organisation of Workers.",1,1973,Chile
333,"The Act recognising its legal existence (Act No. ) provides in section  that social aims can under no circumstances be ""connected with party politics or be electoral"". Yet, the Government continues, this trade union organisation was of such a political nature and its activities controlled by the Government to such an extent, that of the four Labour Ministers who sat in Senior Allende's Cabinet, three were officers of the Single Central Organisation of Workers. Two of them exchanged the functions of minister of Labour and Social Affairs and of President of the Single Central Organisation of Workers.
.As regards the allegations relating to the imprisonment of trade union leaders, the Government states that no trade union leaders have been imprisoned or actively sought as has been stated to the ILO and that basic human rights have not been violated. The Government states that a few extremists were also union leaders and had engaged in acts of violence such as sabotage, illegal possession of weapons, armed resistance to police officers and illegal trafficking on the black market in goods often coming from the premises where they worked and that they must answer for such acts in a court of law like any criminal at any period in the history of Chile. All these persons are being tried by the courts in accordance with due legal process and the provisions that have been in force in Chile for many years. Some others have sought asylum in the embassies of foreign countries thus proving, according to the Government, their participation in criminal acts. The Government adds that the political circumstances of Chile are those of civil war, which forces it to adopt certain legal restrictions of a temporary and exceptional nature that will be repealed once peaceful civil conditions are re-established through the disarming of guerrilla forces and a one-man executive is elected freely and democratically. All collective bargaining has been suspended until December .
.In an appendix the Government refers to the persons mentioned by name in the complaints and states that three of them, Luis Figueroa Mazuela, Fidelma Allende and Benedicto Cerqueira de Silva, are refugees in embassies and that one of them, Rolando Caldern, is detained on Dawson Island and that proceedings have been commenced against him. Further, the Government notes that none of the other persons mentioned in the complaint of the WFTU are being detained.
.The Government concludes by stating that the allegations submitted have not been proved by the complainants. It adds that there has been no anti-union persecution and that those imprisoned are being brought to justice in accordance with procedures established before the commission of the alleged offences. Finally, according to the Government, human rights have been respected at all times.
.The Committee experienced particular difficulty in dealing with this case because the Government's reply had reached it after the commencement of its session. In these circumstances it was not able to examine the substance of the issues placed before it nor could it reach any final conclusions. The Committee was perfectly aware of the serious situation which surrounded the case under its consideration. It pointed out in this respect that in cases where it considered complaints concerning alleged infringements of trade union rights committed under a state of emergency or a state of siege or under the terms of an internal security Act, it had always expressed the opinion that it was not competent to come to a decision on the need or the advisability of such legislation, which was a question purely political in character, but that it should consider the repercussions which such legislation might have on the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee proposed to examine the case thoroughly at its next session, taking into account any new supplementary information which might be transmitted by either the complainants or the Government.
.As a preliminary measure, however, the Committee recommended the Governing Body at paragraph  of its th Report:""(a) to express its concern at the gravity of the allegations posed in the various complaints with respect to which it has just received a reply from the Government;""(b) without at present coming to a conclusion as to the substance of the complainants' allegations, to call the attention of the Government(i) to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority;(ii) to the importance which it attaches to the principle of a fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary and if possible by the regular courts, in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions;""(c) to request the Government to transmit any supplementary information which it may obtain on the latest developments concerning the situation of the several persons mentioned in the complaints about whom it has already supplied certain information; and""(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a new report to the Governing Body at its next session, taking into account any supplementary information which may be transmitted by either the complainants or the Government.""
.The Governing Body approved these recommendations in considering the Committee's th Report at its st Session (November ), and instructed the Director-General to ask the Government of Chile whether, should the Governing Body decide to refer the complaint to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, the Government would be willing to agree to its being so referred. This was brought to the Government's notice in a communication dated  November . The Government was requested to be good enough to take the necessary steps to ensure that the information requested in paragraph  of the th Report, together with its reply respecting the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission be sent as quickly as possible.
.Other complaints have been received since the Committee's session in November  and have been transmitted to the Government upon receipt.
.The International Metalworkers' Federation, in support of its complaint, sent in two further communications, one dated  November and the other  December . Five communications were received from the World Federation of Trade Unions - one dated  November, another two  November, and two more on  January and  February . The Miners' Trade Unions International, the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries and thee World Confederation of Labour sent in communications dated  November,  December and  December , respectively.
.In its two additional communications, the International Metalworkers' Federation urges that an immediate stop be put to breaches of Convention no.  committed by the Government of Chile. The complainants quote three enactments: Order , which abolishes the right to be absent on union business and the right to receive wages in respect of time required in order to appear on summons before the authorities, and suspends all submission of claims; Decree  repealing protection from dismissal for all those who were or might become leaders of strikes or work stoppages or who prevented or might prevent workers from working; Decree  suspending all agreements relating to wages, benefits and other remuneration and all automatic readjustment of pensions. The IMF encloses the text of these enactments in its letter of  December .
.The World Federation of Trade Unions, in its communication dated  November , declares that Lina Benitez, alias Lina Kleovan, leader of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, has been condemned to death.
.The WFTU, in its communication dated  November, vigorously protests against the execution of David Miranda, General Secretary of the Chilean Miners' Federation (shot on  October), and denounces the dismissals and arrests of strikers. The Miners' Trade Unions International, in its letter dated  November, declares that Miranda was shot with twenty-five companions, having been arrested immediately after the coup d'tat and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. This organisation expresses the gravest misgivings about the fate of many leading figures in the Chilean Miners' Federation and Chilean Copper Miners' Confederation.
.The Latin-American Federation of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, in its communication of  December , says that its Chilean member-organisation, the Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, is unable to hold meetings and that most of its leaders are in custody.
.The World Confederation of Labour, in its letter dated  December, expresses keen apprehension at the continued widespread repression in Chile, entailing very serious breaches of trade union and human rights. There is no justification for maintaining a ""state of civil war"" in the opinion of the WCL. Political and trade union prisoners are not assured of the minimum guarantees of a fair trial or of being able to exercise properly their right to be defended in the normal way.
.The WCL goes on to say that public servants at all levels have had imposed on them a total ban on joining and",-1,1973,Chile
334,"taking an active part in trade unions. It also draws attention to the distressing situation of the trade union leaders who have sought refuge in foreign embassies in Santiago and to whom the authorities refuse to grant the safe-conducts without which they cannot leave. Finally, the WCL draws attention to the Government's intention to transform the labour movement into a tool of the rgime through the establishment of trade unions dedicated to its support.
.In its letter of  January  the WFTU alleges that the Chilean authorities have sacked trade union premises and abolished the rights of assembly, organisation, petition and strike. The WFTU appends to its communication a copy of Circular No.  from the minister of the Interior, which lays down that trade union meetings shall take place only after prior authorisation and in the presence of a member of the state police, and provides for the removal by administrative procedures of trade union leaders who are active in those parties which have been declared illegal.
.The WFTU submits a list of trade union officers said to have been executed. It names Ivn Gordillo, leader in the Antofagasta branch of the CUTCH; Almonacid, secretary of the O'Higgins branch of the CUTCH; Hctor Rojo, Samuel Nez, Armando Jimnez, Guillermo Alvarez, trade union leaders of the San Antonio stevedores; Isidoro Carrillo, Bernab Cabrera, Vladimir Araneda, coal workers at Lots; Luis Valdivia and Luis Mamani, union officers at Calama; Ricardo Garca, a worker who was acting as head of the ""Cobre-Sal"" mine, and five union leaders of this undertaking; Hctor Martnez Molina, agricultural workers' leader; and Manuel Donoso, a professor and teachers' leader in Arica. The WFTU adds that Lus Norabuena, CUTCH leader, would seem to have died as a result of beating by the military. Danile Vergara, a trade union leader, allegedly died on Dawson Island as a result of torture. Further, the WFTU states that the following trade union leaders, who have sought refuge in embassies, have been refused safe-conducts; Lus Figueroa, Rolando Caldern (wounded within the confines of an embassy and at present in a military hospital), Jorge Godoy, Fidelma Allende, Mireya Baltra, Hernn del Canto, Eduardo Rojas and Lus Guzmn. According to the WFTU thousands of workers are incarcerated in prisons and concentration camps. It names Lina Bentez, member of the Santiago Provincial Committee of the CUTCH and Lucila Lortsch, a leader of the Chilean University Office Workers' Association. Finally the WFTU states that many workers, estimated at about , have lost their jobs because of their trade union activities. In a subsequent communication, dated  February , the WFTU alleges that by reason of the strike of harbour workers in Puerto Montt, the trade union leader, Elpidio Gonzlez was taken into custody and is to be tried by a military tribunal on charges of sabotage and incitement to strike.
.In a communication dated  December , the Government comments on the WFTU's statement to the effect that Lina Bentez had been condemned to death. The Government denies the truth of this assertion, and states that Lina Bentez is in prison awaiting trial. In another communication, dated  December, the Government states that Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, formerly General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, is neither in prison nor being tried; he is in fact a refugee in a foreign embassy.
.The Government has sent two new communications dated  and  February . In the latter the Government replies in detail to the various allegations made by the complainants and sends a series of documents as evidence of its statements.
.The Government refers first of all to the situations of various persons mentioned in the complaints. Ernesto Vogel Ramrez and Aldo Ramaciotti Nolli declare that they have not been detained or interrogated by the new authorities. Tucapel Jimnez Alfaro states that he has not been disturbed either at home or at his work. Gilberto Garca Aravena says that he has been neither detained nor questioned about his activities in the CUTCH. Ernesto Vogel was Vice-President of the CUTCH and continues to be President of the Industrial Federation of Railways in Chile. Aldo Ramaciotti is a member of the Executive Council of the National Federation of Housing Workers. Tucapel Jimnez is a leader of the National Revenue Workers' Association and First Vice-President of the Interim Executive of the National Central Workers' Organisation, which was established in December .
.The Government goes on in its report to refer to the following persons: Jorge Godoy, formerly Minister of Labour, has sought asylum in the Swedish Embassy; Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, in whose regard the Government mistakenly stated that he was in custody on Dawson Island, has sought asylum in the Cuban Embassy, now under the protection of the Government of Sweden. He was wounded by a shot fired at close range within the confines of the Embassy. After being treated in the Military Hospital, he re-entered the Swedish Embassy. Eduardo Rojas Cuellar has not been sought by the police and is in the Finnish Embassy. Luis Guzmn Robinson has taken refuge in the Embassy of Argentina and since gone to that country. Fidelma Allende Miranda is in the Finnish Embassy. Roberto Prieto, a Uruguayan national, took refuge in the Swedish Embassy, and subsequently after his expulsion from Chile, went to Sweden. Benedicto Cergueira da Silva, a Brazilian, sought asylum in the Embassy of Panama and then went to that country. Lina Bentez alas Line Kleovan was detained for supposed criminal acts and then set free. Manuel Dinamarca Figueroa has been neither detained nor tried. Juan Ponce Ferrada has not been detained, having gone to Moscow on  June . Patricio Gonzlez Verdugo is entirely free. Lus Figueroa Mazuela is a refugee in the Swedish Embassy.
.The Government then refers to the situation of various trade union organisations mentioned in the complaints. The Government states that the Chilean Private Non-Manual Workers' Confederation, the Industrial Mining Federation, the Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the Revenue Workers' Association, the National Association of Municipal Workers, the National Health Service Professional and Technical Staff Union, the National Federation of Health Workers, the National Federation of Textile Workers and the National Leather and Footwear Workers' Federation, have their own executives and are functioning. The Chilean Copper Miners' Confederation gave itself a new national executive in December , on which the Communist, Socialist and Christian Democrat parties are represented. The ""Ranquil"" National Federation of Agricultural and Indigenous Workers has legal personality and full capacity to act in law. As regards the Single National Union of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratories and Related Branches (SUTRAL) the majority of organisers in this association have given up activities in it and the leaders of the unions which have formed the Single National Union are now attempting to revive the two existing federations of manual and non-manual laboratory workers.
.The Government replies to the allegation relating to the strike in the Santiago Underground and states that of the  workers dismissed,  were taken on again and  deprived of their jobs. Of the latter only one has appealed to the Courts.
.The Government goes on to refer to various allegations and charges concerning legislation enacted by the new authorities. The Government maintains that it is false to affirm that it has introduced the death penalty for the crime of going on strike. As regards the allegation concerning the increase in the working week by four hours (Decree No. ), the Government points out that this Decree stipulates that a full working week of  hours cannot be exceeded except in the cases provided for by legislation already existing, which are similar to those provided for in the Hours of Work (Industry) Convention,  (No. ), of the ILO. In any case the Decree was in effect only until  December . As regards order , which has been alleged to abolish the right to be absent from work for union affairs, the Government explains, quoting certain provisions of the Order, that employers are obliged to grant workers the leave necessary to carry out trade union functions outside the workplace, in accordance with the number of hours established in this text. It is up to the trade union organisation to make up the wages, etc., of the leaders who make use of this leave, unless by means of a collective agreement or contract it is provided that payment for this time is at the employer's cost. These provisions are temporary.
.As regards the allegation that Legislative Decree No.  has done away with protection for those who in the past have led or in the future will lead, illegal strikes or prevent workers from carrying out their duties, the Government quotes the provisions in question and asks whether it can be maintained that a worker who ""commits illegal acts which have prevented or prevent other workers from carrying out their jobs, or leads illegal interruptions in work"" is a worker who deserves to take continued advantage of his contract of employment.

335,"to the allegation that Legislative Decree No.  has suspended the application of all collective agreements relating to wages, benefits and other remuneration, and all automatic readjustment of pensions, the Government states that this order was only an interim measure, caused by the serious inflationary processes and chaotic situation in industry and the failure of the national economy. The Order suspended provisions concerning automatic readjustments. Subsequently various means were enacted pursuant to which bonuses and advances on readjustments of salaries and pensions were granted, and the establishment of tripartite Committees to study and suggest general frameworks of salaries and working conditions was laid down.
.The Government goes on to refer to Order No. , issued only a few days after the fall of the previous Government, and points out that in this document reference was made only to the dismissal of saboteurs, delinquents, extremists and agitators, pursuant to the provisions of the law. The same document also ordered, owing to the emergency situation which prevailed in the country, the suspension of some agencies such as the Conciliation Board and the Labour Arbitration Courts. These measures have been gradually becoming inoperative. Trade union activities have been suspended only in so far as they concern collective agreements, arbitration awards and similar matters while everything else carries on. At present , trade union organisations are in existence, with nearly , leaders. The only organisation which has wound up its activities is the Single Central Workers' Organisation (CUTCH).
.The Government also makes reference to the allegation concerning the prohibition of the right of assembly. In this regard it quotes provisions of the Internal State Security Act and the Constitution of the State, which authorise in exceptional cases the restriction of certain civil rights, including the right of assembly. The Government also quotes Legislative Decree No.  of  December , which is of an interim nature and permits only trade union meetings of an informative character or concerning the internal management of the organisations. The Government adds that these measures are becoming less rigidly applied and that in recent, weeks a number of meetings have taken place at which trade union problems have been discussed.
.The Government puts forward a series of comments concerning the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Committee's th Report. In the first place, as regards the dissolution of the CUTCH, the Government repeats the reasoning advanced in its first reply and then analyses the Act by which this and other trade union organisations had been granted legal personality. After stating its legal arguments, the Government points out that the object of this Act (No. ) was to grant legal personality only to this particular central trade union organisation, implicitly prohibiting the possible existence of any other central organisation. In this way, the Government states, Convention No.  and the Constitutional Reform Act of  were violated. The Government goes on to say that, once it is shown how the CUTCH obtained its legal personality through legislation to enter the service of a particular government, further legislation can legitimately dissolve its legal personality if the succeeding government has no need of this sort of political tool. The unions belonging to the CUTCH can form another Confederation. Several Confederations have already been formed since  September . Nevertheless it will not be possible to form again a trade union organisation whose legal personality is granted by law.
.As regards the principle expressed by the Governing Body according to which there should be a fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary and if possible by the regular courts in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences, the Government states that the legal traditions of the country will not be violated by the present Government. Chileans and non-Chileans alike have always been tried according to the legislation in force at the time of the commission of the offence and by courts already in existence at that time. The Code of Military Justice, which is being applied in certain cases, has been in force since  and in its present form since . The Code of Criminal Procedure, which is applied in other cases, has been in force for over  years and the Courts of Justice have been active for  years. The Government gives the example of three persons who were closely involved with the previous Government and who are being tried in the ordinary courts of law for their offences.
.Finally the Government states that it has disproved all the allegations and it requests that the complainants put forward be dismissed.
.In its communication of  February  the Government refers to the question put to it by the Governing Body, ""whether, should the Governing Body decide to refer the complaint to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, the Government would be willing to agree to its being so referred"".
.In reply to this question, the Government is of the opinion that in the hypothetical case where the Committee on Freedom of Association advised, and the Governing Body reached, the conclusion that it would be appropriate to refer the matter to the abovementioned Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, the Government would be able to reach an appropriate and precise decision on a concrete basis regarding its willingness to accept the referring of the matter only after examining, in the light of the corresponding report of the Committee and of any decision which the Governing Body may teach, the grounds in support of such a move and after analysing the application of the rules of procedure proper to the case.
.Just before the meeting of the Committee the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented a new communication dated  February . This communication describes the Chilean institutional order and the methods adopted by the authorities since  September , particularly as regards the unions, their functioning their dissolution, the situation of trade union leaders and other matters relating to civil rights. Two other communications were forwarded by the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers on  February , and received on  February. These contain allegations which refer in particular to the deaths and imprisonment of officers of the Single National Union of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratories and Related Branches (SUTRAL) and the Single Union of Workers in Plastics (SUTRAP). These three communications have not as yet been either transmitted to the Government or examined by the Committee. Further, on  February  the World Confederation of Labour also sent in a communication requesting that a commission of inquiry be sent to Chile.
.The Committee notes with interest the detailed information forwarded by the Government concerning various allegations made in the complaints, and in particular the situations of a number of union leaders and trade union organisations and the various legal texts enacted by the Government. It appears from this information that several of these leaders are at liberty, while others have sought asylum in embassies or have left the country, although it does not show why they have sought asylum, whether charges have been laid against them or whether there is any reason why they should not obtain a safe conduct. As regards the various trade union organisations mentioned by the Government, the information received does not show when and under what circumstances a number of them elected their executive Committees. In this connection it should be noted that Circular No.  of the Ministry of the Interior provides that trade union meetings can be held only with prior authorisation and in the presence of a member of the state police, that the mayor or governor is empowered to decide whether trade union Committees should resign, in whole or in part, that he may accept or refuse persons proposed to them by the organisations concerned, and that the Ministry of Labour will propose the means by which executive Committees which are active in outlawed political parties are to be replaced. Further, the Government has still not sent its observations concerning the shooting and death of various members and leaders of trade unions: David Miranda, Ivn Gordillo, Almonacid, Hctor Rojo, Samuel Nez, Armando Jimnez, Guillermo Alvarez, Isidoro Carrillo, Bernab Cabrera, Vladimir Araneda, Luis Valdivia, Luis Mamani, Ricardo Garcia and five union leaders of the Cobre-Sal mine, Hctor Martinez Molina, Manuel Donoso, Luis Norabuena and Danile Vergara. Other names figure in a communication just received.
.The Committee notes from the information available that the facts relating to the events mentioned in the complaints are very complex. Moreover, the allegations made raise serious issues, such as the imprisonment, asylum, and even execution, of trade unionists, restrictions on the right to organise, the dissolution of trade union organisations and restrictions on their activities, issues concerning which conflicting versions exist. A large part of the Chilean trade union movement seems to be affected, and recently fresh complaints have been lodged.
.In these circumstances, it would be highly desirable to be able to proceed with an impartial and deeper examination of",-1,1973,Chile
336,"the situation, which raises important problems with regard to a number of basic principles of freedom of association. A body appropriate for carrying out this examination is the Fact-Finding and conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association. In this regard the Committee would like to refer, as it has already done in its Fourth Report, to the resolution concerning freedom of association adopted by the Fifth Conference of American States Members of the ILO (Petropolis, April ). This draws the attention of governments which may be concerned in any cases which the Governing Body may recommend for referral to the Fact-Finding Commission for examination to the desirability of having full regard, when considering whether or not they are prepared to give their consent to such referral, to the advantages of impartial and objective examination of such allegations by the Commission as a means of alleviating tensions arising out of such allegations.
.Consequently the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide to request the Government of Chile to give its consent to the case's being referred to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association;(b) should the Government consent, to request the Director-General to submit more detailed proposals to the Governing Body at its next session, for the reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.Geneva,  February  (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a communication addressed to the ILO on  September . The WFTU formulated new allegations in two subsequent communications dated  September and  October . The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries is contained in a communication dated  September . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent its complaint to the ILO in a communication dated  September . The complaint of the Latin American Central of workers is contained in three communications dated ,  and  September . This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour. The International Metalworkers' Federation addressed its complaint to the ILO on  September , and the complaint of the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers is contained in a communication dated  September . The Trade Unions International of Workers in Commerce forwarded its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees forwarded its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The Miners' Trade Unions International sent its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The complaints of the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers are contained in communications dated ,  and  October  respectively.
.In view of the allegations formulated and the fears concerning the lives of several trade unionists expressed by the world Federation of Trade Unions in its first communication, the contents of the complaint were transmitted to the Government by telegram and then by letter indicating that this was a case considered urgent according to the procedure in force. All the other complaints were also submitted to the Government as they came in so that the Government might send its observations as soon as possible.
.During the session of the Committee on  November  a reply was received from the Government.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Protection of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has experienced particular difficulty in dealing with this case because the Government's reply reached it after the commencement of its session. In these circumstances it is not able to examine the substance of the issues placed before it nor can it reach any final conclusions. The Committee is perfectly aware of the serious situation which surrounds the case under its consideration. It wishes to point out in this respect that in cases where it has considered complaints concerning alleged infringements of trade union rights committed under a state of emergency or a state of siege or under the terms of an internal security Act, it has always expressed the opinion that it was not competent to come to a decision on the need or the advisability of such legislation, which is a question purely political in character, but it has been of the opinion that it should consider the repercussions which such legislation might have on the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee proposes to examine the case thoroughly at its next session, taking into account any new supplementary information which may be transmitted by either the complainants or the Government.
.At present, however, and as a preliminary measure, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at gravity of the allegations posed in the various complaints with respect to which it has just received a reply from the Government;(b) without at present coming to a conclusion as to the substance of the complainants' allegations, to call the attention of the Government(i) to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority;(ii) to the importance which it attaches to the principle of a fair trial by an independent and judiciary, and if possible by the regular courts, in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions;(c) to request the Government to transmit any supplementary information which it may obtain on the latest developments concerning the situation of the several persons mentioned in the complaints about whom it has already supplied certain information; and(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a new report to the Governing Body at its next session, taking into account any supplementary information which may be transmitted by either the complainants or the Government.Geneva,  November  (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1973,Chile
337,".The Committee examined this case in February and May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report and addendum to that report given in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of the addendum to the th Report.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the allegations related to an event which occurred before the change in government on  September , involving mainly the following facts. A group of sixteen trade unionists who, at a union meeting, had voted against the government takeover of the firm for which they worked, were prevented from entering their place of work by other workers in the firm. Confronted with this situation, the controller of the undertaking decided to dismiss ten of the trade unionists and set in motion the legal procedure to secure the waiving of the provisions concerning trade union immunity from dismissal in the case of the other six (five of whom were trade union leaders). Shortly afterwards, these leaders gave up their trade union functions on being censured by a union meeting, thereby losing the right, as trade unionists, to immunity against dismissal. Subsequently, one of them resigned from his employment and the other four were dismissed ""for reasons of service"".
.From the information available, it would appear that the action taken by the controller of the firm against the trade unionists was motivated partly by the need to deal with the situation that had arisen when the workers refused to allow the trade unionists to enter the undertaking. It would also appear, however, that these measures were applied as a penalty for the attitude taken at a trade union meeting against the takeover ordered by the Government. The Committee considered that a distinction should be made between, on the one hand, the responsibility of trade unionists towards their organisation in the event of its rules being infringed and, on the other hand, the actions of such trade unionists which might constitute failure to respect obligations inherent in their employment relations. If a particular form of behaviour on the part of certain members or leaders within the trade union organisation did not at the same time constitute a violation of their duties as workers, the penalties that might, on such grounds, be applied to them by an employer would amount to acts of discrimination likely to undermine freedom of association in connection with employment and workers should be protected against such acts.
.The Committee observed that the sixteen workers referred to in the complaint had appealed to the courts for recognition of their rights and that the relevant proceedings were still pending. It considered that the decisions reached were likely to provide it with further information on which to base its conclusions and recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in the preceding paragraph and to request it to provide the texts of the court decisions together with the grounds adduced therefor.
.In a communication of  February , the Government made certain observations on the Committee's conclusions and requested that they be examined by the Governing Body in conjunction with the report on the case. The Government disagreed in particular with the Committee's considerations as set out in paragraph  above. It stated that the takeover had been carried out in agreement with the workers, so that it could in no way be supposed that it had wished to infringe freedom of association in connection with employment and that the employees in question had acted as agents of the firm taken over, which had, for political reasons, suspended the manufacture and distribution of its products.
.The Committee stated that it had taken into account the fact that the controller had suspended from employment five trade union leaders and the staff representative (pending a subsequent application to the courts for authorisation to dismiss them) and had decided to terminate the contract of employment of ten other employees who had voted with the former against the takeover, at a union meeting, on the grounds that they had ""repeatedly failed to show the loyalty due to their fellow workers and to the undertaking as regards both the production and the marketing of its products"". The Committee still considered that both the facts reported and the reasons given by the controller for dismissing trade unionists not enjoying special immunity revealed a relation of cause and effect between the attitude to the takeover taken by the leaders and members of the union and the measures taken against them by the controller. This attitude had been decided upon at a union meeting and had taken the concrete form of a vote against the takeover; it did not appear from the information available that there had been any further action on the part of those concerned, such as an individual or collective stoppage of work. In other words, it was an attitude taken by certain trade unionists within the context of their union activities and it had no bearing on the discharge of their duties under their contract of employment. The Committee specified that it had never considered the taking over of the firm by the Government as an act of anti-union discrimination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to take note of the Government's observations and to decide that it was appropriate to adhere to the conclusions reached previously.
.The Professional Trade Union of Employees of the Maipu factory of Rayn Said Industrias Quimicas SA addressed a further communication to the ILO on  March . It referred to the change in government which took place in Chile on  September  and stated that the dismissed workers had since been reinstated. On  March  the Government submitted a large volume of documentation on the matter including in particular the text of two judgments dated  February  and  February , ordering the undertaking to reinstate four of the dismissed workers and to pay the wages and allowances which would have been payable during the period in which work was suspended.
.The complainant organisation submitted its complaint to the ILO on  June . It was transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations on  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The trade union's complaint, signed by Mr. Andrs Leiva Leiva, in his capacity as President, and by Mr. Blas Crdenas Vsquez, as Secretary, states that, on  May  admission to the factory in which they worked was refused to  employees including the entire trade union Committee ( persons), the staff representative and  former trade union officials who still enjoyed trade union immunity from dismissal. This action, adds the complaint, was taken by the government official who had been appointed controller of the undertaking and who made use of a group of workers, whose credulity and ignorance he exploited. The complainants maintain that this constituted a breach of contract and of trade union immunity and restricted the right to work. Incidents of this kind, the complainants conclude, are a frequent occurrence in Chile in undertakings taken over by the Government.
.In its reply, the Government states that the Rayn Said textile firm was taken over by the Government because of the stoppage in the production and distribution of yarns, as a result of which these products were in short supply on the market. The purpose of the takeover was to restore to normal the production and distribution of the goods manufactured in the establishment. On  May  the union executive convened a meeting of its members to discuss the ending of the takeover. Out of  members,  attended,  of whom voted in favour of the repeal of the takeover decree. Two days later a general meeting was held, for all the workers in the firm, at which it was decided by the majority of all the wage earners and salaried employees to refuse admission to work to the  members of the union who had voted for the end of the takeover. Faced with this situation, the government-appointed controller of the firm terminated the contracts of employment of the ten employees who did not enjoy trade union immunity ""for having repeatedly failed to show the loyalty due to their fellow workers and to the undertaking as regards both the production and the marketing of its products"". At the same time, the controller informed the Labour Inspectorate of the decision to suspend the five leaders and the staff representative and requested authorisation from the courts for an exception to be made in the case of these persons to the legislative provisions applicable to workers enjoying trade union immunity against dismissal.
.On  July",-1,1972,Chile
338,", the Government continues, the union members held an extraordinary meeting at which the majority passed a motion of censure against the executive of the organisation. According to the motion of censure, the leaders of the union had to resign immediately from their office and the members had to take the necessary steps for the appointment of new leaders. The Government adds that the former executive of the union, together with the staff representative, realising that it was impossible to continue working in the undertaking in view of the hostility, not only of the members of the union of wage earners of the firm, but also of the members of the salaried employees' union, chose to resign or terminate their employment relations with the undertaking.
.The Government states that the  persons affected by the measure adopted at the meeting took legal action to secure recognition of their rights. Some requested to be reinstated in their employment, considering that they had been unfairly dismissed. At the time of the Government's communication, the relevant legal proceedings were still pending. The Government concludes by saying that the firm has paid the former members of the executive and the staff representative what was due to them in accordance with the law and that it has not infringed the legislative provisions concerning trade union immunity, which they no longer enjoyed since they had been censured by a meeting of the very union they were supposed to represent.
.The Committee has taken note of the documentation sent by the Government with its communication, from which it appears that in August , one of the members of the executive of the union resigned from his employment while the remaining four were dismissed ""for reasons connected with the undertaking"". It is also apparent from these documents that the motion of censure against the union leaders was motivated by their infringement of the union rules and particularly by their political activities, it being considered ""inadmissible and in obvious breach of the union rules to take advantage, for ends and purposes of this kind, of the exclusively trade union office to which they had been elected"".
.The Committee observes that in the present case a group of  trade unionists who, at a union meeting, had voted against the government takeover of the firm for which they worked, were prevented from entering their place of work by other workers in the firm. Confronted with this situation, the government-appointed controller of the undertaking decided to dismiss  of the trade unionists and set in motion the legal procedure to secure the waiving of the provisions concerning trade union immunity from dismissal in the case of the other  ( of whom were trade union leaders). Shortly afterwards, these leaders gave up their trade union functions upon being censured by the union meeting, thereby losing the right, as trade unionists, to immunity against dismissal. Subsequently one of them resigned from his employment and the other four were dismissed ""for reasons connected with the firm"".
.From the information available, it would appear that the action taken by the government-appointed controller of the firm against the trade unionists was motivated partly by; the need to deal with a situation that had arisen when the workers refused to allow the trade unionists to enter the undertaking; it would also appear, however, that these measures were applied as a penalty for the attitude taken at a trade union meeting against the takeover ordered by the Government. In general terms, the Committee considers that a distinction should be made between, on the one hand, the responsibility of trade unionists towards their organisation in the event of its rules being infringed, and on the other hand, the actions of such trade unionists which might constitute a violation of the duties inherent in their employment relations. If a particular form of behaviour on the part of certain members or leaders within the trade union organisation did not at the same time constitute a violation of their duties as workers, the penalties that might, on such grounds, be applied to them by an employer would amount to acts of discrimination likely to undermine freedom of association in connection with employment and workers should be protected against such acts.",2,1972,Chile
339,".This case was dealt with by the Committee at its Session of November  when it presented a report which appears in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was submitted to the Governing Body for examination at its th Session (February-March ). Since new information was received from the Government the Governing Body decided at that meeting to postpone examination of the case.
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  November . In another communication of  January  the complainants submitted additional information. The communications were sent to the Government, which submitted its observations on them on  May and  December  and on  February .
.In a letter dated  November  the complainants alleged that the Government had violated the principles of freedom of association in Manufacturas Sumar, which had been taken over and placed under the control of an administrator appointed by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce.
.The complainants ""in their capacity as managers"" of the above-mentioned trade union stated that they had been dismissed from the company on  August  in spite of the protection afforded by labour law to trade union leaders and that thirty-five other workers had also been dismissed from the company on the same date. According to the complainants their dismissal as trade union leaders is contrary to section  of the Labour Code and section  of Act No. . The complainants also alleged that they were dismissed by reason of their trade union activity in the defence of their companions at work who had been unjustly persecuted because of their political opinions. The complainants added that they had instituted court proceedings to secure the reinstatement of the persons concerned on  September . The complaint provided no further information about the other thirty-five workers.
.According to section  of the Labour Code the members of the executive Committee of the trade union may not be dismissed from an undertaking without the consent of a labour judge whose consent shall be granted only in certain clearly specified cases. Section  of Act No. , which lays down rules for the termination of contracts of employment, provides that trade union leaders may not be dismissed by their employers without authorisation from a judge, that such authorisation may be granted only in certain clearly specified cases (assault, insulting language or highly immoral conduct, intentional damage to plant, etc.). It was stated that this prior authorisation had never been given by a judge.
.In its reply dated  May  the Government does not question the status of Messrs. Toro Trujillo and Jara Viveros as trade union leaders or the protection against dismissal which the provisions mentioned guarantee. However, the Government affirms that the persons concerned were covered by one of the specific cases permitting dismissal, since they had organised a stoppage of work on  August  in order to prevent the administrator appointed by the Government from carrying out his duties. This stoppage, according to the Government, was manifestly unlawful because it not only failed to comply with the requirements laid down by Chilean law for stoppages to be considered lawful, but also because it was motivated by non-occupational considerations"". The Government stated, however, that owing to an erroneous interpretation of the law the administrator of the company did not apply for authorisation from the labour judge for dismissing the trade union leaders concerned. The Government added that in the case mentioned by the complainants the administrative authorities could not be held responsible for this error of interpretation since responsibility lay with the administrator, who, in spite of his status as a civil servant, was independent of the administrative authorities in so far as he represented the undertaking. The Government states that if a request for authorisation to dismiss the officials had been made, it would have been granted by the judge.
.It appears from the Government's communication, which provides information on the progress made in the judicial proceedings instituted by the persons concerned after their dismissal, that the matter is still under consideration. The Government states, however, that apart from the court proceedings, negotiations have been held with the persons concerned in an effort to meet agreement. The proceedings instituted by the other workers dismissed in connection with the same events are now closed; some of the persons concerned had withdrawn their appeals and the others had been compensated. The President of the Republic had personally intervened with a view to an amicable settlement being reached.
.In the light of this information the Committee presented certain interim conclusions in its th Report. The Government in its communication of  December  pointed out that the complaint had not been submitted by the Non-manual Workers' Union of Manufacturas Sumar but by two ex-leaders of that union, that it did not appear to have been signed either by either the President or the Secretary of the trade union, and that it did not bear the address or seal of the organisation. Consequently the Government requested that the report of the Committee should be modified accordingly. Subsequently in its communication of  February  the Government presented additional information concerning the substance of the question.
.In this communication the Government repeats certain statements which appeared in its reply of  May , concerning the lawfulness of the stoppages in which the complainants and other workers took part. The Government adds that Act No.  of  provides that one of the grounds on which an employment contract may be terminated is refusal without justification to perform the tasks agreed in the contract and maintains that a stoppage constitutes such a cause, as Chilean tribunals have considered according to the jurisprudence of the country. Thus in accordance with labour legislation the social and economic claims of workers may be expressed only through the procedure laid down in the Labour Code and in Regulation  concerning collective disputes. The process of conciliation provided in legislation may be followed by a strike if there is no agreement between the parties, but an unwarranted interruption of work, or a stoppage, is punishable by the termination of the contract of employment.
.In various previous cases', the Committee has considered that the fact of requiring certain conditions to be filled before a strike is considered legal, provided always that such conditions are reasonable, does not constitute a violation of trade union freedom. The new information supplied by the Government shows that the complainants and other workers declared a strike in an unwarranted manner and without having complied with the requirement of prior conciliation as provided by law. The Committee has also considered that the principle according to which a worker or trade union leader must not suffer prejudice on account of his trade union activities does not necessarily imply that the fact of holding trade union office confers upon the holder an immunity against possible dismissal whatever its causes.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that the dismissal of the complainants did not take place in circumstances such as to allow an allegation of violation of the principles concerning protection of the right of association and consequently recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not require further examination.",0,1971,Chile
340,".The complaint by the Chilean Confederation of Labour (C.U.T.C.H.) and other trade union organisations was made in a letter dated  May . This letter was communicated to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  April .
.Chile has ratified the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.According to the complainants, trade union organisations and collective disputes in agriculture in Chile are subject to special regulations which are separate from those applying to industrial workers. These regulations are contained in Act No.  of  July , which was passed many years after the Government had ratified Convention No. . The provisions of this Act are alleged to constitute a flagrant breach of the Convention not only because they subject agricultural workers to a different system from that applying to industrial workers but also because the relevant standards are so restrictive as to amount to a denial of freedom of association in agriculture. Accordingly, trade unions in agriculture are few in number, and those that do exist lead a precarious life which makes them completely incapable of defending and promoting the interests of their members. The observations made year after year by the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Conference have so far had no effect, and farm workers continue to be covered by legislation which should never have been passed or should have been repealed. After these preliminary remarks the complainants give details of all the statutory provisions affecting agricultural trade unions which conflict with Convention No. .
.In its observations the Government states that at first glance a comparison between the standards applicable to workers in industry and those embodied in Act No.  concerning trade unionism among agricultural workers shows that the Chilean system does not give "" all persons employed in agriculture the same rights of association as workers in industry "". Accordingly, despite the fact that the Government has ratified Convention No. , the legislation now in force conflicts with the latter's standards. The Government adds that it should be borne in mind that the fact that agricultural workers are entitled to the same rights of association as industrial workers does not constitute an adequate safeguard in Chile, because on the whole the legislation applicable to the formation of trade unions by workers in industry, commerce, mining, etc., does not conform either to the standards of freedom of association laid down in Convention No. .
.In view of the foregoing the Government submitted a Bill to the National Congress on  February  making substantial changes in the legislation on trade unions to bring it into line with Convention No.  and make it applicable to all workers, whatever their occupation. In order to clarify its explanations the Government forwarded a copy of the legislation now applicable to agricultural workers' unions, as well as that embodied in the Bill recently submitted to the National Congress.
.The Committee observes that, for many years past, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been making observations to the Chilean Government with respect to the application of Convention No. . In these observations the Committee of Experts has specifically pointed out the fundamental discrepancies between the legislation on trade unionism among agricultural workers and the legislation on the same subject applicable to industrial workers. These discrepancies relate to the following points.
.Whereas according to section  of the Labour Code workers may set up two types of unions-works unions or occupational unions-agricultural workers under section  of the same Code may constitute trade unions only within the limits of an agricultural undertaking. As a result, agricultural workers do not have the right to set up unions extending beyond an undertaking or to set up federations and Confederations. There are also differences in the treatment of works unions and agricultural unions, some of which have the effect of substantially curtailing the right of association of agricultural workers. This applies, for example, to the administration of their funds and collective disputes. As regards the latter, under section  of the Labour Code unions of agricultural workers may not present statements of claims during the sowing and harvesting periods and, in any event, not more than once a year. The Committee of Experts took the view that this had no equivalent in the legislation relating to industrial workers and concluded that it led in practice to a denial to agricultural workers of any right to organise effectively, particularly in the case of seasonal or casual workers. Lastly, the provisions of section  of the Labour Code resulted in fact in prohibiting seasonal or casual workers from setting up trade unions. This was particularly important in the case of estates which employed a large proportion of seasonal or casual workers.
.The Committee has also taken note of the fact that the Government has submitted a Bill on trade unions to Congress. Under section  of this Bill, "" salaried employees and wage earners, whether or not employed by another person, and irrespective of their trade, occupation or activity, are entitled to form associations "". This Bill does not discriminate in the case of agricultural workers. Section  states that "" employers in agriculture must allow trade unions the fullest facilities to operate within their undertakings. To this end they must provide them with the premises needed to carry on their normal activity and shall permit free access by workers and their leaders to such premises and any meetings held thereon "". The Committee observes that the Committee of Experts also took note of this Bill and the fact that it applied without distinction to workers in industry and agriculture and expressed the hope that its early adoption would at last bring the legislation into full conformity with Convention No. .
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the discrepancies which continue to exist between the legislation still in force concerning agricultural trade unions and the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Chile;(b) to take note with interest of the Bill on trade unions recently submitted by the Government to Congress in order to eliminate these discrepancies; and(c) to request the Government to keep it informed as to any development in this matter, especially as regards the foregoing Bill, and to express the hope that it will soon be enacted.",-1,1963,Chile
341,".The complaint of the World Federation of Teachers' Unions is contained in a communication dated  June . The Government of Chile forwarded its observations by a letter dated  September .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that teaching staff in Chile are denied the right to belong to trade unions, and in support of their allegation they quote Part III, paragraph , section  of the Administrative Statutes (Legislative Decree No.  of  April ) as stipulating that:wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State shall not have the right to form or belong to any union, nor to form brigades, teams or operational groups which are essentially political in character. Nor shall they have the right to go on strike, nor to suspend or interrupt their work completely or partially in any manner, nor to commit any act of such nature as to interfere with the normal functioning of the service to which they belong.
.In its reply of  September  the Government states that the provision referred to by the complainants is indeed in force in Chile, and that it is applicable not only to the teaching profession but to all wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State, and adds that in view of the existence of this provision the Government has no other course but to comply with it. The Government goes on to state that, notwithstanding the existence of the measure in question, teachers are in fact organised in the Chilean National Teachers' Association and other bodies which carry on an active campaign on behalf of their members, even going so far as strike action.
.The Committee observes that another provision in Chilean law-namely section  of the Labour Code-lays down that:wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State or municipal authorities or belonging to state undertakings shall not have the right to form a union or to belong to any union.
.In the light of the expressly stated ban on the forming of trade unions by workers in the service of the State contained in both the Administrative Statutes and the Labour Code, the Committee feels impelled, bearing in mind the principle laid down in other cases I regarding the importance of the right of state and local government employees to constitute and register trade unions, to point out that these provisions of Chilean legislation are incompatible with the generally accepted principle that workers, without distinction whatsoever, should have the right to form organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation. This principle has been embodied by the International Labour Conference in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which reads as follows:Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.
.The Committee, while observing that according to the Government's statement Chilean teachers are in fact organised into an association whose activities may be said to correspond to those of a trade union, reaffirms the opinion expressed on earlier occasions that the right of workers to form freely organisations of their own choosing cannot be deemed to be operative unless it is fully recognised and respected in law and in fact.
.Bearing in mind also that when on a previous occasion it had before it allegations similar to those now being considered and also relating to Chile, it drew the attention of the Government to the incompatibility of section  of the Chilean Labour Code with the principle that workers, including those employed by the State, should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation, the Committee considers that the Chilean Government should be requested to consider the possibility of repealing those provisions under present law which prohibit employees of the State from establishing and belonging to trade unions.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government of Chile once again to the importance which it attaches to the principles that workers, without distinction whatsoever, including those employed by the State, should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation, and to request the Government to consider the possibility of repealing the provisions of section  of the Labour Code and section  of the Administrative Statutes, which are incompatible with the foregoing principle.",0,1962,Chile
342,".The Committee has already made several interim reports to the Governing Body on this case. At the May () Session it submitted the following recommendation in paragraph  of its rd Report:The Committee notes with interest the communication received from the Government, which quotes the operative part of the Supreme Court's judgment. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that the Court also refers to the judgments of first and second instance, which appear to have contained a detailed analysis of the reasons for the measures taken against Mr. Snchez Ossandn in the light of de facto and de jure aspects of the case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, in order to secure all the material needed to come to a conclusion on this case, to request the Government to be good enough to forward copies of these judgments and their grounds.
.The rd Report was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (May-June ) and the request contained in paragraph  thereof was communicated to the Government by letter dated  June .
.The original complaint figures in a communication dated  August  which was sent to the I.L.O by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers. The same organisation gave supplementary information in a letter of  October . The Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint to the same effect in a letter dated  October . The above communications, and further information provided by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers in a letter of  January , were transmitted to the Government in due course.
.The Government of Chile sent its first reply on  November .
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee last examined this case in full at its meeting in May , when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it made the above-mentioned interim report the Committee recalled the terms of the complaint and the Government's reply, which contained details of the court proceedings arising out of the dismissal of a trade union official, Enrique Snchez Ossandn.
.The complainants allege that Mr. Enrique Snchez Ossandn, present Chairman of the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers and a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission, who was employed by Madeco S.A. (a copper-manufacturing company), was dismissed from that undertaking for having attended the th Session of the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva in June . The complainants add that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was appointed technical adviser to the workers under Decree No.  of  June ; that on the same day he informed Madeco of his appointment, sent a copy of the communication to the Labour Inspectorate and asked the Ministry of Labour to notify Madeco of the appointment, which was done on  June by official letter No. ; that Madeco, in its reply of  June  to official letter No. , stated that the company reserved all the necessary rights in regard to the situation created by Mr. Snchez Ossandn through having absented himself from his work without previous permission. The complainants enclosed with their complaint a copy of the said Decree No. , of the letters dated  and  June  and of official letter No.  of  June . When Mr. Snchez Ossandn returned to Chile and reported to the Madeco Company to resume his duties, he was not allowed access to his work and was informed that his services were terminated; he reported this to the Labour Inspectorate on  August and at the same time lodged a request with the labour court to be reinstated, since he enjoyed trade union privilege through being a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission and Chairman of the Confederation of Metal Workers' Unions. Mr. Snchez Ossandn brought the case to the notice of the Ministry of Labour, which, according to the complainants, made representations to Madeco but could not induce the company to change its attitude. The complainants add that the attitude of Madeco is merely a continuance of a campaign of outright persecution against Mr. Snchez Ossandn on the sole ground of his trade union activity.
.In its reply dated  November  the Government of Chile stated that as soon as the competent authorities were informed of the matter they had instructed the labour services to investigate the facts and demand compliance with the rules protecting the privilege of trade union leaders, of whom Mr. Snchez Ossandn was one. The Government added that the Provincial Labour Inspectorate had taken measures accordingly and, in view of the undertaking's refusal to reinstate Mr. Snchez Ossandn, had laid information with the labour courts for contravention of the existing rules which forbid dismissal or the mere suspension of trade union rights without previous statutory permission. Further, the Government added in its reply, the Ministry of Labour had directly requested Madeco to explain the implications of its decision and, if possible, to reconsider the step it had taken, but was unsuccessful in this; a memorandum from the Managing Director of Madeco contended that Mr. Snchez Ossandn had not been dismissed but that his work contract had lapsed for reasons which might be summed up as frequent absences from work and abandonment of his post when he went to Geneva.
.When judgment had been given in the action against the firm of Madeco for failure to comply with statutory procedure governing the dismissal of a trade union official, the Government forwarded copies of the verdict given by the courts of first and second instance and, finally, by the Supreme Court. These verdicts showed that the firm had been sentenced to a fine for failure to comply with the law.
.Nevertheless, as regards the position of Mr. Snchez Ossandn, the Committee noted that a communication from the Government dated  February  stated that the Ministry of Labour had ascertained that he had not resumed work and had been paid no compensation, and that the case was still pending in the labour courts.
.In these circumstances the Committee took the view that the judgment of the labour courts might make available information that would be useful in appreciating whether the allegations were justified, and recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to forward a copy of the judgment, and to decide in the meantime to postpone its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In a memorandum dated  December  the Government stated that the court of the first instance had dismissed Mr. Snchez Ossandn's case, but that he had lodged an appeal; when a final verdict had been given the Government would forward a copy.
.In view of this situation and the lack of any further information from the Government, the Committee decided, at its th, th, th and th meetings, to postpone its examination of the case while asking the Government to be good enough to forward the necessary information as soon as possible.
.In a memorandum dated  March  the Government supplied additional information about the case. The verdict given by the court of second instance was partly favourable to Mr. Snchez Ossandn, but the defendants lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, which gave its judgment on  July . The latter body stated that all the facts recorded in the judgment of first instance showed in a way that left no room for doubt that the plaintiff repeatedly broke his contract of employment and that this constituted a ground for the lapsing of this contract, as stated by the defendants. Accordingly the Court accepted the latter's appeal and quashed the judgment of the court of second instance, upholding in all respects the judgment of first instance which had dismissed Mr. Snchez Ossandn's case.
.In all cases which are the subject of pending national judicial proceedings affording all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure the Committee has always followed the practice of not proceeding to examine such cases if the proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded. In many cases the Committee has asked governments to forward copies of judgments given and their grounds.
.The Committee has examined this case on two previous occasions: at its th Session (February ), when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at the nd Session (June ); and at its nd Session (October ), when it submitted another interim report in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at the rd",-1,1961,Chile
343,"Session (November ).
.Paragraph  of the th Report reads as follows:
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government, having regard to the fact that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was dismissed by his employer on his return from the International Labour Conference as adviser to the Workers' delegate and that a penalty has been imposed by the Supreme Court on the employer, to indicate whether he has been reinstated with the Madeco company or, if this is not the case, in what way he has been compensated for the harm done to him by his dismissal;(b) to request the Government to furnish its observations as soon as possible on the allegation that the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers was unable to put forward candidates for membership of the Workers' delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference for fear of reprisals by the employers.
.That decision of the Governing Body was communicated to the Government by letter dated  November .
.At its rd Session (February ) the Committee deferred consideration of the case because it had not received the information requested from the Government.
.The Chilean Government sent the said information on  February .
.The original complaint was contained in a communication addressed directly to the I.L.O on  August  by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers.
.In a letter dated  October  the Chilean Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint on the same grounds. The Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers supplemented by a letter dated  October  the information contained in its first communication. The contents of both letters were communicated to the Government on  November . By a communication dated  January  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers furnished further information, which has also been transmitted to the Government.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, with regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of a trade union officer, to request the Government to furnish the text of the judgment in the action initiated by Mr. Snchez Ossandn before the labour courts, and to defer further examination of these allegations for the time being.
.The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (February ), when it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (June ).
.Paragraph  of the st Report reads as follows:
.In the present case the Committee has considered it advisable to follow its usual practice and to ask the Director-General to request the Government to inform it of the result of the action instituted and, in particular, to furnish the text of the judgment given and of the legal reasons and conclusions adduced, and in the meantime to adjourn its further examination of the case.
.The Governing Body's decision to this effect was communicated to the Government of Chile by letter dated  June .
.By a communication dated  September  the Chilean Government has furnished the information requested.
.The original complaint was contained in a communication addressed directly to the I.L.O on  August  by the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers.
.In a letter dated  October  the Chilean Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint on the same grounds. The Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers supplemented by a letter dated  October  the information contained in its first communication. The contents of both letters were communicated to the Government on  November . By a communication dated  January  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers furnished further information, which has been transmitted to the Government.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government, having regard to the fact that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was dismissed by his employer on his return from the International Labour Conference as adviser to the Workers' delegate and that a penalty has been imposed by the Supreme Court on the employer to indicate whether he has been reinstated with the Madeco company or, if this is not the case, in what way he has been compensated for the harm done to him by his dismissal;(b) to request the Government to furnish its observations as soon as possible on the allegation that the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers was unable to put forward candidates for membership of the Workers' delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference for fear of reprisals by the employers.
.In a communication addressed to the I.L.O on  August  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers submitted a complaint of alleged violations of freedom of association in Chile. This complaint was communicated to the Government on  September .
.In a letter dated  October  the Chilean Confederation of Privately Employed Clerical Workers submitted a complaint on the same grounds. The Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers supplemented by a letter dated  October  the information contained in its first communication. The contents of both letters were communicated to the Government on  November . By a communication dated  January  the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers furnished further information, which has been transmitted to the Government.
.In a communication dated  November  the Government of Chile presented its observations on the complaints which had been transmitted to it on  November .
.The complainants allege that Mr. Enrique Snchez Ossandn, present Chairman of the Chilean Confederation of Industrial and Commercial Workers and a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission, who was employed by Manufacturas de Cobre (Madeco) S.A., was dismissed from that undertaking for having attended the th Session of the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva in June , as adviser to the Chilean Workers' delegate. The complainants add that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was appointed adviser to the Workers' delegate under Decree No.  of  June ; that on the same day Mr. Snchez Ossandn informed Madeco of his appointment, sent a copy of the communication to the Labour Inspectorate and asked the Ministry of Labour to notify Madeco of the appointment, which was done on  June by official letter No. : that Madeco, in its reply on  June  to official letter No. , stated that the company reserved all the necessary rights in regard to the situation created by Mr. Snchez Ossandn through having absented himself from his work without previous permission. The complainants enclosed with their complaint a copy of the said Decree No. , of the letters dated  and  June  and of official letter No.  of  June .
.Again, according to the complainants, when Mr. Snchez Ossandn returned to Chile and reported to the Madeco company to resume his duties, he was not allowed access to his work and was informed that his service was terminated; he reported this to the Labour Inspectorate on  August and at the same time lodged a request with the Labour Tribunal to be reinstated, since he enjoyed trade union privilege through being a member of the Central Mixed Wages Commission and also Chairman of the Confederation of Metal Workers' Unions. Mr. Snchez Ossandn brought the case to the notice of the Ministry of Labour who, according to the complainants, made representations to Madeco, but could not induce it to change its attitude. The complainants add that the attitude of Madeco is merely a continuance of a campaign of outright persecution against Mr. Snchez Ossandn on the sole ground of his trade union activity.
.In its reply dated  November  the Government of Chile states that as soon as the competent authorities were informed of the matter they instructed the labour services to investigate the facts and demand compliance with the rules protecting the privilege of trade union leaders, a position held by Mr. Snchez Ossandn. The Government adds that the Provincial Labour Inspectorate took measures accordingly and, in view of the undertaking's refusal to reinstate Mr. Snchez Ossandn, laid information with the Labour Courts for contravention of the existing rules which forbid dismissal or the mere suspension of trade union rights, without previous statutory permission. Further, the Government adds in its reply, the Ministry of Labour directly requested Madeco to explain the implications of its decision and if possible to reconsider the step it had taken, but was unsuccessful in this; a memorandum from the Managing Director of Madeco S.A. contended that Mr. Snchez Ossandn was not dismissed but that his work contract had lapsed for reasons which may be summed up as frequent absences from work and abandonment of his post when he went to Geneva. The Government concludes by saying that, since the Ministry of Labour has by process",-1,1961,Chile
344,"of law formally laid information through the Provincial Labour Inspectorate in Santiago against Madeco for contravention of a law, the matter must now await a formal decision by the Court.
.The Committee observes that there appears to be no contradiction between the facts as stated by the complainants and the statement by the Government, which not only does not refute them but confirms them.
.Paragraph  of article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O provides: "" Delegates to the Conference, members of the Governing Body and the Director-General and officials of the Office shall likewise enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation.""
.The Committee considers, as it did in a previous similar case, that no delegate to any organ or conference of the I.L.O should be interfered with in any way to prevent or to deter him from carrying out his functions and that it is evident that if a delegate, after attending a conference convened by the International Labour Organisation, can become the subject of measures such as were taken in the present case, the possibility of such measures being taken is such as to prevent or to deter the delegate from carrying out his functions.
.The Committee recognises that the Government appears at once to have realised the importance of the case and to have intervened directly with the undertaking which employed Mr. Snchez Ossandn in order to induce it to reinstate him, and subsequently showed its strong disapproval of the contravention committed by the Madeco Company by initiating judicial proceedings which are now passing through the Provincial Labour Inspectorate in Santiago.
.In previous cases the Committee has followed the practice of not proceeding to examine matters which are the subject of pending judicial proceedings where the pending judicial decision may make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations are well-founded.
.In the present case the Committee has considered it advisable to follow its usual practice and to ask the Director-General to request the Government to inform it of the result of the action instituted, and in particular, to furnish the text of the judgment given and of the legal reasons and conclusions adduced, and in the meantime to adjourn its further examination of the case.",-1,1961,Chile
345,".At its th Session (Geneva, May ), the Committee had before it a series of complaints, constituting Cases Nos. , ,  and , relating to Chile. The cases were considered together.
.The Committee's conclusions regarding the different allegations made by the complainants are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and its recommendations to the Governing Body in paragraph . The Committee's th Report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, May-June ).
.On three of these allegations the Committee submitted only interim conclusions. The allegations in question are those relating to the imprisonment of trade unionists, with regard to which the Government was asked to supply additional information, and those relating to violation of trade union rights and to reprisals against trade unionists in connection with a strike of bank employees and a strike in the nitrate mines, with regard to which the Government had not Yet forwarded its observations
.These three groups of allegations are the only ones still before the Committee for consideration, and the following analyses relate exclusively to these three groups.
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the observations which it made in paragraphs  and  of the th Report of the Committee concerning the severity of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy with respect to the question of strikes, and to suggest to the Government once again that it might consider the possibility of re-examining the provisions of that Law in the light of the generally accepted principles with respect to freedom of association ; but to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above and having regard to the fact that all the five persons concerned have been liberated, that it is inappropriate to pursue further the examination of the allegations relating to the arrest and sentencing of the leaders of the Sole Union of Chilean Workers (C.U.T.CH) ;(b) to take note with satisfaction, with respect to the arrests of the hundred or so persons alleged by the World Federation of Trade Unions, of the Government's statement that all the persons in question were liberated on  February  and to decide that this aspect of the case does not, therefore, call for further examination ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that acts of discrimination in connection with a peaceful strike are inconsistent with the maintenance of satisfactory industrial relations and incompatible with the best industrial practice and to the undesirability of persons appointed temporarily by the Government to control the banks falling below this standard ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that the initiation of the measures against Mr. Goldsack Donoso in his absence by the government controller of the bank by which he was employed is inconsistent with the duty of the Government both to refrain itself from taking measures calculated to interfere with a delegate to an I.L.O. Conference in the exercise of his functions and to use its influence and take all reasonable steps to ensure that such a delegate is not in any way prejudiced by his acceptance of functions as a delegate or by his conduct as a delegate ; that measures on other grounds should not be taken against him in his absence but should await his return, so that he may be in a position to defend himself ; that in the above circumstances it is insufficient for the Government to dissociate itself from the future course and consequences of the measures taken, and that it would be appropriate for the Government to take steps to ensure either that the measures taken against Mr. Goldsack Donoso are revoked or that he is fully compensated ;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body whether a committee of investigation was instituted for the purpose of determining the responsibility for the incidents connected with the strike in the nitrate mines and, if so, to inform the Governing Body as to the results of its inquiry.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has before it the following complaints which, for the sake of clarity, are divided into two separate groups. The first group (Cases Nos.  and ) includes : () a verbal protest made on behalf of the Workers' group of the Governing Body by its President at the st Session of the Governing Body (Geneva, March ) ; () complaint of  February  by the World Federation of Trade Unions supplemented by additional information dated  March and  May  ; () complaint of  March  by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions supplemented by additional information of  May  ; () complaint of  February  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile supplemented by additional information of  June  ; () complaint of  March  by the Confederation of Latin American Workers supplemented by additional information of  April  ; () complaint of  March  by the Maritime Confederation of Chile ; () complaint of  May  by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile and  other national trade union federations of Chile, quoting article  of the Constitution of the I.L.O. ; () complaint of  February  by the Sole Union of Chilean Workers ; () complaint of  November  by the ""Sekretariat D.P.P. Sebda "" (the Pan-Indonesian Central Council of Trade Unions) ; () complaint of  November  by the Posts and Communications Trade Union of the Free German Trade Unions (Berlin) ; () complaint of  March  by the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers ; and () a telegram of  March  from the People's Socialist Party of Chile. This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  January ,  and  March,  May,  June and  July  and  March , with the exception of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers and the telegram of the People's Socialist Party which reproduce the allegations presented by the National Bakers' Federation of Chile. Since the whole of this group deals with related complaints they are examined together. The second group of complaints (Cases Nos.  and ) consists of the following : () complaint of  October  from the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay ; () complaints of  October and  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions ; () complaint of  October  from the Miners' Trade Unions International (W.F.T.U) supplemented by additional information dated  November  ; () complaint of  November  from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions of Salaried Employees, Technicians, Managerial Staff and Commercial Travellers ; and () complaint of  November  from the Inter-, national Confederation of Free Trade Unions. This group of complaints was communicated by the Director-General of the I.L.O to the Chilean Government by letters dated  October,  November and  December  ; they refer particularly to the strike of Chilean bank employees in September  and the strike in the nitrate mines of Pedro de Valdivia, also in September .
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the provisions contained in article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that members of the Governing Body shall enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation and to decide that, subject to the observations made in paragraphs  to  above, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the recommendations made by the Governing Body when approving the Committee's previous reports concerning Cases Nos.  and  that it should examine the desirability of reconsidering the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy in the light of generally accepted principles relating to freedom of association ;(c) for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, to draw the urgent attention of the Government of Chile to the conclusions of the Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, approved by the International Labour Conference at its th Session, and of the Committee of Experts in , with respect to the application in Chile of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, , ratified by Chile, and to emphasise the importance of its taking steps without further delay to bring its national legislation into harmony with the obligations solemnly undertaken by the ratification of the Convention ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the desirability of taking the necessary steps to ensure that a freely constituted central organisation of workers can function freely and, with this end of view, of examining the possibility of bringing Chilean",1,1956,Chile
346,"legislation into conformity with the principle that workers' and employers' organisations should have the right to establish and join federations and Confederations ;(e) for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the incompatibility of article  of the Chilean Labour Code with the principle that workers, including those employed by the State, should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without prior authorisation ;(f) for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to draw the attention of the Government of Chile to the fact that Decree No.  of  September  which requires candidates for trade union office to have obtained the approval of the Provincial Governor, given on the basis of a report from the police investigation department, is incompatible with the principle that employers' and workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom ;(g) to decide that the allegations relating to the exercise of the right to strike (subject to the observation made in paragraph  above), violations of the freedom of expression, obstacles placed in the way of the Constitution of trade unions, the disqualification of trade union leaders in the province of Concepcin and the application of the law for the stabilisation of salaries, wages and prices do not call for further examination, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs , ,  and  above ;(h) for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the allegations relating to the detention of trade unionists, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the supplementary information that it is requesting from the Government of Chile ;(i) to request the Chilean Government to be so good as to consider the advisability of making a comprehensive examination of its existing legislation in the light of the preceding recommendations and the provisions of the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, , the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  ; and(j) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the second group of complaints analysed above (Cases Nos.  and ), it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the observations requested from the Government of Chile.",-1,1956,Chile

.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to reaffirm the observations which it made in paragraphs  and  of the th Report of the Committee concerning the severity of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy with respect to the question of strikes, and to suggest to the Government once again that it might consider the possibility of re-examining the provisions of that Law in the light of the generally accepted principles with respect to freedom of association ; but to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  to  above and having regard to the fact that all the five persons concerned have been liberated, that it is inappropriate to pursue further the examination of the allegations relating to the arrest and sentencing of the leaders of the Sole Union of Chilean Workers (C.U.T.CH) ;(b) to take note with satisfaction, with respect to the arrests of the hundred or so persons alleged by the World Federation of Trade Unions, of the Government's statement that all the persons in question were liberated on  February  and to decide that this aspect of the case does not, therefore, call for further examination ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that acts of discrimination in connection with a peaceful strike are inconsistent with the maintenance of satisfactory industrial relations and incompatible with the best industrial practice and to the undesirability of persons appointed temporarily by the Government to control the banks falling below this standard ;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to its view that the initiation of the measures against Mr. Goldsack Donoso in his absence by the government controller of the bank by which he was employed is inconsistent with the duty of the Government both to refrain itself from taking measures calculated to interfere with a delegate to an I.L.O. Conference in the exercise of his functions and to use its influence and take all reasonable steps to ensure that such a delegate is not in any way prejudiced by his acceptance of functions as a delegate or by his conduct as a delegate ; that measures on other grounds should not be taken against him in his absence but should await his return, so that he may be in a position to defend himself ; that in the above circumstances it is insufficient for the Government to dissociate itself from the future course and consequences of the measures taken, and that it would be appropriate for the Government to take steps to ensure either that the measures taken against Mr. Goldsack Donoso are revoked or that he is fully compensated ;(e) to request the Government to be good enough to inform the Governing Body whether a committee of investigation was instituted for the purpose of determining the responsibility for the incidents connected with the strike in the nitrate mines and, if so, to inform the Governing Body as to the results of its inquiry.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has before it the following complaints which, for the sake of clarity, are divided into two separate groups.

352,".The complainants allege that trade union rights have been infringed by the following measures:(a) adoption of anti-union legislation ;(b) declaration of a state of siege in the mining region.
.This complaint was transmitted to the I.L.O by the Economic and Social Council, at its th Session, and, so far as the first allegation is concerned, relates, as is explained below, to matters which came before the Committee at its meeting in May . The second allegation, therefore, is the only one, which raises new matters for consideration by the Committee.
.In reply to the complainants' two allegations, the Chilean Government puts forward the following arguments:(a) The only recently adopted law dealing with trade union organisation is the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy, the codified text of which was promulgated by Decree No.  of  September . This law was the subject of an earlier complaint by the W.F.T.U. The Governing Body of the I.L.O decided that case in favour of the Chilean Government.(b) With regard to the second allegation, the Government states that in no region of the Republic has a state of siege been proclaimed by the present Government during its last six years of activity.
.The complainants have given no details in support of the allegation of the adoption of anti-union legislation. The Chilean Government states that the complaint apparently refers to the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy. In fact, promulgated in the form of a code in , this text constitutes the most recent measure dealing with trade union rights.
.It will be remembered that the above law was the subject of Case No. , dealt with in the Committee's fourth report to the Governing Body. In this connection the Committee recommended the Governing Body:(a) to decide that the complainants had not presented sufficient evidence to justify reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission ;(b) to suggest that the Chilean Government might wish to re-examine certain Articles of the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy, in particular Articles  and , with a view to determining whether any modifications of them are desirable in the light of the provisions of the Conventions concerning freedom of association and protection of the right to organise (), and concerning the right to organise and to bargain collectively ().
.At its th Session (May ), the Governing Body endorsed the Committee's recommendation.
.In the present complaint the W.F.T.U raises no new considerations. In these circumstances the Committee considers that there is no ground for re-examining the allegation relating to the Law for the Permanent Defence of Democracy, concerning which the Committee has already reached a decision.
.In view of the Chilean Government's categorical statement that no state of siege has been proclaimed in any region of the country during the last six years, the Committee is of the opinion that, in the absence of sufficient evidence being offered by the complainants, the second allegation does not call for further examination by the Governing Body.
.With regard to the case as a whole, therefore, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) to draw the attention of the Government of Chile once again to the suggestion contained in its fourth report and cited in paragraph  (b) above;(ii) to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1952,Chile
