The Government adds that the name of Pedro Ortiz Larrechen - who according to the complainants disappeared after his arrest - does not appear in the register of arrested persons. The Government states that the medical attention for persons prosecuted in the military courts who require specialist attention is provided by the Central Hospital of the Armed Forces, a model hospital centre offering the services of the best specialists and full medical care, which is identical for both prisoners and military personnel and their families. The Government confirms the weak health of Hugo Rodriguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor and states that they are receiving proper medical attention with reference in particular to the last-mentioned person, the Government points out that this prisoner was examined in November  at the request of his family by the Argentinian doctor, Rene Favaloro, who in consultation with a medical team from the Central Hospital recorded a series of abnormalities which were believed to be operable. They recommended cardio-coronary examinations which were carried out on  January  with the following results: the aorta valve has biological prosthesis and severe paraprosthetic insufficiencies; an  per cent lesion of the first third of the coronary artery descending from behind with calibre open to two-thirds; and an insufficiency of the left ventricle with serious venocapillary and pulmonary hypertension. Since the prisoner in question, indicated in a note that he had decided not to be operated on before consulting the members of his family and his attending physician, the request for transfer was approved. Recently, with the consent of his treating physician and family, Mr. Altesor underwent a second operation from which he is presently recuperating. Lastly, the Government states that the permission to release Mr. Altesor ahead of time rests with the military courts.\n.Finally, in its communication of  November , the Government sends information on the majority of the persons mentioned in the list of detained persons sent by the CNT (see Annex). The Government states in particular that not all the persons referred to by the CNT are detained and that those who are detained have been tried in conformity with the law for illegal acts and not because of their trade union activities or their links with occupational organisations. The Government also gives the offences with which they were charged and sentenced.\n.The Committee notes that the complainants in the present case have made allegations concerning the arrest, prosecution or disappearance of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the state of health of other persons serving prison sentences and events which allegedly took place during the first assembly of the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay.\n.With regard to this last-mentioned point, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, no arrests or interrogations were made at this assembly. The Committee observes, however, that the complainants allege that the AEBU had to request authorisation from the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to hold the assembly and that the Government appears to confirm this in its statements. The Committee also notes that, according to the complainants, officials of', 'Techero and Felipe Vera, and that Carlos Tutzo, though he has not applied for an early release, will probably be released on  July .\n.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT, about whom the Committee had requested the Government to state the facts giving rise to their detention, trial or sentencing, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Ulises Pereira, Odilio Rovira and Benito Alvario have been released. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet supplied the information requested about the remaining  trade union leaders and trade unionists. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to supply this information as soon as possible.\n.As regards the allegation, subsequently denied by the WFTU, that the state of health of the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano had deteriorated as a result of the ill treatment received in prison and that he had died, the Committee notes that the Government invited various heads of diplomatic missions accredited in the country to visit the penitentiary in which Mr. Freire Pizzano is imprisoned and that these diplomats were able to verify the trade union leader\'s state of health and the conditions in which he is serving his sentence.\n.Concerning the allegations in connection with which the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of further developments, the Committee notes that the Government has ordered inquiries to be made in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz, that it will be informed of the outcome of the inquiries and that the application for the early release of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor is now under study by the Military Supreme Court. The Committee expresses the hope that, in view of this trade unionist\'s delicate state of health, the Count will decide on his early release shortly, and requests the Government to communicate the text of the decision taken. The committee also recalls that it requested the Government to take measures to secure the release of ten trade union leaders and trade unionists (Alberto Casas Rodriquez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson: Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt) and to inform it of any action taken in this respect. Since the Government has not supplied any information on the matter, the Committee can only reiterate its conclusions.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that certain trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CWT have been released and that another trade unionist will probably be released on  July .(b) The Committee requests the Government to explain, as soon as\' possible, the facts which gave rise to the trial, sentencing or detention of the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the attached list of detained persons supplied by the CNT.(c) The Committee notes that the trade union leader Ramn Freire Pizzano has not died and that, according to the Government, he is in perfect health at the penitentiary where he is serving his sentence.(d) The Committee notes that the Government has ordered inquiries to be made to ascertain the whereabouts of the dock worker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz and will inform the Committee of the outcome.(e) The Committee expresses the hope that, in view of the delicate state of health of the trade unionist Alberto Altesor, the Court will decide on his early release shortly. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of the decision taken.(f) The Committee again requests the Government to take measures to secure the release of the trade union leaders and trade unionists Alberto Casas Rodriguez, Daniel Uriarte Pintos, Gene Mateos Calvete, Nelson Cuello Camejo, Ramn Freire Pizzano, Armando Coronel Bez, Humberto Bonelli, Helvecio Bonelli Arias, Alberto Urruty Pizarro and Elbio Quinteros Bethancourt and to inform it of any action taken in this respect.\n.The complaints are contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the National Workers Convention of Uruguay (CNT) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated  December  and ,  and  January  respectively. The WFTU, the CNT and the ICFTU sent supplementary information in communications dated  February,  April and  August  respectively. The Government furnished its reply in communications dated  May,  October and  November .\n.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (NO. ).\n.The complainants allege that the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU), a trade union set up in accordance with the provisions of the Act respecting occupational associations and the decree regulating the application thereof was obliged to obtain permission from the Police Headquarters in Montevideo to organise its first assembly. The complainants add that, on  December , some participants of this assembly were apprehended by the police and subjected to interrogation, and that tape recordings were made of the proceedings and taken away by officials of the Ministry of the Interior.\n.The complainants also allege the arbitrary arrest by the police of Jos d\'Elia (President of the CNT), Carlos Gmez (ex-President of the AEBU and ex-Vice-President of the CNT), Bernardo Groisman (ex-leader of the Needleworkers Union), who have since been released, and the arrest of the trade unionists Luis Viera, Roberto Meirelles, Nicols Llad, Rubn Onelli Arias, Alberto Ortiz and Rubn Pereira.\n.The complainants further allege the arrest of Ramn Freire Pizzano (member of the National Board of the CNT), Elbio Quinteros (leader of the Municipal Workers and Employees Union of Montevideo), Helvecio Bonelli (leader of the Uruguayan Press Association and member of the National Board of the CNT), Alberto Urruty (local Committee delegate of the Omnibus Workers Organisation), Nelson Cuello (trade unionist working at the oil refinery of the State undertaking ANCAP), Gene Mateos Calvete (worker at the ANCAP oil refinery), Daniel Uriarte (member of the local trade union management board of ANCAP), Armando Coronel (member of the local Committee of public health), Alberto Casas Rodriguez (bank employee and trade union delegate at his workplace) and Umberto Bonelli (bank employee). According to the complainants, a statement from the Police Headquarters of Montevideo dated  January  maintained that this group was a trade union splinter of the Communist Party and accused the group of seeking to organise legal trade unions by drawing membership from workers who were not known to be communists which would enable the establishment of a legal movement secretly directed by the Communist Party and the revival of the CNT which had been declared illegal. The statement in question indicates that the ten persons were brought before a military court which tried them for offences committed under section  of the Military Penal Code (""Subversive Associations""), section (L)() in conjunction with section  (XII) of the Constitution (""Conspiracy against the Constitution followed by preparatory acts"") and section  (IV) of the Military Penal Code """"Assistance to illegal associations""). The complainants go on to allege that the political and ideological repression of all opponents of the Government extends to the trade union movement and in this way the police can accuse a group of workers of belonging to any ""antinational"", ""subversive"" ideology if they commit the so-called ""crime"" of trying to organise legal trade unions and it may bring them before a military court.\n.Furthermore, the CNT encloses a list of trade union leaders and trade unionists who are currently in prison (see Annex), and the WFTU points out that since the promulgation of the decree regulating the Act respecting occupational associations, approximately  trade unionists have disappeared, including the dockworker trade unionist Pedro Ortiz subsequent to his arrest.\n.Finally, the complainants point out that some trade union leaders and trade unionists who are serving prison sentences in the ""Libertad"" penitentiary are seriously ill and refer in particular to Hugo Rodrguez, Jos Pedro Mrquez and Alberto Altesor. The family of the last-mentioned prisoner has requested his transfer to Argentina to undergo a medical operation.\n.In a further communication dated  August , the ICFTU states that Mr. Altesor was allowed to undergo a heart operation, attended by his own doctor, in July . The operation was successful and his health is now improving. The ICFTU requests that he be released from detention on humanitarian grounds.\n.In its communication dated  May , the Government states that the fact that it is sending information on the various complaints does not imply its recognition of the legal capacity of those who claim to be spokesmen of the ""National Workers Convention of Uruguay"", an association which was declared illegal by the Government on  June  because of its activities unrelated to trade unionism', 'Techero and Felipe Vera, and that Carlos Tutzo, though he has not applied for an early release, will probably be released on  July .\n.As regards the  trade union leaders and trade unionists mentioned in the list of detained persons supplied by the CNT, about whom the Committee had requested the Government to state the facts giving rise to their detention, trial or sentencing, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Ulises Pereira, Odilio Rovira and Benito Alvario have been released.

() article  of the Act, which provides for the compulsory extension of the term of a collective agreement until substituted by a new agreement, constitutes interference in free collective bargaining; () article  relating to the functioning of wages councils is not in conformity with the principles of collective bargaining when it establishes that decisions of these councils only take effect when registered and published by the Executive Power; and () this Act provides for intervention and interference by the authorities in violation of Conventions Nos  and , which gave rise to the observation of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its observation on the application by Uruguay of Convention No. .\n.The Committee notes that the Government states that in general: () when the administration took office, the labour relations scene was dismal, minimum wages were appalling, collective bargaining hardly existed and freedom of association was suppressed; () the legislation contained flagrant contraventions of international Conventions and, for example, rural workers and domestic workers did not have a limited working day nor the right to bargaining in wages councils; () the wages councils were not convened after , and there were less than  company-only collective agreements which covered less than  per cent of the total workforce; () between ' , numerous collective agreements were signed on terms which diminished workers' rights, and when the new Government took office in , one of its first measures was to establish wages councils; () from  to , these bodies had not been convened, despite the fact that the Act which created them was fully in force and the employers' sector had never lodged a complaint; () the wages councils are tripartite bodies whose chief responsibility is to set minimum wages by branch of activity and category, but they also have other powers such as to act as conciliation bodies in the case of collective disputes, fix wage increases for the remaining workers, etc.; () as a first step, the Higher Tripartite Council was set up, and then  activity groups were organized which in turn established subgroups;( ) a framework for discussion was established in the public sector, which reached a framework agreement and by consensus a law on collective bargaining for the public sector and a wages council was set up for domestic or homeworkers, which culminated in a collective agreement; and () three bargaining rounds took place, over  per cent of all collective agreements were reached unanimously, and there was a significant rise in real wages.\n.More specifically, with regard to the text of the Act, the Committee notes that the Government states that: () the bargaining system is structured at three levels (national scope; branch of activity or productive chain; and bipartite collective bargaining at company or group of companies level); () at the first level, a governing body is established, with functions of governance of labour relations, called the Higher Tripartite Council, at the second level, bargaining is structured by branch of activity and the bargaining takes place in wages councils, and at the third level, classic collective bargaining takes place (the most prominent feature of which is that it is bipartite); () article  of the new Act is important in that it establishes that lower bargaining levels may not diminish the minimum provisions adopted at a higher bargaining level, except as agreed in the respective wages council; () the right to information set out in article  stems from the right to negotiate in good faith and is extensively developed in ILO Recommendation No. , and partially reproduces ILO Recommendation No. , establishing mechanisms for exchange of information and consultations, and including the obligation of secrecy (the majority of trade unions at branch of activity level do have legal personality, thus if it is sought to take action against them for civil liability, there would be no obstacles from the point of national positive law; () the creation of the Higher Tripartite Council did not signify any intervention, but enacts in law a body created by the Executive Power which has functioned on a tripartite basis in wage bargaining rounds since  (the Government refers to the historical evolution of wages councils in the country); () the complainants are confusing collective bargaining with labour relations when they assert that the Council would have to take a governing role in collective bargaining in all its dimensions, forgetting that collective bargaining is by definition bipartite, free and voluntary; () under article , at the second collective bargaining level, wages councils are responsible for fixing the minimum amount of wages and conditions of work for all workers in the private sector and at the third level, collective bargaining is bipartite and free and has all the characteristics of collective autonomy; () as regards the alleged imbalance of representatives on the Council, they show that they are not familiar with the way in which the major ILO organs function, where delegations do not have the same number of delegates by sector; () the convocation to wages councils fulfils the obligation to fix minimum wages, in accordance with Convention No. ; () the decision that in company collective bargaining, in the absence of a workers' organization, bargaining authority passes to the most representative higher level organization arises because in Uruguay almost all companies are micro-, small or medium-sized enterprises and trade unions are essentially organized not at company level but by branch of activity; () as regards the criticism that administrative checks to test representativeness and consultation are missing, the criteria used are in line with those established by the ILO, but may be the subject of regulations in the future.\n.The Committee welcomes the Government s aim of promoting collective bargaining, increased coverage of collective agreements and the number of agreements. With regard to the content of the Act, the Committee formulates the following comments on the articles which may raise problems of conformity with the principles of collective bargaining or which warrant interpretation in accordance with those principles:I. with respect to the exchange of information necessary to allow the normal conduct of the process of collective bargaining and that in the case of confidential information, its communication carries the implicit obligation of secrecy, and breach thereof would give rise to civil liability of those who are in breach (article ), the Committee considers that all the parties to the negotiation, whether or not they have legal personality, must be liable for any breaches of the right to secrecy of the information which they receive in the framework of collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that this principle is respected;II. as regards the composition of the Higher Tripartite Council (article ), the Committee considers that an equal number of members could be taken into account for each of the three sectors, and also the appointment of an independent chairperson, preferably nominated by the workers' and employers' organizations jointly, who could break the deadlock in the event of a vote. The Committee requests the Government to hold discussions with the social partners on the modification of the law so as to arrive at a negotiated solution to the number of members of the Council;III. with respect to the powers of the Higher Tripartite Council and in particular considering and pronouncing on questions related to the tripartite and bipartite bargaining levels (article , paragraph (d)), the Committee has emphasized on many occasions that  the determination of the bargaining level is essentially a matter to be left to the discretion of the parties'  [See Digest of the decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. .] The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures including the amendment of existing legislation to ensure that the bargaining level is established by the parties and is not subject to voting in a tripartite body;IV. as regards the possibility of wages councils establishing conditions of work for each case to be agreed by the employers' and workers' delegates in the respective wage group (article ), the Committee recalls, firstly, that under ILO standards, the fixing of minimum wages may be subject to decisions by tripartite bodies. On the other hand, recalling that it is up to the legislative authority to determine the legal minimum standards for conditions of work and that Article  of Convention No.  seeks to promote bipartite bargaining to fix conditions of work, the Committee hopes that in application of those principles, any collective agreement on fixing of conditions of employment will be the result of an agreement between the parties, as the article in question appears to envisage;V. with respect to the subject of bipartite collective bargaining and, in particular, that in company collective bargaining where"", ""uncertainty of government policy.\n.The Government indicates that another of the allegations is the criticism of the Act based on the false dichotomy of dirigisme nterventionism versus free and voluntary negotiation. The Government indicates that this is a false comparison. The State must, on some occasions, intervene in the system of labour relations (bearing in mind that to fail to do so, as did previous governments, is also a form of intervention which can be called inaction) to ensure fulfilment of workers' fundamental human rights, for example, respect for freedom of association, the right of collective bargaining, moral conscience, private life, right to limits on working time, etc. Many of these rights are grounded in the Constitution of the Republic itself; others in international obligations assumed by the Uruguayan State, for example, with the ILO. Intervention may also fall into a third category; i.e. creating legislation and conditions to foster the promotion of freedom of association, collective bargaining, the right to organize, etc. First, by constitutional mandate and secondly, by taking a decision and adopting a policy which finds in this system healthy, constructive and strong labour relations. One such obligation is to fix minimum wages for workers, with periodic adjustments and as far as possible to allow workers, employers and the State itself to participate on an equal footing.\n.At the second level of collective bargaining (article  and following), it is established that wages councils shall comply with these international obligations, as they are responsible for  fixing the minimum amount of wages and conditions of work of all workers in the private sector ...'  The third level establishes bipartite collective bargaining (article  and following), where bargaining is free, voluntary and has the characteristics of collective autonomy. The Government considers that it is therefore tendentious and reflects an erroneous interpretation, aimed at confusing the Committee, to assert that in all cases where a bilateral agreement is not reached (typical collective agreement), wage councils will resort to wage fixing. Bilateral collective bargaining, i.e. classic collective agreements will continue, as they do now, to be free and voluntary, but in the matter of fixing minimum wages, when there is no agreement, when the bargaining in a branch of activity fails or in the absence of a collective bargaining framework, the State will convene the wages councils, which are tripartite bodies, to fix minimum wages and thus comply with Article  of ILO Convention No. .\n.The Government indicates that, the comments that the decisions of the Council will not be properly balanced because the Government has more representatives than the professional sectors, shows that they are not familiar with or reject the way in which the major ILO organs function, where delegations do not have the same number of delegates by sector. In general, the State has twice as many as the professional sectors.\n.As regards the objections to Chapter III, that the convocation to wages councils is in violation of free and voluntary bargaining, the Government states that the Bill, on the one hand, provides for classic collective bargaining, and on the other hand, through the socalled atypical collective bargaining, fulfils the obligation to fix minimum wages, in accordance with Convention No. . The proposed wording clearly draws on the abovementioned international instrument, thereby overcoming the observation that has been made against the country by the ILO s own supervisory bodies (Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference) which had repeatedly pointed out that the provisions of the Convention concerned were not being applied, because the public authorities were not consulting the most representative workers' organizations in the case of establishing, applying and modifying minimum wages.\n.Furthermore, the collective bargaining that takes place in the wages councils continues to be free and voluntary. Although the State convenes the parties to this sphere of bargaining, it does so in order to fix minimum wages and their modifications. The professional organizations are free not to participate, but if they do not do so, they are the ones who fail to take advantage of or recognize this space for negotiation and consultation. In that case, the State can fix minimum wages without listening to them because they did not attend, or listening to only one of the parties. Attending wages councils does not involve an obligation to agree, as was said in the rounds that took place from  to now, where the percentage of unanimity was over  per cent and those agreed by a majority,  per cent. In the remaining average of  per cent where there was no form of agreement, the State made orders setting the minimum wages, but after having been present throughout the bargaining round, mediating to try and reach agreement. In this way, it fulfilled its obligation to fix minimum wages and create mechanisms for collective bargaining and consultation. The curious thing about the whole of this complaint is that the employers are apparently opposed to the way the system of wages councils operated, yet at local level they demanded vehemently to be involved in them and, when the moment of the bargaining reached an overwhelming majority, they signed collective agreements in those bodies.\n.As regards the objections to Chapter IV on bipartite collective bargaining, and specifically the objection to the provisions that one of the defects lies in company collective bargaining ' .. in the absence of a workers' organization, bargaining authority passes to the most representative higher level organization ...'  The Government explains that it arises because in Uruguay almost all companies are micro-, small or medium-sized enterprises. Trade unions are essentially organized not at company level but by branch of activity. In other words, the workers join this branch union, because there is no union in their company. Thus there are a great many federations, such as the Commercial and Industrial Workers' Federation of Uruguay (FUECI), the Federation of Beverage Sector Workers (FOEB) and the Uruguayan Health Federation (FUS). That is why, historically, collective bargaining in the country has basically been by branch of activity. It also means that the collective interests of workers in a company who belong to a branch trade union may be represented by that organization.\n.As regards the other criticism that  administrative checks to test representativeness and consultation are missing'  the Government states that the criteria used are in line with those established by the ILO itself. However, the criticism may be addressed in the regulations which will undoubtedly ensue from the Act. As regards Chapter V on prevention and resolution of disputes, the Government reiterates that articles '  on occupations of workplaces were excluded from the Bill by decision of the President of the Republic, as duly communicated to the employers and announced to the public.\n.Lastly, the Government states that the complaint is based on assumptions that can be clearly seen as untrue and fallacious. To deny that social dialogue and tripartism exist in Uruguay is to deny reality, or perhaps it is to seek to confuse those who need to understand the situation. For  years, wages councils were not convened, with the obvious consequences for workers' wages, which undoubtedly had an effect on social values. The impoverishment of the workers undermined the social fabric, concentrating wealth in a few sectors, increasing levels of informal work and weakening the unionized social actor.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that although it had already sent its observations concerning the case, it considered it of crucial importance to explain the reasons why the Government was delayed in formulating its observations. The Committee on Freedom of Association in its th Report, relating to the th Session held in November , made an urgent call to the Government, as at the time it still had not received the requested information. In this regard and bearing in mind that the Government has always endeavoured to submit a prompt reply to cases raised, it wishes to express with respect to the present case that it relates to a Collective Bargaining Bill submitted to the national Parliament in October , which since then has been the subject of various amendments.\n.Among these amendments, special mention should be made of the undertaking given by the President of the Republic to withdraw articles ' , which refer to occupations of workplaces, from the original Bill; a commitment made to the employers' sector and the public, in that it was communicated to the national press, and was in turn transmitted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to the parliamentary authorities, the employers and the various media. In addition, as regards the parliamentary processing of the Bill, it should be mentioned that it was analysed by the Committee on Labour Legislation in the Chamber of Representatives (item No.  of ) and by the Committee of Labour Affairs and Social Security in the Senate (item No.  of ), after hearing representations from the Merchant"", ""consultation.\n.When it refers to the duration of the collective agreement in its article , the Bill provides that  a collective agreement whose term has expired shall remain fully in force with respect to all its clauses until substituted by a new agreement'  In this regard, we must recall that, as the Committee has said, any extension of collective agreements should be following tripartite analysis of the ensuing consequences for the sector to which it applies.\n.As regards Chapter V on prevention and settlement of disputes, the complainants state that articles '  are clearly in violation of international Conventions signed by Uruguay (these articles refer to the occupation of the workplace during a strike; these articles were withdrawn by the Government).\n.The complainant organizations indicate that, in short, the Bill does not enshrine a system, but a set of laws which partially regulate certain aspects in favour of only one of the parties. They assert that the Bill in question contains deliberate omissions: it regulates only workers' rights, but does not subject them to obligations of any nature or kind, it does not refer to employers' rights, it gives legal status to a manifestly unlawful action which violates rights enshrined in the Constitution, and it confers on the Executive Power a maximum degree of intervention in collective bargaining between employers and workers. All of this ultimately gives rise to dangerous imbalances in the system, and one-sided and thus arbitrary solutions. In conclusion, the complainants consider that the Government is acting on the fringes of what is lawful in contravention of the provisions of the international Conventions to which it is a party, namely Conventions Nos , ,  and .\n.In their communication of  October , the complainant organizations report the approval on  August  by the national Parliament, of the Collective Bargaining Act, which is the subject of this case. They draw the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association to the failure by the Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay to fulfil the obligations it assumed when it ratified Conventions Nos , ,  and , by passing the Bill which is the subject of the case.\n.The complainants state that the recently passed Act, despite certain specific changes introduced in it, is in flagrant breach of the international Conventions signed by Uruguay. They state that, as has been explained, there were no  discussions' that were  free'   detailed'  in  good faith'  in a  framework of trust' and  mutual respect' with  sufficient time to express their points of view and discuss them in depth with a view to reaching a satisfactory compromise' \n.The Bill passed by Parliament and promulgated by the Executive Power as Act No.  enshrines direct intervention by the Government in collective bargaining in accordance with the articles described below. Article  of the Act creates the Higher Tripartite Council as the  body responsible for the coordination and governance of labour relations'  With regard to its composition, the Act provides that the Council shall consist of nine delegates of the Executive Power, six of the most representative employers' organizations and six of the most representative workers' organizations.\n.According to the complainants, the above warrants the following considerations. Firstly, it is a body which will interfere directly ( coordination and governance'  in the principal aspect of labour relations, which is collective bargaining. Secondly, the greater number of delegates from the Executive Power ensures that, in nominal voting, decisions will be in accordance with the interests and vision of the Government. Indeed, article  establishes an absolute majority of members, in which the sectors do not have equal representation with the Government. This is unquestionably a violation of tripartism, the guiding principle of the ILO.\n.One of the most worrying aspects for the complainant organizations, however, is that the Council has an ex officio power of convocation which allied to the quorum, transforms it into a powerful executing agency of the policies which the Government wishes to implement. Notwithstanding the above, special attention should be paid to article  which refers to the powers of the Council. The complainant organizations indicate that special consideration should be given to paragraphs (d) and (e). Indeed, paragraph (d) provides that the Council s powers will include  to consider and pronounce on questions relating to tripartite and bipartite bargaining levels'  In addition, paragraph (e) provides that it may  study and adopt initiatives on subjects which it considers pertinent to promote consultation, bargaining and the development of labour relations' \n.The concern of the complainant organizations is that the new body will be able to decide on any question related to bargaining levels and adopt initiatives to develop labour relations. As conceived, with the ex officio right of convocation, the greater number of delegates of the Executive Power, nominal voting, and powers defined in a broad, ambiguous, confused and ill-defined manner, this is undoubtedly a case of a body whose objective is clear: state intervention and dirigisme in labour affairs and collective bargaining. It thereby violates the autonomy of the actors and parties and the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. . In a nutshell, moreover, the provisions of the abovementioned articles are contrary to the many pronouncements of the Committee on Freedom of Association which establish that public authorities must refrain from interfering to limit the right of the parties to free negotiation.\n.Article  of the Act provides that  a collective agreement whose term has expired shall remain fully in force with respect to all its clauses until substituted by a new agreement'  It is clear from this that it establishes a compulsory extension of the term of collective agreements, which is an interference in free collective bargaining. In article , when it refers to tripartite wages councils, whose functioning, according to a report of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference , has been the subject of observation, it provides that  decisions of wages councils shall take effect for the respective group of activity once they have been registered and published by the Executive Power'  The requirement of publication for an agreement to enter into force is not fully in conformity with the principles of voluntary negotiation established in Convention No. , as the Committee has stated clearly.\n.Most importantly, however, is that this Act ultimately enshrines something that was precisely a reason for observation by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  when it examined the application by Uruguay of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). According to the complainants, the observation of the Committee of Experts acquires special relevance since it was in response to the considerations of the Government itself. In short, the Act ultimately enshrines intervention and interference by the public authorities in clear violation of the abovementioned international Conventions. In conclusion, according to the complainant organizations, the Collective Bargaining Act passed by the national Parliament constitutes a violation of those Conventions.\n.In its communication of  December , the Government states that it must respond to the complainant proceeding filed by the IOE, the CIU and the CNCS for alleged violations of Conventions Nos , ,  and . The Government states that the focus of the complaint is linked to the Collective Bargaining Bill submitted by the Executive Power to the national Parliament and that the complainant organizations consider that the process of amending Uruguayan labour legislation, which began in , took place with total disregard of the employers' sector or their contributions, and thus in an absence of tripartism and social dialogue.\n.The Government states that it will demonstrate the lack of justification of the action, and the eventual benefits of the Bill which, as is natural in any democratic process, was subject to countless amendments from its submission to its final approval by the national Parliament, which is a crucible of all the political forces in the country and where the various sectors were invited to expound their positions.\n.The Government indicates that, before analysing the Bill, a clarification must be made which the complainants omitted to mention. Namely, the President of the Republic gave an undertaking to the employers' sector and the public (in that it was communicated to the press) to withdraw articles ' ; i.e. those which referred to occupation of workplaces, from the original Bill. In addition, the Minister of Labour and Social Security conveyed that decision on more than one occasion to the parliamentary authorities (Committee on Labour Legislation of the Chamber of Deputies), several meetings with employers and the press in general. Consequently, the employers (by which we mean exclusively the CIU and the CNCS) should not have omitted to mention that information to the Committee. It does not seem an appropriate practice for a proceeding governed by principles so dear to democratic institutions and justice as good faith and fairness.\n.In""]"

The motive for the DGES decision was the improper justification of union leave, grossly exceeding the hours allocated to the union for each official on the basis of the number of union members. The Government indicates that FENAPES applied to the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) for the act to be revoked and possibly declared null and void, and so no final ruling has yet been issued and the DGES may revoke it wholly or partially.\n.The Government adds that this situation is also being dealt with in a tripartite collective bargaining body. The Government explains that in the complaint FENAPES does not allege non-compliance on the part of these bodies towards itself but only refers to those relating to the ATES, citing the refusal of the Director-General for Secondary Education, but omitting to mention that it was the verbal aggression against the Director-General committed by the ATES president in a tripartite body which caused the temporary suspension of the negotiations. The Government indicates that the union did not request bipartite or tripartite meetings until March , when the negotiations were launched.\n.In general terms, the Government affirms that, far from finding the actions of the public education authorities to be a violation of the international and national standards which protect freedom of association, these authorities have properly discharged their powers and duties, both in investigating the liability that might have been incurred by the union or any of its members in violating the  law of the land' which Convention No.  requires to be respected, and in putting into practice common-sense rules for the use of trade union leave. The Government emphasizes that the administrative proceedings which were initiated (administrative investigations and summary proceedings) were based on actual proven facts and are regulated by the standards and principles of the rule of law itself, and that all decisions can be challenged through administrative appeals, and that there is judicial control of all such administrative activity.\n.The Government emphasizes that the Constitution does not exempt unions of officials (established under article  of the Constitution) from the restriction established in article  stating that:  In workplaces and during working hours, any activity unrelated to official duties shall be prohibited, and any activity for propaganda purposes of any kind shall be deemed unlawful.' It also indicates that although the complainants refer to a  public media campaign against FENAPES'  there has not been a single press release aimed at undermining the trade union or encouraging public rejection of it. The Government affirms that FENAPES continues to fully exercise freedom of association, freely organizing its union activity, and all that is required of it is full respect for the provisions of applicable law and agreements.\n.The Committee notes the allegation of the complainant organizations in the present complaint that since the change of government in March  the education authorities, in particular the Directorate-General for Secondary Education (DGES) (formerly the Secondary Education Board (CES)) at the National Public Education Administration (ANEP) placed various limitations on the trade union activities of the National Federation of Secondary School Teachers (FENAPES), the most representative organization in the sphere of public secondary education, and its activists. The Committee notes that the Government denies that there has been any anti-union persecution, asserts that the ANEP has always been open to dialogue, and that what is being denounced as an attack on freedom of association is merely the requirement for the country s legal order to be respected. The Government indicates that the DGES exercised the legitimate powers conferred on it by law and that at no time was trade union activity investigated but the conduct of officials bound to the Administration by a set of regulations governing their conduct.\n.The Committee notes the complainants' allegation that the anti-union policy expressed itself through a series of incidents that took place in different parts of the country and are described below:\n.The Committee notes the complainants' allegation that as a result of complaints made by the principals of the high schools to the DGES between late  and early  for alleged violations of the guiding principles of education (secularism and prohibition of propaganda), the DGES conducted a series of disciplinary investigations without safeguards involving trade union leaders, who were penalized for their views, resulting in an environment of public censure of the activists. The Committee notes that the investigations involving the three high schools were concerned with the participation of FENAPES leaders in activities of an allegedly union nature and were related to a plebiscite on constitutional reform relating to issues of public safety and a referendum on a law entitled the Urgent Consideration Act (LUC).\n.The Committee notes the Government s indication that the investigations relating to activities carried out in the high schools in Canelones and Montevideo (in the latter case, a number of teachers featured in the investigations, regardless of whether or not they were union members) were closed since no liability on the part of any official was established.\n.With regard to San Jos High School No. , the Committee observes that the investigation by the DGES focused on teachers and trade union leaders who took photos of each other inside and outside the school, during the evening, with banners indicating their rejection of the constitutional reform related to public safety. The Committee notes that while the complainants indicate that the union activists took care to exercise their right of expression outside the school premises and without the presence of students, the Government indicates that the photos were taken when evening classes were in progress. The Committee observes that the complainants emphasize, among other things, that the DGES conducted the investigation without granting the teachers the right of defence and that it culminated with a report which omits to mention the union nature of the activity and condemns the exercise of free speech with respect to a topic which had generated intense public debate since it included aspects of major social interest. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s indication that the constitutional reform had nothing to do with trade union rights or public education but was related to issues of public safety, it affirms that the public servants enjoyed the guarantees of due process and that there was no anti-union persecution, and it emphasizes that what was investigated was not union activity but actions by teachers as public servants in breach of constitutional standards, in particular article , which bans propaganda/proselytism.\n.The Committee notes the complainants' and the Government s indications that: (i) the investigations of the persons who took photos of each other on the public thoroughfare near the school were concluded without establishing any liability (since it was demonstrated that no administrative infringement had been committed); (ii) the proposal to dismiss the teachers who had taken photos inside the school was dropped; and (iii) a sanction of  days' suspension with deduction of pay was imposed. The Committee notes that, according to the Government s information, none of the sanctioned teachers appealed the sanctions.\n.The Committee notes that the complainants also allege that in  the ANEP issued a decision demanding that FENAPES remove banners relating to the campaign against the LUC which were on the facade of different high schools. The Committee notes that although the complainants indicate that they reported this incident to an impartial parliamentary body (INDDHH), which recommended that the most controversial sections of the decision should be removed, the Government indicates that the decision was based on defence of the principle of secularism and explains that it did not order the removal of the banners located  in the vicinity' of the high schools but only those that were on the facades. It also indicates that the ANEP is not dependent on the INDDHH and that it brought invalidation proceedings in the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) but these have not yet been settled. The Committee notes that the Government has annexed a copy of a judgement issued in June  concerning an amparo action that ordered the ANEP to prohibit the placement of posters (on that occasion put up by students) relating to the constitutional reform on public safety issues or with similar content on the facade of any other of its buildings. The Committee also notes FENAPES' indication that it brought another complaint before the INDDHH relating to other situations such as the ban on holding union meetings on school premises. The Committee has no further information regarding this other complaint.\n.The Committee observes that article  of the Constitution of Uruguay promotes the organization of trade unions and article  provides that public officials are in the service of the nation and not of any political faction, and that in workplaces and during working hours any activity unrelated to official duties shall be prohibited, and any kind of activity for propaganda purposes shall be deemed unlawful. The Committee notes that while the complainants consider that a coherent interpretation of"", ""articles  and  of the Constitution suggests that article  bans political propaganda while article  places trade union activities under the protection of that ban, the Government emphasizes that propaganda of any kind is prohibited by article  and the prohibition cannot be circumvented by invoking freedom of expression or trade union rights. The Government also indicates that when a teacher in public education engages in propaganda, this entails a twofold infringement: of the legal provision that bans propaganda, and of the provision prescribing that teaching shall be carried out in accordance with the principle of secularism (section  of the General Education Act and section  of the EFD Teaching Staff Regulations).\n.The Committee notes that it is clear from the above-mentioned details that: (i) six members or trade union leaders of FENAPES were sanctioned with six months' suspension with deduction of pay for having taken and then disseminated photos in a high school to express their opposition to a constitutional reform concerning public safety issues; and (ii) the public administration had ordered the removal banners put up in various high schools in relation to a referendum on a law, which contained, inter alia, provisions relating to the exercise of the right to strike. The Committee notes that, in both cases, the Government considers that the duty of neutrality and impartiality of teachers vis--vis students was violated and that, in the first case, the referendum in question concerned a constitutional reform totally unrelated to the interests of the trade union and its members. The Committee notes that FENAPES, for its part, considers that the activities in question were fully within the scope of trade union activity and should have therefore been protected.\n.The Committee recalls that freedom of opinion and expression constitutes one of the basic civil liberties essential for the normal expression of trade union rights and that in a previous case it requested a government to ensure that public officials' trade unions have the possibility to express their views publicly on the wider economic and social policy questions which have a direct impact on their members' interests [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee takes note of the substantial nature of the sanctions imposed on the members or trade union leaders of FENAPES for having taken and then disseminated photos in a high school to express their opposition to a constitutional reform, and stresses the importance that they be effectively proportional to the offences committed so that in the future they do not have a deterrent effect on the action of trade union organizations in situations that involve the defence of their members' interests. Likewise, in relation to the two cases referred to above, the Committee considers that a reasonable balance should be established between the obligation of political neutrality of public teachers in the educational field established by the Constitution of Uruguay and the right of teachers' organizations to express their opinions on economic and social policy questions that may affect their members and to be able to disseminate them in the workplace, bearing in mind the need not to impair the education of the children. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the existence of such a balance and to take any necessary action in this regard. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the invalidation proceedings brought in the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) relating to the removal of banners from the schools' facades, and also of the status of the other complaint filed by FENAPES with the INDDHH relating to the ban on holding union meetings on school premises.\n.The Committee notes the complainants' allegation that since the change of government a number of hostile actions were recorded calling into question the use of trade union leave by FENAPES, referring to two specific incidents: (i) a complaint made by the principal of High School No.  to the DGES concerning the excessive use of hours for union activity, which resulted in the DGES conducting an investigation into the hours used by the teacher and FENAPES leader Mr Marcel Slamovitz for union activity; and (ii) the setting up of a parliamentary commission to investigate the granting and justification of irregular leave for FENAPES members by the CES during the '  period (in order to establish whether or not an appropriate legal basis had been used to justify the hours for union activity ' in particular, the use of section . of the Teaching Staff Regulations (EFD) to justify hours of union leave).\n.With regard to Mr Slamovitz, the Committee notes the allegations that: (i) the DGES ordered the suspension of this teacher from his post for  days with total deduction of pay for gross misconduct on account of the use of  trade union power' to mislead the school principal; and (ii) in the context of the investigation it was decided to file a criminal complaint against this teacher and other FENAPES leaders, seeking possible criminalization of the union leaders' conduct for issuing and using false records of union activity in the context of agreements concluded with the authorities at that time. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s indication that: (i) the more than  absences in two years led the school principal to contact the CES to obtain more details of the certificates used to justify such absences; (ii) the investigation was conducted under the guarantees of due process and determined the existence of gross administrative misconduct for using  trade union power' to mislead the school principal; and (iii) every public official has the duty to report the existence of circumstances that appear to be criminal and to bring them to the attention of the justice system so that the latter can investigate and resolve them.\n.The Committee observes that, according to the complaint and the Government s reply, FENAPES issued  records' of trade union activity to present to the school principals, requesting  justification of the absence' of the official in accordance with section . of the Teaching Staff Regulations (EFD). The Committee observes that said section refers to extraordinary leave of teaching staff that  is granted for special tasks or services entrusted by the Central Board of Directors, by the respective Boards or required by other state agencies, in compliance with express legal provisions'  The Committee observes that the complainants affirm that: (i) a non-written agreement had been duly concluded between FENAPES and the previous authorities to justify any hours for union activity in excess of those specified by agreement by invoking section . of the EFD; (ii) there are no formalities of any kind in Uruguayan law that require that an agreement must be in writing, whether in the public or private sphere, and (iii) customary compliance with the terms of an agreement also contributes to the understanding that an agreement exists even if not in writing. The Committee observes that, for its part, the Government indicates that: (i) when the school principals accepted the excess hours taken by the delegates as free time for union activity, they did so on the basis of a misleading record issued by the union, which induced justification of the absences through reference to an agreement (whose existence could not be proven) with the indication (supposedly backed up by the non-existent agreement) that the absence was covered by section . of the EFD (which has nothing to do with union leave); (ii) the DGES considered that it was not legally possible that the former authorities could have agreed that section . of the EFD was applicable to justify the excessive use of hours for union activity, since that would have violated the statutory regulations and exceeded the scope of their competencies; (iii) it is inconceivable that there could have been a verbal agreement on this matter since one of the parties was the State; and (iv) the regulation of trade union leave arises from the agreement signed between CODICEN and the Coordinating Committee of Uruguayan Teaching Unions (CSEU), embodied in Resolution No.  of Record No.  dated  December , which establishes year by year the ceiling on the number of hours corresponding to trade union leave and this agreement makes no reference to the use of section . of the EFD to justify trade union leave.\n.With regard to the parliamentary commission, the Committee notes that while the complainants indicate that there was unlawful conduct with the clear intention of persecution and condemnation of freedom of association, the collective bargaining process between FENAPES and the CES of that time having been called into question, the Government indicates that the commission neither acted illegally nor sought to interfere in trade union autonomy or in the collective bargaining process, nor was there any attempt at criminalization, but that it investigated the actions of public officials who, beyond the hours of leave for trade union activity, made use of leave"", ""by public officials which contravened constitutional standards, that the officials concerned enjoyed guarantees of due process and that the proposed sanction of dismissal was rejected by the education authorities. The Government points out that the Administration has the duty to investigate any act that may constitute a violation of the regulations and for which professional liability can be incurred, and that having established the existence of an administrative infringement and having identified those responsible, the disciplinary powers of the Administration came into play. In this regard, the Government states that the action of the ANEP through the decentralized DGES did not involve any violation of freedom of association, or any restriction of freedom of expression, but was in line with the duties imposed by the Constitution and the law to avoid any kind of propaganda and to preserve secularism in education. The Government indicates that the proceedings were concluded with a decision issued by the DGES, whereby a sanction was imposed on the teachers of  days' suspension with deduction of pay, the period of suspension already served during the proceedings being subtracted. The Government emphasizes that there was no anti-union persecution or any selective dismissal aimed at penalizing the union members, but that the stages of the proceedings were followed whose purpose is to provide guarantees, not to penalize or persecute, and are covered by the legal provisions in force. The Government informs that none of the sanctioned teachers appealed the sanctions. The Government also indicates that the files relating to the officials who took photos outside the school, on the public thoroughfare, were archived once it had been established that no administrative infringement had been committed.\n.The Government indicates that although a trade union has the right to define measures that it will adopt with regard to any event or occurrence, whether political, cultural or otherwise, in this case the teachers took photos of each other inside the school, which is their workplace, and article  of the Constitution provides that:  In workplaces and during working hours, any activity unrelated to official duties shall be prohibited, and any kind of activity for propaganda purposes shall be deemed unlawful. Groups may not be formed for propaganda purposes by using the titles of public agencies or invoking any link with official duties in the context of membership of such groups'  Propaganda is strictly forbidden under article  of the Constitution and freedom of expression or trade union rights cannot be invoked in order to circumvent the prohibition. Any propaganda engaged in by teachers in public education constitutes a twofold infringement: of the legal provisions banning propaganda, and of the provision that orders teaching to be carried out in accordance with the principle of secularism (section  of the General Education Act and section  of the EFD). The Government stresses that this case involves public officials governed by a set of regulations; that it is not about teachers being denied the possibility of expressing themselves; the issue is that they did so inside the school in various offices and during working hours since evening classes were in progress at that time and that the constitutional reform in question. had no connection with trade union rights or with public education regulations but was related to the subject of public safety in Uruguay.\n.The Government indicates that: (i) the Schools Inspectorate informed the CES that the students at the school had used scarves with the slogan  No to the constitutional reform' while participating in union meetings inside the school, and it noted a violation of the right of freedom and of the principle of secularism and indicated that the students did not have the authorization of the school management required under the terms of the Student Regulations (in force since ); (ii) the CES Legal Division agreed with the suggestion of the Schools Inspectorate that, in line with the regulations in force, an administrative investigation should be conducted in order to elucidate the facts, but no element emerged that amounted to anti-union persecution or reprisals of any sort with regard to FENAPES members, an organization which does not represent the students; and (iii) the administrative investigation was closed without any liability having been established on the part of any official (DGES decision of  February ).\n.The Government indicates that: (i) the school management reported to the DGES that on  March  material was found referring to the Urgent Consideration Act (LUC) (promulgated on  July ) inside the registration office on the upper floor of the school (leaflets concerning a political campaign for the collection of signatures aimed at the repeal of the Act, which has nothing to do with union rights); (ii) the DGES, following the suggestion of the Legal Division, ordered the opening of an investigation to determine the facts and apportion responsibility; (iii) the action of the DGES was in line with the law and upheld all the principles that govern public education; and (iv) a number of teachers, regardless of whether they were union members, featured in the investigation, which was closed without any liability having been established on the part of any official (DGES decision of  December ).\n.The Government also mentions that banners referring to the campaign against the LUC were placed on the facade of the school and an order was given to remove the banners from the facade but not to remove the banners located in the vicinity of this or any other school, this being done to defend the principle of secularism, the preservation of which does not affect freedom of expression or freedom of association. The Government indicates that recital (VI) of CODICEN decision states as follows:  There is no intention to violate or restrict the legitimate right to use trade union noticeboards, nor to limit, restrict, violate or interfere with the exercise of freedom'  The Government has annexed a copy of an amparo [protection of constitutional rights] judgment handed down in  (the Government points out that at that time the authorities of the ANEP were different, appointed by the Government prior to the one that took office in March ) and which obliges the ANEP to remove proselytising/propaganda banners from the facades of its premises. In this judgment, the Administrative Court of First Instance indicated that the banners had a clear political message that undoubtedly constituted proselytising activity and that the banners violated neutrality. Based on the above, the Court ordered the ANEP to prohibit the placement of banners (on that occasion put up by the students) relating to the constitutional reform or with similar content on the facade of any other of its buildings.\n.With regard to the complaint filed with the National Human Rights Institution and Ombuds Office (INDDHH), the Government recalls that neither the ANEP nor any other public entity has any dependent link with the aforementioned institution and that it has no obligation to comply with any instruction issued by it, and so it stated that it did not accept its opinion. The ANEP brought invalidation proceedings in the Court for Administrative Disputes (TCA) and this case is currently being examined by the Supreme Court of Justice. What was prescribed by CODICEN (part of the ANEP) does not constitute any element of anti-union repression since it was addressed to its own offices and the order was issued for the purpose of upholding constitutional principles.\n.The Government refers to the complaint made by the principal of San Jos High School No.  in  for  allegedly excessive use of paid hours for the purpose of trade union activity and the use of an inappropriate legal basis to justify them'  which was backed by a parliamentarian from one of the political parties comprising the government coalition. In this regard, the Government indicates above all that at no time was action taken by the ANEP, through the DGES, that could constitute anti-union persecution. The Government points out that the existence of provisions regulating the use of trade union leave in the sphere of the ANEP cannot be ignored and that if faced with alleged irregularities the Administration has the power and the duty to review its own acts. The Government emphasizes that this cannot be regarded as anti-union action but action directly and solely related to compliance with legal standards.\n.With regard to the teacher Mr Slamovitz, the Government indicates that: (i) after analysing the findings of the investigation, the head of the DGES Legal Division suggested that administrative proceedings should be opened in relation to the teacher; the Government explains that the head of the DGES Legal Division is not bound by the statements of the investigator and may or may not concur with the preliminary report and, if appropriate, may issue a different opinion; (ii) accordingly, administrative proceedings were ordered in the present case, with the application of precautionary measures (suspension from duties and a  per cent pay deduction), within the scope of the regulations in force (Ordinance No.  of ); (iii)""]"
