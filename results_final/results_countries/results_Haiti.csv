0,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ) paras ' ].
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has been obliged once again to postpone its examination of this case. At its November  meeting [see th Report, para. ], the Committee expressed regret at the continued lack of cooperation and launched an urgent appeal to the Government, indicating that it would present a report on the substance of the matter at its next meeting even if the information or observations requested had not been received on time. To date, the Government has not sent the requested information.
.During its previous examination of the case, in March , the Committee made the following recommendations [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee again deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations, even though it has been asked to do so on several occasions, including through urgent appeals, and urges it to reply as soon as possible.(b)	In the light of the scant and contradictory information brought to its attention, the Committee urges the Government and the complainant organization to provide precise information concerning the establishment of the Haiti Postal Workers' Union (SPH) (date of establishment, registration procedure, statutes, etc.) and the circumstances surrounding its alleged dissolution.(c)	The Committee urges the Government to expedite an independent inquiry into the allegations concerning the automatic laying off of the union representatives concerned, namely Mr Daniel Dantes, Mr Fely Desire, Mr Jean Estima Fils, Mr Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Mr Ronald Joseph, Mr Harold Colson Lazarre, Mr Amos Musac and Mr Guito Phadael, and to provide information on their present situation. If it is found that acts of anti-union discrimination have been committed by the Directorate General of the Post Office, the Committee calls on the Government to take the necessary measures of redress, including ensuring that the workers concerned are reinstated without loss of pay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all measures taken in this regard and the results of those measures, and to indicate whether any court rulings have been issued in these cases.(d)	In the light of the issues raised in this complaint, the Committee reminds the Government once again that it may avail itself of the technical assistance of the Office.
.The Committee deplores that the Government has not yet provided the requested information, especially given the time that has elapsed since the complaint was filed in , and despite another urgent appeal.
.Hence, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government once again that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization (ILO) for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect for trade union rights in law and in practice. The Committee is confident that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, they must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations brought against them [see First Report of the Committee, , para. ]. In spite of the multiple difficulties the country has had to face, the Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.The Committee also notes that the complainants did not send the requested information concerning recommendation (b).
.Recalling that the allegations in this case concern the automatic laying off in  of union officials working in the postal sector, their non-reinstatement in their posts and the dissolution of their longstanding-union, the Committee is obliged to refer to the conclusions and recommendations it made during the examination of this case at its meeting in March  [see rd Report, paras  to .] Given the difficulty in obtaining the requested information, from both the Government and the complainant organization, the Committee invites the Government to accept an advisory mission to facilitate understanding and resolution of the outstanding issues.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations, even though it has been asked to do so on several occasions, including through urgent appeals and urges it once again to reply as soon as possible.(b)	In the light of the scant and contradictory information brought to its attention, the Committee once again urges the Government and the complainant organization to provide precise information concerning the establishment of the Haiti Postal Workers' Union (SPH) (date of establishment, registration procedure, statutes, etc.) and the circumstances surrounding its alleged dissolution.(c)	The Committee once again urges the Government to expedite an independent inquiry into the allegations concerning the automatic laying off of the union representatives concerned, namely Mr Daniel Dantes, Mr Fely Desire, Mr Jean Estima Fils, Mr Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Mr Ronald Joseph, Mr Harold Colson Lazarre, Mr Amos Musac and Mr Guito Phadael, and to provide information on their present situation.

.The Committee last examined this case, presented in , at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June ), paras ' ].
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has been obliged once again to postpone its examination of this case. In March , the Committee expressed regret at the continued lack of cooperation and launched an urgent appeal to the Government, indicating that it would present a report on the substance of the matter at its next meeting even if the information or observations requested had not been received on time. Even now, the Government has yet to provide its observations.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

.The Committee deplores that, over four years after the submission of the complaint, the Government has still not provided the requested observations and information in response to the allegations made by the complainant organization and the Committee s recommendations, even though it has been asked to do so on several occasions, including through urgent appeals.
.Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable procedural rule [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (), para. ], the Committee is obliged to present a new report",-1,2016,Haiti
1,"on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information that it hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the full procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of alleged violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee firmly maintains its position that, while this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments must recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations brought against them [see first report, , para. ]. In spite of the multiple difficulties the country has had to face, the Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations in this case concern the automatic laying off in  of union officials working in the postal sector, their non-reinstatement in their posts and the dissolution of their longstanding union. The union representatives concerned are Mr Daniel Dantes, Mr Fely Desire, Mr Jean Estima Fils, Mr Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Mr Ronald Joseph, Mr Harold Colson Lazarre, Mr Amos Musac and Mr Guito Phadael.
.The Committee deeply regrets that neither the Government nor the complainant organization has provided the requested information concerning the establishment of the Haiti Postal Workers' Union (SPH) (date of establishment, registration procedure, statutes, etc.) and the circumstances surrounding its alleged dissolution. The Committee also deeply regrets that it has not received any information from the Government on the automatic laying off of the above-mentioned union representatives. The Committee can only emphasize that such actions against union officials, which have been aggravated by the Government s silence over steps taken to ensure their protection such as conducting an independent inquiry as quickly as possible, are likely to corroborate the more general allegations of non-observance of union rights in the country.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee is obliged to refer the Government to the conclusions of its last examination of this case [see th Report, paras ' ] and to reiterate its previous recommendations in their entirety.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee again deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations, even though it has been asked to do so on several occasions, including through urgent appeals, and urges it to reply as soon as possible.(b) In the light of the scant and contradictory information brought to its attention, the Committee urges the Government and the complainant organization to provide precise information concerning the establishment of the Haiti Postal Workers' Union (SPH) (date of establishment, registration procedure, statutes, etc.) and the circumstances surrounding its alleged dissolution.(c) The Committee urges the Government to expedite an independent inquiry into the allegations concerning the automatic laying off of the union representatives concerned, namely Mr Daniel Dantes, Mr Fely Desire, Mr Jean Estima Fils, Mr Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Mr Ronald Joseph, Mr Harold Colson Lazarre, Mr Amos Musac and Mr Guito Phadael, and to provide information on their present situation.

.The Committee last examined the complaint from the Confederation of Public and Private Sector Workers (CTSP) at its June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (June ), paras ' ].
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has been obliged to postpone its examination of this case twice. At its March  meeting, the Committee expressed regret at the Government s persistent non-cooperation and launched an urgent appeal to the Government indicating that a report would be presented on the substance of the matter at its next meeting, even if the information or observations requested had not been received on time. In a communication dated  May , the Government explains that this delay is due to the various crises that the country has experienced since the complaint was lodged in  and merely recalls the applicable legislation on the protection of the right to organise.

.The Committee deplores that, despite the time which has elapsed since the submission of the complaint, the Government has not provided the requested observations and information in response to the allegations made by the complainant organization and the Committee s recommendations, even though it has been asked to do so on several occasions, including through urgent appeals. While noting the crisis situation referred to by the government in its communication of  May , the Committee firmly urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future.

.The Committee recalls that the allegations in this case concern the automatic laying off of union officials working in the postal sector in , their non-reinstatement in their posts and the dissolution of their well-established union. The union representatives concerned are Mr Daniel Dantes, Mr Fely Desire, Mr Jean Estima Fils, Mr Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Mr Ronald Joseph, Mr Harold Colson Lazarre, Mr Amos Musac and Mr Guito Phadael.
.The Committee deeply regrets that neither the Government nor the complainant organization has provided the requested information concerning the establishment of the Haiti Postal Workers' Union (SPH) (date of establishment, registration procedure, statutes and so on) and the circumstances surrounding its alleged dissolution. It also deeply regrets not receiving any information from the Government on the automatic laying off of the above mentioned union representatives, the latter having confined itself to recalling the legislation on the protection of the right to organise. Such actions against union officials, reinforced by the Government s silence over the steps taken to ensure their protection, such as by conducting an independent inquiry as quickly as possible, would appear to corroborate the more general allegations of non-observance of union rights in the country.
.Under these circumstances, the",-1,2016,Haiti
2,"Committee finds itself obliged to refer the Government to its conclusions from its last examination of this case [see th Report, paras ' ] and to recall all of its previous recommendations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations, even though it has been asked to do so on several occasions, including through urgent appeals, and urges it to reply as soon as possible.(b)	In the light of the scant and contradictory information brought to its attention, the Committee urges the Government and the complainant organization to provide precise information concerning the establishment of the Haiti Postal Workers' Union (SPH) (date of establishment, registration procedure, statutes and so on) and the circumstances surrounding its alleged dissolution.(c)	The Committee urges the Government to expedite an independent inquiry into the allegations concerning the automatic laying off of the union representatives concerned, namely Mr Daniel Dantes, Mr Fely Desire, Mr Jean Estima Fils, Mr Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Mr Ronald Joseph, Mr Harold Colson Lazarre, Mr Amos Musac and Mr Guito Phadael, and to provide information on their present situation. If it is found that acts of anti union discrimination have been committed by the Directorate-General of the Post Office, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary remedial measures, including to ensure the reinstatement of the workers concerned without loss of pay.

.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Confederation of Public and Private Sector Workers (CTSP) dated  August .
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has been obliged to postpone consideration of this case on several occasions. At its October November  meeting, the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government, drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting if the information or observations of the Government had not been sent in time [see rd Report, para. ]. At its March  meeting, the Committee expressed its regret with regard to the continuing lack of cooperation and indicated to the Government that it would present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the information or observations requested were not received on time. To date, the Government has not sent its observations.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August , the complainant organization alleges that on  October , eight union officials who are members of the Executive Committee of the Haiti Postal Workers Union (SPH), a union affiliated to the CTSP, were laid off after a meeting with the Directorate-General of the Post Office of Haiti on the grounds that the Post Office did not recognize the legitimacy of the union. The officials concerned are Messrs Daniel Dantes, Fely Desire, Jean Estima Fils, Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Ronald Joseph, Harold Colson Lazarre, Amos Musac and Guito Phadael. The Directorate General of the Post Office claims that these individuals have not submitted any official document  formalizing' the union in question. The complainant organization considers this decision to be illegal and that lay-offs should not exceed  days in accordance with the Decree of  May  amending the general civil service regulations, whereas the union officials concerned have still not been reinstated in their posts. According to the organization, this [response] constitutes retaliation against the officials concerned merely for belonging to a union; moreover, it has led to the dissolution of the union, which has been in existence for more than  years, and forms part of the general drive to dismantle unions, in violation of the ILO Conventions ratified by Haiti.
.The complainant organization indicates that the Office of the Ombudsperson, a constitutional State body responsible for the protection of citizens, has formally recommended that the Directorate-General of the Post Office should reinstate the union representatives, although no action has been taken to give effect to this recommendation. All avenues of redress in terms of mediation and negotiation have ended in failure.
.The Committee deeply regrets the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed since the submission of the complaint, the Government has not provided the observations and information requested in due time, although it has been invited to communicate these on several occasions, including through an urgent appeal (November ). Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable procedural rule, the Committee is required to submit a report on the substance of the case, without being able to take account of the observations that it was hoping to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the entire procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of alleged violations of freedom of association aims to ensure respect for this freedom, both in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments in their turn should recognize the importance of presenting, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them [see First Report, para. ]. The Committee calls on the Government to demonstrate greater cooperation in future.
.The Committee observes that the allegations in this case concern the automatic laying off of union officials working in the postal sector, their non-reinstatement in their posts and the dissolution of their union.
.The Committee observes, on the basis of the documents provided by the CTSP in support of the complaint (individual lay-off notices dated  October ), that the Directorate-General of the Post Office contends that the representatives of the SPH, affiliated to the CTSP, had not presented any official document  formalizing' the union at a meeting of the Executive Office on  September  and that, consequently, it did not recognize the legitimacy of the union. In contrast, the Committee notes that, according to the CTSP, the union in question has engaged in union activities for more than  years. In this regard, the Committee wishes to recall that, although the founders of a trade union should comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to impair the free establishment of organizations [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Lastly, the Committee takes note of the allegations of the CTSP that the union was dissolved after having existed for many years while the conditions of its dissolution have not been stated clearly. In the light of the scant and contradictory information brought to its attention, the Committee calls on the Government and the complainant organization to provide precise information concerning the establishment of the SPH (date of establishment, registration procedure, statutes '  as well as the conditions of its alleged dissolution.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the automatic laying off and non-reinstatement of the union officials concerned, the Committee notes that, according to the aforementioned individual notices, the Directorate-General criticizes the latter for  having sown discord at the Post Office of Haiti, encouraged employees to rebel against management and [  disrupted the proper functioning of the institution, to the point of mobilizing people to stop work on the basis of false allegations.'  In the absence of other indications from the Government, the Committee considers that sanctions such as these could seriously undermine the exercise of trade union rights. It draws the attention of the Government to the provisions of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ) in which it is expressly established that workers' representatives should enjoy effective protection against any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their status or activities as workers' representatives or on union membership, or participation in union activities in so far as they act in conformity with existing laws or collective agreements or other jointly agreed arrangements. The Committee also notes the communication of the Office of the Ombudsperson, addressed to the Directorate-General of the Post Office in December , which refers to promises to  regularize' the workers concerned and recommends that the Directorate-General should respect its commitments with regard to those concerned. Lastly, the Committee notes that according to article  of the Decree of  May  amending the general civil service regulations, staff may be automatically laid off as a disciplinary measure for a period not exceeding three months. Under",-1,2016,Haiti
3,"these circumstances, the Committee calls on the Government to expedite an independent inquiry into the allegations concerning the automatic laying off of the union representatives concerned, namely Messrs Daniel Dantes, Fely Desire, Jean Estima Fils, Petit-Maitre Jean-Jacques, Ronald Joseph, Harold Colson Lazarre, Amos Musac and Guito Phadael, and to provide information on their present situation. If it is found that acts of anti-union discrimination have been committed by the Directorate-General of the Post Office, the Committee calls on the Government to take the necessary measures of redress, including ensuring that the workers concerned are reinstated without loss of pay. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all measures taken in this regard and the results of such measures, and to indicate whether any court rulings have been issued in these cases.
.In light of the issues raised in this complaint, the Committee invites the Government to avail itself of the technical assistance of the Office.

.The Government has not transmitted any information in the meantime.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Upon last examining the case, the Committee made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores that, despite the time which has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Government has not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organizations.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that, in the future, searches carried out on trade union premises do not take place without the provision of an appropriate judicial warrant, and that they are restricted to the purposes which are the reason for the provision of the warrant.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that, in future, no trade unionists are arrested or detained without benefiting from normal judicial proceedings and having the right to due process, and in particular, the right to be informed of the charges brought against them, to communicate freely with counsel of their own choosing, and to a prompt trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority.(d) The Committee requests the Government to specify the measures it intends to take to identify and punish those responsible for the ill-treatment which, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, has been inflicted on several trade unionists during their detention by the police force.(e) The Committee requests the Government to indicate the measures it intends to take to ensure that leaders and members of workers' organizations are able to carry out their activities freely, without facing violence, pressure or threats of any kind.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee must again deplore the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint (January ) and since the last examination on the merits (March ), the Government has not responded to the allegations made by the complainant organization.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that, in the future, searches carried out on trade union premises do not take place without an appropriate judicial warrant, and that they are restricted to the purposes motivating the issuance of the warrant.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that, in future, no trade unionists are arrested or detained without benefiting from normal judicial proceedings and having the right to due process, and in particular, the right to be informed of the charges brought against them, to communicate freely with counsel of their own choosing and to a prompt trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority.(d) The Committee requests the Government to specify the measures it intends to take to identify and punish those responsible for the ill-treatment which, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, has been inflicted on several trade unionists during their detention by the police force.(e) The Committee requests the Government to indicate the measures it intends to take to ensure that leaders and members of workers' organizations are able to carry out their activities freely, without facing violence, pressure or threats of any kind.(f) Given the seriousness of the allegations and the complete absence of cooperation on the part of the Government, the Committee invites the Government to accept a direct contacts mission, in order to obtain as much information as possible regarding the case and to improve government cooperation regarding the Committee s procedures.(g) The Committee urges the Government to implement fully and promptly all the above recommendations and keep it informed of the progress made in this respect.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Haitian Trade Union Coordination (CSH), dated  January , and from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  January . The ICFTU provided additional information in a communication dated  March .
.Despite that, in paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of the case, even if the Government s observations or information had not been received in due time, it has yet to receive any observations from the Government.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communications of  and  January  respectively, the CSH and the ICFTU bring a complaint alleging that numerous violations of Conventions Nos.  and  have been committed in Haiti.Incident of  January 
.In their communications of  and  January  respectively, the CSH and the ICFTU allege that, around  p.m. on  January , a group of armed, uniformed police officers burst into the CSH premises, where a trade union meeting was in progress, without a search warrant. The police officers then proceeded to search the premises, claiming that they were looking for weapons and for the Secretary-General of the CSH, Mr. Charles Fritz. They also threatened to kill all those present, as well as the Secretary-General, who was absent. Failing to find what they wanted, the police then arrested ten men and one woman, including several trade union members, and took them to Port-au-Prince police station, where they were detained without seeing a judge or being charged with any offence. The ICFTU also alleges that the  detainees were seriously attacked during their detention at Port-au-Prince police station and that they were not allowed any outside contact, even with lawyers or fellow trade unionists.
.According to the ICFTU, the names of the  individuals arrested by the police are: David Dorme, Ludy Lapointe, Ernst Toncheau, Riginal Saint-Jean, Eloi Weche, Roselere Louis, Cdieu Dorvil, Jean Douleau Joseph, Stephen Guerrier, Andr Saurel and Norval Fleurant. The ICFTU states that only Mr. Norval Fleurant had been freed by  January .
.The ICFTU claims that, on  January , the ten remaining detainees were transferred to the national penitentiary, which normally holds common criminals after they are sentenced, still without having been taken before a judge or charged with any crime. Allegedly, the police had only made verbal accusations against the ten detainees of  plotting to destabilize national security'  The ten detainees appeared before a tribunal on  January .
.In its communication of  March , the ICFTU states that the ten remaining detainees, who had been held since  January , were freed on  February , after more than a month of arbitrary detention.Incident of  January 
.In its communication of  January , the ICFTU states that two trade unionists (Mr. Timothe Faduel, Secretary-General of the youth section of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH) and Mr. Jean-Luc Toussaint, a CATH member), were arrested by police officers from the General Security Unit of the Palais national and detained without charge after a peaceful demonstration in Port-au-Prince on  January , which had been carried off without incident. The ICFTU claims that these two trade unionists were severely beaten by the police during their detention. The two trade unionists had been released by  January .Threats against trade union members
.In its communication of  January , the CSH states that, besides the threats made by the police officers during the incident of  January  at the CSH headquarters, Mr. Charles Fritz, Secretary-General of the CSH, has suffered serious intimidation from violent groups close to the Government, which has forced him to remain in hiding since November . The CSH states, moreover, that although it has reported this intimidation many times, no steps have been taken to protect Mr. Fritz s person or to bring the guilty parties to justice.
.In its communication of  March , the ICFTU also states that, even before the incident of  January , threats had already been made against the  individuals arrested on that occasion and their families, as well as against other union leaders. The ICFTU claims that several Haitian trade unionists chose to go into hiding on  February  for fear of reprisals by the  Chimres' and other armed  criminal' elements.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time which has passed since the presentation of the complaint, to date the Government has not responded to the allegations made by the complainant organizations, although the Committee has urged it to",-1,2004,Haiti
5,"send its observations or information on the case on several occasions, including through an urgent appeal launched at the Committee s June  meeting. Under these circumstances, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report as approved by the Governing Body, the Committee stated that it would present a report on the substance of this case at its next session, even if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time.
.The Committee reminds the Government, firstly, that the aim of all the procedures established by the International Labour Organization in relation to the examination of allegations related to violations of freedom of association is to ensure that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations are respected, in fact and in law; the Committee thus believes that though this procedure protects governments from unfounded accusations, those same governments should in turn recognize the importance of providing detailed and precise responses concerning the substance of the alleged facts for objective examination [see First Report, para. ].
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations' allegations in this case concern various violations of the fundamental principles of freedom of association laid down in Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee considers that these violations can be grouped into four main types.
.First, the Committee notes the allegation of the complainant organizations that, at the incident of  January , the group of police officers who carried out the search of the CSH premises had no judicial warrant. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the entry by police or military forces into trade union premises without a judicial warrant constitutes a serious and unjustifiable interference in trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that, in the future, searches carried out on trade union premises do not take place without the provision of an appropriate judicial warrant, and that they are restricted to the purposes which are the reason for the provision of the warrant.
.Secondly, the Committee notes the complainant organizations' claim that, during both the incident of  January  and that of  January , the police arbitrarily arrested and detained several trade unionists, without bringing them before a judge or charging them with any offence. In regard to this, the Committee is compelled to recall that measures that deprive trade union leaders and members of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. While noting that all of the trade unionists involved in this complaint have now been freed, the Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that, in future, no trade unionists are arrested or detained without benefiting from normal judicial proceedings and having the right to due process, and in particular, the right to be informed of the charges brought against them, to communicate freely with counsel of their own choosing, and to a prompt trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority.
.Thirdly, the Committee notes the allegation of the ICFTU that, during their detention, the trade unionists involved in the incidents of  and  January  were victims of ill treatment including physical attack. The Committee is compelled to recall in this respect that, as regards allegations of the physical ill-treatment of trade unionists, governments should give the necessary instructions so as to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and apply effective sanctions where cases of such treatment are found. It has also emphasized the importance that should be attached to the principle laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights according to which all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect of the inherent dignity of the human person [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to specify the measures it intends to take to identify and punish those responsible for the ill-treatment which, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, has been inflicted on several trade unionists during their detention by the police force.
.Lastly, the Committee notes the complainant organizations' claim that many trade unionists are the victims of constant threats and intimidation from certain violent groups, and that this has led some of them to go into hiding for fear that these groups might carry out their threats. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders or members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate the measures it intends to take to ensure that leaders and members of workers' organizations are able to carry out their activities freely, without facing violence, pressure or threats of any kind.
.In light of its preceding interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores that, despite the time which has lapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Government has not replied to the allegations made by the complainant organizations.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that, in the future, searches carried out on trade union premises do not take place without the provision of an appropriate judicial warrant, and that they are restricted to the purposes which are the reason for the provision of the warrant.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that, in future, no trade unionists are arrested or detained without benefiting from normal judicial proceedings and having the right to due process, and in particular, the right to be informed of the charges brought against them, to communicate freely with counsel of their own choosing, and to a prompt trial by an impartial and independent judicial authority.(d) The Committee requests the Government to specify the measures it intends to take to identify and punish those responsible for the ill-treatment which, according to the allegations of the ICFTU, has been inflicted on several trade unionists during their detention by the police force.(e) The Committee requests the Government to indicate the measures it intends to take to ensure that leaders and members of workers' organizations are able to carry out their activities freely, without facing violence, pressure or threats of any kind.",-1,2004,Haiti
6,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  December  and  June  from the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH). This complaint was supported in a communication dated  February  from Education International (EI).
.The Committee has had to postpone examination of this case on two occasions because the Government has not sent its observations. At its November  meeting [see rd Report, para. ], the Committee sent an urgent appeal to the Government, drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it may present a report on the substance of these cases if the Government's observations or information have not been received in due time.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  December  and  June , the complainant organization states that on  February  the CNEH and other trade union organizations signed a draft agreement relating to the working conditions of teaching staff with the Government of Haiti. This draft agreement included, specifically, a wage adjustment of  per cent, and the establishment of a vocational training plan, an insurance plan for teachers and a commission for trade union matters. According to the complainant organization, the Government paid only  per cent of the wage adjustment and did not respect any of the other points of the agreement. Faced with a government refusal to enter into negotiations again, the CNEH threatened to carry out periodic strikes. Following a general strike in January , an agreement was signed on  February  by the Minister of National Education and the CNEH specifying full implementation of the draft agreement of February .
.The complainant organization explains that as none of the elements in the agreement of  February  were respected, it continued its efforts to convince the Government to honour its commitments with the aim of avoiding further strikes. Finally, the CNEH and the Ministry of National Education came to an agreement in May . However, once again, the complainant organization states that when school started again in September  the Government had still not fulfilled the terms of the agreement. Therefore, on  September  the CNEH gave notice of strike action in a letter to the Government for  October  onwards unless the Government fulfilled its commitments as laid down in the agreements. The strike began on the date specified.
.Following a meeting between the Minister of National Education and representatives of the CNEH on  October , the parties agreed to call upon the Ombudsman to mediate. However, on  October , the Prime Minister stated on the radio that disciplinary measures would be carried out against those teachers on strike. He made no mention of the mediation. Subsequently, on  October ,  teachers, including three regional and national trade union officials of CNEH, were suspended without pay for serious reasons. The CNEH adds that on  October a representative of the Ministry had invited the teachers, during a public meeting, to return to work unconditionally. Roussan Coffy, Herv Alix and Andranne Roy, the three members of CNEH who were disciplined, requested the representative to negotiate with the trade unions and not with the teachers. The complainant organization claims that a number of attempts were made by the Ministry of National Education to negotiate directly with the teachers in order to sideline the trade unions.
.The complainant organization explains that it made the lifting of the strike conditional to the lifting of sanctions and the resumption of negotiations conditions. Furthermore, it maintains that other types of reprisals were carried out by the Government, in particular hiring, under contract, non-teachers to fill the positions of the teaching staff on strike. Finally, the CNEH indicates that the Government encouraged the creation of a trade union for teachers on  November .
.In a recent communication of  June , the complainant organization states that, following the teachers' strike,  members of CNEH whose files were transferred to the Ministry of National Education were disciplined in a discriminatory manner as their salaries for October  were reduced without warning, in violation of the laws currently in force. The complainant organization also indicates that, following negotiations with the Ministry of National Education in January , Messrs. Coffy and Alix were reinstated in their respective posts. However, Ms. Roy has still not been reinstated and Mr. Alix has since been transferred without justification and in violation of the law.
.The Committee deplores the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint and bearing in mind the extreme gravity of the allegations, the Government has not provided in due time the comments and information requested by the Committee, although it was invited to send its reply on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal at its November  meeting. In these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rule of procedure [see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is obliged to submit a report on the substance of this case in the absence of the information it had hoped to receive in due time from the Government.
.The Committee once again reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization to examine allegations concerning violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect of trade union rights in law and in fact. If this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies concerning the substance of the allegations brought against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.Finally, the Committee expresses its deep concern that this is the third complaint that has been lodged against the Government of Haiti in the last  months, and that the Government has provided no information whatsoever to the Committee. It hopes that the new Government will demonstrate its good faith by cooperating in the future over complaints lodged against it before the Committee.
.The Committee notes that the current complaint concerns allegations of disciplinary measures carried out following strike action and acts of anti-union discrimination. Regarding the allegations of disciplinary measures taken against teachers following the strike that took place in October , the Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization,  teachers, three of whom were trade union officials of CNEH, were suspended without pay for serious reasons one month following the start of the strike. The Committee notes the CNEH declaration that, since January , only one of the trade union officials has been reinstated in his post while a second has been unjustly transferred and the third, Ms. Roy, has still not been reinstated. No information has been received regarding the outcome of the situation for the eight other teachers. In this regard, the Committee recalls that it has always recognized the right to strike by workers and their organizations as a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interests. Furthermore, no one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out a legitimate strike [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ]. In this particular case and according to the information available in the file, there is nothing to indicate that the strike organized by the teachers after long and fruitless negotiations with the Government was illegal, since Haitian legislation grants teachers the right to strike and prior notice of the strike had been lodged. The Committee emphasizes that respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that workers should not be dismissed or refused re-employment on account of their having participated in a strike or other industrial action. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to ensure the immediate reinstatement in their respective posts of all the teachers, including the trade union officials of CNEH, who were disciplined following their participation in the October  strike. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Regarding the allegations of anti-union discrimination against the  teachers who are members of CNEH and whose wages for October  were reduced following their participation in the strike, the Committee notes that the strike began on  October and the wage deductions for the days of the strike in October seemed to correspond to the duration of the strike. In these circumstances, this measure cannot be considered as disciplinary action in response to the strike.
.Regarding the allegations of hiring non-teachers to fill the positions of the teaching staff on strike, the Committee, in the absence of detailed information from the complainant organization and the Government's reply, can only state that the hiring of workers",-1,2000,Haiti
7,"to break a strike in a sector which cannot be regarded as an essential sector in the strict sense of the term constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. As the teaching sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term, the Committee requests the Government to refrain from hiring non-teachers to replace teachers on strike.
.Finally, regarding the allegations that the Government encouraged the creation of a trade union for teachers in November , the Committee recalls that only through the development of free and independent organizations can a government confront its economic and social problems and resolve them in the best interests of the workers and the nation. The Committee once again emphasizes the importance it attaches to the respect of the Resolution concerning the Independence of the Trade Union Movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). Recalling that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the formal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee urges the Government to refrain from interfering in the creation of a trade union, or from showing favouritism towards, or discrimination against, any given trade union.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee expresses its deep concern that this is the third complaint that has been lodged against the Government of Haiti in the last  months, with the Government providing no information whatsoever to the Committee.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps without delay so that all teachers, including the trade union officials of CNEH who were disciplined following their participation in the strike of October , are immediately reinstated in their respective posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) Recalling that the teaching sector is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term, the Committee requests the Government to refrain from hiring non-teachers to replace those teachers on strike.(d) Emphasizing the importance that it attaches to the respect of the Resolution concerning the Independence of the Trade Union Movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), the Committee urges the Government to refrain from interfering in the creation of trade unions or from showing favouritism towards, or discrimination against, any given trade union.",-1,2000,Haiti
8,".At its June  session, in the light of the Committee s interim conclusions, the Governing Body approved the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not replied to the allegations despite the fact that it was invited to do so on several occasions, including through an urgent appeal, and it counts on an immediate reply on the Government s part.(b) The Committee urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that, in future, workers and their organizations can exercise their rights in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind, in particular by instigating independent judicial inquiries with a view to establishing the facts, punishing those responsible and preventing recurrences.(c) The Committee requests the Government to begin independent judicial inquiries into the attempts to murder Mr. Laguerre and Mr. Lveill and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such inquiries.(d) The Committee insists that the Government take all necessary measures to prevent future recurrences of arrests or detentions of trade union leaders and members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of workers' interests.(e) The Committee requests the Government without delay to take all necessary measures to ensure that the Federation of Electricity Workers of Haiti (FESTRED ) regains the free use of its premises and can carry out its legitimate trade union activities in full freedom, in particular the right of assembly, and to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.(f) The Committee requests the Government to supply all relevant information on the dismissal of a large number of leaders and members of the complainant organization within the company Electricit d ati.
.The Committee deplores the fact that, despite the time that has passed since the presentation of the complaint, and given the gravity of the allegations that have been made, the Government has not replied to any of the allegations made by the complainant, although it has been invited on several occasions to present its own comments and observations on the case, notably through an urgent appeal. Under these circumstances, in accordance with the applicable rule of procedure [see the Committee s th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is bound to present a report on the substance of the case, even without the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government, firstly, that the purpose of the procedure instituted by the International Labour Organization for examining allegations relating to violations of freedom of association is to ensure respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies concerning the substance of the allegations brought against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.Lastly, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that, despite cases relating to Haiti being included in a special paragraph in the introduction to the Committee s most recent report under the heading  Serious and urgent cases which the Committee especially draws to the attention of the Governing Body' [see th Report, para. ], the Government of Haiti still appears unwilling to cooperate with the Committee in relation to the complaints lodged against it.
.The Committee recalls that the ICFTU s allegations concerned in particular various violations of the physical integrity of trade union leaders and members, including in some cases attempted murder. In the absence of any new information concerning this matter, the Committee is obliged to repeat its earlier conclusions. Thus it recalls that the rights of workers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of those organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary measures to ensure that this principle is respected in future, in particular by instigating independent judicial inquiries with a view to establishing the facts, punishing those responsible and preventing recurrences. In particular, it urges the Government to begin such inquiries into the attempts to murder Mr. Laguerre and Mr. Lveill and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such inquiries.
.With regard to the arrests and detentions in this case, the Committee once again deplores the detention of four national trade union leaders for two days without charge. It recalls that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their defence of workers' interests constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee insists that the Government take all the necessary measures to prevent any recurrences of this in future.
.The Committee once more emphasizes that the occupation or closure of trade union premises constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association and a serious interference in trade union activities [see Digest, op. cit., paras. -]. The Committee requests the Government to take all the necessary measures without delay to ensure that FESTRED  regains the free use of its premises and can carry out its legitimate trade union activities, in particular the right to hold meetings in full freedom. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to that end.
.The Committee reiterates the importance which it attaches to the principle that governments should consult trade union organizations to discuss the consequences of restructuring programmes on employment and working conditions [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee, recalling that it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes if they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], again urges the Government to supply all relevant information on the dismissals of a large number of leaders and members of the complainant organization.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not replied to the allegations, despite the fact that it was invited to do so on several occasions, including through an urgent appeal. Moreover, the Committee deeply deplores that, despite the fact that cases relating to Haiti were included in a special paragraph in the introduction to the Committee s latest report under the heading  Serious and urgent cases which the Committee especially draws to the attention of the Governing Body'  the Government of Haiti still appears unwilling to cooperate with the Committee with respect to the complaints lodged against it.(b) The Committee again urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that, in future, workers and their organizations can exercise their rights in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind, in particular by instigating independent judicial inquiries with a view to establishing the facts, punishing those responsible and preventing recurrences.(c) The Committee requests the Government once again to begin independent judicial inquiries into the attempts to murder Mr. Laguerre and Mr. Lveill and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such inquiries.(d) The Committee again insists that the Government take all necessary measures to prevent future occurrences of arrests or detentions of trade union leaders and members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of workers' interests.(e) The Committee again requests the Government without delay to take all necessary measures to ensure that the Federation of Electricity Workers of Haiti (FESTRED ) regains the free use of its premises and can carry out its legitimate trade union activities in full freedom, in particular the right of assembly, and to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.(f) The Committee requests the Government to promptly supply all relevant information on the dismissal of a large number of leaders and members of the complainant organization within the company Electricit d ati.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  September .
.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee was obliged on two occasions to postpone its examination of the case. At its March  meeting (see the Committee's th Report, para. ), the Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government drawing its attention to the fact that, under the rule of procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report approved by the Governing Body, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the information and observations of the Government had not been received in due time.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining",-1,1999,Haiti
9,"Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU alleges that the company Electricit d'Ha?ti (EDH) violated freedom of association and the free exercise of the right to organize of trade union leaders and members of the Federation of Electricity Workers of Haiti (FESTRED'H). In particular, it refers to the mass dismissal in November  of  leaders and more than  members of FESTRED'H, the closure of trade union offices by armed persons, the ban on any meetings by union members in the company, the attempted murder of two trade union officials, and arrests and assaults against other union leaders.
.The complainant points out that these events originate from a conflict between the company and the authorities, on the one hand, and FESTRED'H, on the other, that goes back ten years. From - onwards, the existing trade union had undertaken a ""clean-up"" campaign against waste, non-payment of invoices by well-to-do individuals close to the Government and by some companies, and various other practices generally referred to as ""non-technical losses"", and had also sought improvements in working conditions. Throughout those years, the union faced constant difficulties in its activities; several of its members suffered harassment or arbitrary imprisonment, others were murdered, particularly during the coup d'tat in September . Several members of the union were forced into exile to save their own lives. The return of President Aristide in  coincided with the launch of a neo-liberal economic policy of privatizing state-owned enterprises, and the EDH was at the top of the list of companies to be privatized. FESTRED'H opposed this policy from the beginning and put forward alternatives. The situation deteriorated, as the existence of an active mobilizing trade union became intolerable for the company and for the political authorities.
.It was in this context that the company decided to cancel all the agreements which it had concluded with the union, including agreements on wage increases and on the establishment of a bipartite committee responsible for reducing ""non-technical losses"". The management also launched a defamation campaign against a number of trade union leaders and made a number of accusations against the union, none of which were proven. An altercation in October  between two EDH employees led to the dismissal in November  of  trade union leaders and more than  union members, on the pretext of administrative requirements and allegations of sabotage; however, no formal accusations were made against anyone. Faced with the impossibility of establishing any dialogue with the management, FESTRED'H went through all the avenues of appeal available at national level (Labour Directorate; Ministry of Social Affairs; Tripartite Consultation and Arbitration Committee; Ministry of Public Works; Ministry of Transport and Communications), but to no avail. On  October , armed individuals closed the union's offices and all gatherings of union members were prohibited within the enterprise. In December , a representative of the Fdration des travailleurs du Qubec, who had been asked by the ICFTU to act as an ""honest broker"", held a number of meetings with various representatives of the authorities in order to resolve the dispute, still to no avail, although a representative of the authorities acknowledged that the situation had to be remedied and said that appropriate measures would be taken. Since then, all the union's attempts to re-launch this dialogue have been stone-walled.
.In addition, several trade members and leaders suffered violations of their physical integrity. On  October, in the course of attempted negotiations, armed individuals fired shots at the union's President Mr. Vilbrun Laguerre, who was subsequently forcibly retired, in contravention of the company's own administrative procedures and regulations. On  November, two armed individuals attempted to kill the union delegate Mr. Ronald Lveill. Lastly, four members of the union's national executive (Mr. Paulin Elladin, Mr. Buffon Sambourg, Mr. Flix P. Michel and Mr. Jean-Ren Martineau) were arbitrarily imprisoned and brutally assaulted before being released two days later without charge.
.The complainant maintains that workers and their organizations should be able to express their dissatisfaction regarding economic and social issues which affect the interests of their members. The systematic refusal to engage in dialogue and the brutal repression of workers constitute a violation of the most basic principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee deplores the fact that, despite the time that has passed since the presentation of the complaint, and given the gravity of the allegations that have been made, the Government has not replied to any of the allegations made by the complainant, although it has been invited on several occasions to present its own comments and observations on the case, notably through an urgent appeal. Under these circumstances, in accordance with the applicable rule of procedure (see the Committee's th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session), the Committee is bound to present a report on the substance of the case, even without the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government, first, that the primary goal of the procedure instituted by the International Labour Organization for examining allegations relating to violations of freedom of association is to ensure that trade union freedoms are respected in law and in fact (see the Committee's First Report, para. ).
.The Committee notes that the allegations concern in particular various violations of the physical integrity of trade union leaders and members, including in some cases attempted murder. The Committee recalls that the rights of workers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of those organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee urges the Government to take all the necessary measures to ensure that this principle is respected in future, in particular by instigating independent judicial inquiries with a view to establishing the facts, punishing those responsible and preventing recurrences. In particular, it urges the Government to begin such inquiries into the attempts to murder Mr. Laguerre and Mr. Lveill and to keep it informed of the outcome of any such inquiries.
.With regard to the arrests and detentions in this case, the Committee deplores the detention of four national trade union leaders for two days without charge. It recalls that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their defence of workers' interests constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee insists that the Government take all the necessary measures to prevent any recurrences of this in future.
.The Committee also emphasizes that the occupation or closure of trade union premises constitutes a serious violation of freedom of association and a serious interference in trade union activities (see Digest, op. cit., paras. -). The Committee requests the Government to take all the necessary measures without delay to ensure that FESTRED'H regains the free use of its premises and can carry out its legitimate trade union activities, in particular the right to hold meetings in full freedom. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to that end.

.In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee had to postpone its examination of the case twice. At its June  meeting [see st Report, para. ], the Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting if the information and observations of the Government had not been received in due time.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the complainant explains that on  May  it informed the management of YAS Sewing Enterprise in writing of the establishment of a workers' organization within the enterprise, called the ""Workers' Union of YAS Sewing Enterprise"", emphasizing that this organization has been recognized by and registered with the Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and complies with Law No. VI on trade unions of the Labour Code in force. In its communication to the enterprise management, the newly created trade union requested a meeting with the management to discuss employees' working conditions, in order to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on these issues. This letter was signed by Messrs. Paul Brissaut and Andr Clervin, in their capacity as members of the executive committee of the new union.
.Following this letter, the complainant states that Messrs. Brissaut and Clervin were dismissed by YAS Sewing Enterprise on  May . In the dismissal letters, attached to the file by the complainant, the enterprise management refers to ""conduct aimed at disrupting the smooth running of the enterprise"" to justify the two dismissals. In addition, the complainant alleges that, since the establishment of the union, the enterprise management has been systematically harassing and threatening all workers suspected of being members of the union. Any worker caught distributing union leaflets is threatened with dismissal, as well as with physical reprisals against family members.
.The Committee deplores the fact that, despite the time that has elapsed since the submission of the complaint, and given the serious nature of the allegations that have been made, the Government has not replied to any of the allegations made by the complainant, although it has been invited on several occasions to present its own comments and observations on the case, including by means of an urgent appeal. Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable rule of procedure [see the Committee's th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is bound to present a report on the substance of the case, even without the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government, first, that the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognize the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination and detailed replies to the allegations brought against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.Finally, the Committee expresses its deep concern at the fact that this is the third complaint made against the Government of Haiti in the last  months without the latter having conveyed information of any sort to the Committee.
.The Committee notes that the present complaint concerns allegations of dismissals of trade unionists following the establishment of an enterprise trade union and acts of intimidation against workers suspected of being members of the union.
.The Committee observes that the complainant states that it informed the management of YAS Sewing Enterprise of the establishment of a trade union within the enterprise on  May . The Committee also notes that, according to the complainant, the trade union in question has been recognized by and registered with the Labour Directorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and complies with the legislation in force on trade unions. The two signatories of the letter informing the enterprise management of the establishment of the union were dismissed the day following dispatch of the letter, i.e. on  May , on grounds of conduct, according to the employer, aimed at disrupting the smooth running of the enterprise. In addition, since this date, the complainant affirms that numerous workers suspected of belonging to the union have been the victims of acts of intimidation and harassment.
.In these circumstances and in the absence of any reply from the Government, the Committee first of all recalls that the dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organization or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee cannot but point out here that the persons concerned were dismissed immediately after the establishment of the union had been announced to the employer. In the Committee's opinion, there is consequently a strong presumption that the dismissals in question took place on account of activities connected with the setting up of a trade union. Under these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an independent inquiry is immediately carried out on this matter. Should the outcome of this inquiry confirm the anti-union nature of the dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures for the two leaders to be reinstated in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. As regards the other acts of intimidation to which several workers of the company are said to have been subjected, the Committee asks the Government to investigate the matter and reminds it that it is responsible for preventing any acts of anti-union discrimination, and that the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not replied to the allegations despite the fact that it was invited to do so on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, and urges it to reply promptly.(b) As regards the dismissals of the two union leaders by YAS Sewing Enterprise, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that an independent inquiry is immediately carried out on this matter. Should the outcome of this inquiry confirm the anti-union nature of the dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures for the two leaders to be reinstated in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) As regards to the acts of intimidation to which several workers of YAS Sewing Enterprise are said to have been subjected after they joined the new union, the Committee asks the Government to investigate the matter and reminds it that it is responsible for preventing any acts of anti-union discrimination and requests it to ensure that the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation be accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.",-1,1999,Haiti
12,".In Case No. , the initial complaint of the ICFTU of  November  concerned violations of human rights and trade union rights resulting from the military coup d'tat of September  which overthrew the democratically elected Government of Haiti. According to the ICFTU, hundreds of people, including many trade unionists, were murdered or disappeared following the coup d'tat. Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed. The few trade union offices which stayed open were only able to do so because they remained extremely discreet. All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.
.The list of specific cases provided by the ICFTU is, according to this organization, in no way exhaustive in light of the fact that obtaining information and testimony in Haiti was extremely difficult because of the risk of jeopardizing the safety of the people concerned. These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On  October , Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation's premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on  September  and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November , army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin's remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr Franois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation's headquarters have been closed.- On  November  soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On  January , Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on  January  as a consequence of this torture.- On  March , Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On  March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On  May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On  May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women's branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of  May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July  in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists' union, AJH. The union was dismantled through acts of harassment and intimidation committed against its leaders, and the new pro-military leaders condemned the legitimate leaders in speeches made on the radio.- The Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH) was particularly singled out by the army. Its members were harassed, threatened and dismissed. One of its members was murdered. Jean Delince Josma, a member of the FESTREDH, was reportedly murdered by the army in October. Shortly after the coup d'tat of September, the army broke into buildings of the National Electric Company, threatening and harassing members of the FESTREDH. The director of the company, who had just been named, refused to follow the army's orders to dismiss the trade union leaders, and was dismissed himself. Subsequently,  members of the FESTREDH were dismissed in mid-December . On  December , two trade union leaders of the FESTREDH, Abel Pointdujour and Evans Saintune, were arrested when they tried to negotiate compensation for the company's workers who had been dismissed after the coup d'tat. They were only released three days later, after having been interrogated about their supposed political links and been advised that they should, in the interest of their own safety, leave the country. During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum. The General Secretary went into hiding after having discovered that his name was on a list of trade union leaders and leaders of grass-roots organizations sought by the army. A jeep belonging to the trade union and used by trade union leaders to maintain contact with their members in the countryside was destroyed by the army.- In January, two other leaders of the FESTREDH were arrested and harassed by the army. Delamain Ambroise and Raynald Garnier were abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention. They were subsequently released and dismissed from their jobs. On  April , several members of the executive and two trade union representatives, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were severely beaten by the army. From the month of September on, all the members of the executive and the FESTREDH were dismissed because of their trade union activities.- Farmers' trade unions have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment from the military. On  May , Jacques Joseph, the President of the CLAM, a farmers' trade union affiliated with the OGITH, and his wife were arrested and severely beaten. They were accused of leading a demonstration calling for the return of President Aristide. They were later released.- At the beginning of May, Daniel Pierre, the President of the UDTL, a trade union of farmers in Boukan Michel which is affiliated with the OGITH, was detained by the section chief, Yvon Verdieu. Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On  May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to",-1,1993,Haiti
13,"hold trade union meetings. The trade union leaders did not meet any more, as they feared for their safety.- The harassment of trade unions spread to a number of enterprises under the protection of the army in the private sector. On  and  May,  trade union leaders were dismissed from ""Home of Champions"", a US enterprise which produces baseballs and which is located in Cit Soleil. One month later, four other trade union leaders were also dismissed by the enterprise. When the director of the enterprise called the trade union leaders into his office to inform them of their dismissal, he stated that ""this is not the right time to be a trade unionist"".- The trade union leaders employed by three other US enterprises were also dismissed. They too reported anti-trade union statements made by management. Nine trade unionists were dismissed from the ""Michico"" enterprise which produces textile products, and eight from the ""Chancerelles Manufacturing"" enterprise which produces women's lingerie.- The management of the US ""Automatic Accusonic"" enterprise had a different but just as effective approach to destroying the enterprise's trade union. The factory was temporarily closed, and when it reopened it was declared a ""union-free"" company. None of the trade union leaders or trade unionists were re-employed. When the President of the trade union asked for them to be reinstated, he was severely beaten and his arm was broken.
.The ICFTU later sent supplementary information, which was obtained during a mission to Haiti from  to  January , reporting that the trade unionist Cajuste Lexinste, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Workers, Phabonord Saint Vil, the secretary of the organization, and Sauveur Orlus, the CGT's General Secretary in Gros Morne, were arrested on  April  and transferred to the main anti-gang squad, where they were tortured because they wanted to distribute a press release to protest against the arrest of several members of the CGT in Gros Morne.
.Furthermore, according to the ICFTU, on  February  more than  workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) were dismissed for having taken union training courses organized by the Trade Union of Workers, Employees and Temporary Workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (SOETRATEC). On  November  the members of the executive of this trade union had already been dismissed. Finally, on  March , Joseph Michelet, a member of the trade union of workers of Larco Frres SA, a union affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested, subjected to intensive interrogation on the Haitian crisis, and then released.
.The complaint of the WCL in Case No. , dated  March , addresses the fact that the Confederation of Haitian Workers (CTH), an organization affiliated with the WCL, has been the subject for many months of all sorts of administrative harassment. Its occupational organizations, and particularly the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA), the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, the National Federation of Industrial Workers and Subcontractors (FENATIS), and the Association of Newspaper Workers (ATPGA), are regularly hindered from exercising their trade union activities. Many of their members have been arrested or tortured, or have disappeared. Namely, there have been the following cases:- On  October , Pierre Andr Mertyl was tortured. There has still been no response to the complaint filed by the lawyers of the CTH (Confederation of Haitian Workers).- On  December , Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm in Jrmie, was tortured for no reason by Joseph Jean-Franois, a corporal in the army, and by Kesnel Guerrier.- On  January , Baselet Derival, a member of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, was arrested, imprisoned and tortured. He was held at the Faustin Soulouque barracks in Petit-Goave.- Pierre Trechelet, the brother of a member of the Executive Committee of the CTH, has been reported missing.- On  January , Raynold Belizaire, a member of the FENATIS, was shot twice while he was in his private home.- On  January , Estimable Jean-Emile, a correspondent of Radio Cacique and a member of the Democratic Youth Movement (affiliated with the Young Farmers' Association of Plagie-AJPL, which is an association under the FENATAPA) was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Mr. Gls, the head of the third section of Marchand Dessalines.
.The WCL goes on to explain that the possibility of holding trade union meetings without prior authorization, which is a fundamental right of workers and their organizations, was being flouted in Haiti. Indeed, on  January , the head of the fifth communal section of St. Marc (Tibordet - Antibonite region), prohibited a FENATAPA meeting which was to be chaired by Arsne Lebrun, the General Secretary of the Organization. The request for authorization was rejected by the authorities.
.Furthermore, according to the WCL, freedom of opinion and the right to information and to training, which are rights recognized as part of the free exercise of trade union rights, are also violated in Haiti. On  January , Jean Elder Almeus, a member of the ATPGA (Newspaper Workers' Association of Grand'Anse), was arrested while he participated in the ""Truth on the Drum"" programme broadcast by Radio Vision.
.Finally, on  December , during the arrest of three active members of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA) (they have since been released), audiovisual material including inter alia equipment and documents used for training of the rural population was confiscated by second-lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Ravix.
.The complaint of the commission of the General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) sent in communications dated  April  and  May  (Case No. ), confirms the illegal dismissal, under the pretext of lack of funds, of  workers personally identified by the director of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) on  February  as sympathizers of the SOETRATEC. This national trade union organization also reiterates the information according to which these dismissals followed the dismissal of  members of the SOETRATEC singled out by name, including the members of the trade unions' executive, as early as  November , under the pretext that the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CANEP) did not have any more money to pay them. The complainant organization explains that under President Aristide, the SOETRATEC held regular trade union meetings to deal with workers' problems and union affairs, and the members of this union had taken trade union training courses. The complainant organization points out that on  March  the SOETRATEC sent a letter to the director of the labour service of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but that nothing was done in response to this letter.
.CLAT, for its part, denounces the grenade attack in Jrmie on  June  of which Serge Paul, an important leader of the Confederation of Haitian Workers (CTH), was reportedly a victim. This attack reportedly led to the death of his two children and seriously injured a third child. CLAT adds that this union leader and six of his collaborators were reportedly arrested while organizing a seminar in Jrmie. Furthermore, the Deputy Secretary-General of the CTH, Louis Octave Dorvilier, was reportedly held by four armed individuals; he was abducted into a van blindfolded, kicked, tortured and then abandoned. The General-Secretary himself, Jean-Claude Lebrun, was reportedly threatened. Finally, three members of an organization in Marceline (Cap Perin South), Gerthin Augustin, Gabriel Louine and Romain Castra were abducted into a van, license number , on a road in Ption Villi; their whereabouts are as yet unknown.
.The Committee observes that these cases concern extremely serious allegations of violations of freedom of association by the military authorities who were exercising actual control in Haiti. Even in the absence of a reply on the substance of the case from the present democratic Government, which cannot be held responsible for these acts, the Committee has to determine which principles of freedom of association are at stake in these affairs so as to make it possible for the Government which has been restored to its prerogatives and functions in Haiti to redress these violations. Considering the scope of the issues involved, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal.
.The Committee notes that the violations of freedom of association in these cases related to the total absence of public democratic freedoms, characterized by measures of intimidation and anti-union harassment which had prompted trade unionists to go into exile and had involved murders, arrests, torture, abductions, dismissals, transfers of trade unionists, arson attacks against their places of work or residence, brutal repression of demonstrations or trade union meetings, the establishment of new trade unions by the military authorities and serious violations of trade unionists' rights to freedom of opinion, information and training.
.The Committee recalls that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists and with respect for basic human rights (see Digest of decisions and principles of the",-1,1993,Haiti
14,"Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , paras.  and ). The Committee expresses the fervent hope that the Government will ensure respect of these principles.
.The Committee notes with deep concern the allegations according to which the trade unionist of the Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH), Jean Delince Josma, was reportedly murdered by members of the army in October , the trade unionist of the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers, Jean-Claude Museau, was reportedly abducted by members of the army and tortured to death on  January , the trade unionist, Camille Chalmers, of the Trade Union of Electricity Workers, was beaten, arrested and interrogated for three hours, the trade unionists of the same union, Ambroise Delamain, Raynald Garnier, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were reportedly abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention, the trade unionist of the agricultural union affiliated with the OGITH, Jacques Joseph, and his wife, as well as Thermilien Pierre, were reportedly arrested and severely beaten, the trade unionists of the General Confederation of Workers, Cajuste Lexinste, Phabonord Saint Vil and Sauveur Orelus, were reportedly arrested on  April  and tortured at the anti-gang squad, and the trade unionists, Pierre Andr Mertyl, of the Confederation of Haitian Workers, Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm, Baselet Derival, of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers and Estimable Jean Emile of the Young Farmers' Association, were reportedly arrested and tortured respectively on  October ,  December ,  January  and  January . The trade unionist Serge Paul was reportedly the victim of a grenade attack on  June , the union leader Louis Octave Dorvilier was reportedly held, tortured and then abandoned and the trade union activists Gerthin Augustin, Gabriel Louine and Romain Castra have reportedly been abducted, their whereabouts as yet unknown.
.The Committee has indicated on numerous occasions that situations involving murder and other acts of violence, where trade unionists are involved, are sufficiently serious to warrant severe measures being taken by the authorities to restore a normal situation and that allegations by trade unionists of ill-treatment during their detention should be the subject of independent judicial inquiries to establish fully the facts, determine who is responsible, punish the guilty parties and prevent a repetition of such acts. Indeed, instructions should be given so that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and effective sanctions should be applied where cases of ill-treatment are found. (See Digest, op. cit., paras.  and .) The Committee thus expresses the firm hope that the Government will take measures to punish effectively those responsible for these murders and this ill-treatment, and requests that it keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiries and measures taken in this respect.
.As regards the climate of intimidation which has led a large number of activists and trade union leaders to go into exile, the Committee recalls that the forced exile of trade unionists is a serious violation of freedom of association. It urges the Government to enable these unionists to return to the country and to carry out their trade union activities in full freedom.
.As regards the establishment by the military authorities of organizations to replace the existing legitimate trade unions, the Committee condemns such acts, which seriously violate the right of workers to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, and it recalls that the public authorities must abstain from any intervention which would limit the rights granted by Convention No. , which Haiti has ratified, or which would hinder the legal exercise of those rights.
.The Committee further recalls that the right to organize trade union meetings and to take trade union training courses is an essential element of freedom of association.
.Finally, the Committee notes the important number of dismissals of activists for trade union activities which took place in many enterprises: the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) (because these workers were members or sympathizers of the Trade Union of Workers, Employees and Temporary Workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (SOETRATEC), were exercising legitimate trade union activities, were taking trade union training courses, or were members of the executive board of this union); the National Electric Company; the Teleco Telephone Company; the ""Home of Champions"" Company; the Michico Company; the ""Chanarelles"" Manufacturing Company. In this respect, the Committee must insist on the need to ensure respect of the principle according to which workers must benefit from adequate protection against acts of discrimination which may violate freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to enable all the workers dismissed for legitimate trade union activities to be reinstated in their jobs.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, in condemning the serious violations of freedom of association by the military authorities which were exercising control in Haiti, including murders, arrests, torture, abductions and the dismissal of trade unionists, as well as the establishment of organizations by the military authorities to replace the existing legitimate trade unions, and violations of trade unionists' freedom to hold meetings, to demonstrate and to carry out information and training activities, trusts that the present Government of Haiti, will ensure respect for the principles of freedom of association which have been violated, and that it will take the measures necessary to remedy the consequences of the acts which are the subjects of the complaints.(b) Considering the scope of the issues involved, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any inquiries concerning the violent deaths, arrests and torture of trade unionists, and in particular the measures taken to apply effective sanctions in the event these allegations are proven.(d) The Committee further requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it will take to enable the reinstatement in their posts of all the workers dismissed for their legitimate trade union activities and to ensure for workers the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing without interference from the public authorities.",-1,1993,Haiti

Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On  May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to",-1,1993,Haiti
16,"hold trade union meetings. The trade union leaders did not meet any more, as they feared for their safety.- The harassment of trade unions spread to a number of enterprises under the protection of the army in the private sector. On  and  May,  trade union leaders were dismissed from ""Home of Champions"", a US enterprise which produces baseballs and which is located in Cit Soleil. One month later, four other trade union leaders were also dismissed by the enterprise. When the director of the enterprise called the trade union leaders into his office to inform them of their dismissal, he stated that ""this is not the right time to be a trade unionist"".- The trade union leaders employed by three other US enterprises were also dismissed. They too reported anti-trade union statements made by management. Nine trade unionists were dismissed from the ""Michico"" enterprise which produces textile products, and eight from the ""Chancerelles Manufacturing"" enterprise which produces women's lingerie.- The management of the US ""Automatic Accusonic"" enterprise had a different but just as effective approach to destroying the enterprise's trade union. The factory was temporarily closed, and when it reopened it was declared a ""union-free"" company. None of the trade union leaders or trade unionists were re-employed. When the President of the trade union asked for them to be reinstated, he was severely beaten and his arm was broken.
.The ICFTU later sent supplementary information, which was obtained during a mission to Haiti from  to  January , reporting that the trade unionist Cajuste Lexinste, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Workers, Phabonord Saint Vil, the secretary of the organization, and Sauveur Orlus, the CGT's General Secretary in Gros Morne, were arrested on  April  and transferred to the main anti-gang squad, where they were tortured because they wanted to distribute a press release to protest against the arrest of several members of the CGT in Gros Morne.
.Furthermore, according to the ICFTU, on  February  more than  workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) were dismissed for having taken union training courses organized by the Trade Union of Workers, Employees and Temporary Workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (SOETRATEC). On  November  the members of the executive of this trade union had already been dismissed. Finally, on  March , Joseph Michelet, a member of the trade union of workers of Larco Frres SA, a union affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested, subjected to intensive interrogation on the Haitian crisis, and then released.
.The complaint of the WCL in Case No. , dated  March , addresses the fact that the Confederation of Haitian Workers (CTH), an organization affiliated with the WCL, has been the subject for many months of all sorts of administrative harassment. Its occupational organizations, and particularly the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA), the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, the National Federation of Industrial Workers and Subcontractors (FENATIS), and the Association of Newspaper Workers (ATPGA), are regularly hindered from exercising their trade union activities. Many of their members have been arrested or tortured, or have disappeared. Namely, there have been the following cases:- On  October , Pierre Andr Mertyl was tortured. There has still been no response to the complaint filed by the lawyers of the CTH (Confederation of Haitian Workers).- On  December , Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm in Jrmie, was tortured for no reason by Joseph Jean-Franois, a corporal in the army, and by Kesnel Guerrier.- On  January , Baselet Derival, a member of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, was arrested, imprisoned and tortured. He was held at the Faustin Soulouque barracks in Petit-Goave.- Pierre Trechelet, the brother of a member of the Executive Committee of the CTH, has been reported missing.- On  January , Raynold Belizaire, a member of the FENATIS, was shot twice while he was in his private home.- On  January , Estimable Jean-Emile, a correspondent of Radio Cacique and a member of the Democratic Youth Movement (affiliated with the Young Farmers' Association of Plagie-AJPL, which is an association under the FENATAPA) was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Mr. Gls, the head of the third section of Marchand Dessalines.
.The WCL goes on to explain that the possibility of holding trade union meetings without prior authorization, which is a fundamental right of workers and their organizations, was being flouted in Haiti. Indeed, on  January , the head of the fifth communal section of St. Marc (Tibordet - Antibonite region), prohibited a FENATAPA meeting which was to be chaired by Arsne Lebrun, the General Secretary of the Organization. The request for authorization was rejected by the authorities.
.Furthermore, according to the WCL, freedom of opinion and the right to information and to training, which are rights recognized as part of the free exercise of trade union rights, are also violated in Haiti. On  January , Jean Elder Almeus, a member of the ATPGA (Newspaper Workers' Association of Grand'Anse), was arrested while he participated in the ""Truth on the Drum"" programme broadcast by Radio Vision.
.Finally, on  December , during the arrest of three active members of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA) (they have since been released), audiovisual material including inter alia equipment and documents used for training of the rural population was confiscated by second-lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Ravix.
.The complaint of the commission of the General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) sent in communications dated  April  and  May  (Case No. ), confirms the illegal dismissal, under the pretext of lack of funds, of  workers personally identified by the director of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) on  February  as sympathizers of the SOETRATEC. This national trade union organization also reiterates the information according to which these dismissals followed the dismissal of  members of the SOETRATEC singled out by name, including the members of the trade unions' executive, as early as  November , under the pretext that the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CANEP) did not have any more money to pay them. The complainant organization explains that under President Aristide, the SOETRATEC held regular trade union meetings to deal with workers' problems and union affairs, and the members of this union had taken trade union training courses. The complainant organization points out that on  March  the SOETRATEC sent a letter to the director of the labour service of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but that nothing was done in response to this letter.
.CLAT, for its part, denounces the grenade attack in Jrmie on  June  of which Serge Paul, an important leader of the Confederation of Haitian Workers (CTH), was reportedly a victim. This attack reportedly led to the death of his two children and seriously injured a third child. CLAT adds that this union leader and six of his collaborators were reportedly arrested while organizing a seminar in Jrmie. Furthermore, the Deputy Secretary-General of the CTH, Louis Octave Dorvilier, was reportedly held by four armed individuals; he was abducted into a van blindfolded, kicked, tortured and then abandoned. The General-Secretary himself, Jean-Claude Lebrun, was reportedly threatened. Finally, three members of an organization in Marceline (Cap Perin South), Gerthin Augustin, Gabriel Louine and Romain Castra were abducted into a van, license number , on a road in Ption Villi; their whereabouts are as yet unknown.
.The Committee observes that these cases concern extremely serious allegations of violations of freedom of association by the military authorities who were exercising actual control in Haiti. Even in the absence of a reply on the substance of the case from the present democratic Government, which cannot be held responsible for these acts, the Committee has to determine which principles of freedom of association are at stake in these affairs so as to make it possible for the Government which has been restored to its prerogatives and functions in Haiti to redress these violations. Considering the scope of the issues involved, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal.
.The Committee notes that the violations of freedom of association in these cases related to the total absence of public democratic freedoms, characterized by measures of intimidation and anti-union harassment which had prompted trade unionists to go into exile and had involved murders, arrests, torture, abductions, dismissals, transfers of trade unionists, arson attacks against their places of work or residence, brutal repression of demonstrations or trade union meetings, the establishment of new trade unions by the military authorities and serious violations of trade unionists' rights to freedom of opinion, information and training.
.The Committee recalls that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists and with respect for basic human rights (see Digest of decisions and principles of the",-1,1993,Haiti
17,"Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , paras.  and ). The Committee expresses the fervent hope that the Government will ensure respect of these principles.
.The Committee notes with deep concern the allegations according to which the trade unionist of the Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH), Jean Delince Josma, was reportedly murdered by members of the army in October , the trade unionist of the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers, Jean-Claude Museau, was reportedly abducted by members of the army and tortured to death on  January , the trade unionist, Camille Chalmers, of the Trade Union of Electricity Workers, was beaten, arrested and interrogated for three hours, the trade unionists of the same union, Ambroise Delamain, Raynald Garnier, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were reportedly abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention, the trade unionist of the agricultural union affiliated with the OGITH, Jacques Joseph, and his wife, as well as Thermilien Pierre, were reportedly arrested and severely beaten, the trade unionists of the General Confederation of Workers, Cajuste Lexinste, Phabonord Saint Vil and Sauveur Orelus, were reportedly arrested on  April  and tortured at the anti-gang squad, and the trade unionists, Pierre Andr Mertyl, of the Confederation of Haitian Workers, Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm, Baselet Derival, of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers and Estimable Jean Emile of the Young Farmers' Association, were reportedly arrested and tortured respectively on  October ,  December ,  January  and  January . The trade unionist Serge Paul was reportedly the victim of a grenade attack on  June , the union leader Louis Octave Dorvilier was reportedly held, tortured and then abandoned and the trade union activists Gerthin Augustin, Gabriel Louine and Romain Castra have reportedly been abducted, their whereabouts as yet unknown.
.The Committee has indicated on numerous occasions that situations involving murder and other acts of violence, where trade unionists are involved, are sufficiently serious to warrant severe measures being taken by the authorities to restore a normal situation and that allegations by trade unionists of ill-treatment during their detention should be the subject of independent judicial inquiries to establish fully the facts, determine who is responsible, punish the guilty parties and prevent a repetition of such acts. Indeed, instructions should be given so that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and effective sanctions should be applied where cases of ill-treatment are found. (See Digest, op. cit., paras.  and .) The Committee thus expresses the firm hope that the Government will take measures to punish effectively those responsible for these murders and this ill-treatment, and requests that it keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiries and measures taken in this respect.
.As regards the climate of intimidation which has led a large number of activists and trade union leaders to go into exile, the Committee recalls that the forced exile of trade unionists is a serious violation of freedom of association. It urges the Government to enable these unionists to return to the country and to carry out their trade union activities in full freedom.
.As regards the establishment by the military authorities of organizations to replace the existing legitimate trade unions, the Committee condemns such acts, which seriously violate the right of workers to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, and it recalls that the public authorities must abstain from any intervention which would limit the rights granted by Convention No. , which Haiti has ratified, or which would hinder the legal exercise of those rights.
.The Committee further recalls that the right to organize trade union meetings and to take trade union training courses is an essential element of freedom of association.
.Finally, the Committee notes the important number of dismissals of activists for trade union activities which took place in many enterprises: the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) (because these workers were members or sympathizers of the Trade Union of Workers, Employees and Temporary Workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (SOETRATEC), were exercising legitimate trade union activities, were taking trade union training courses, or were members of the executive board of this union); the National Electric Company; the Teleco Telephone Company; the ""Home of Champions"" Company; the Michico Company; the ""Chanarelles"" Manufacturing Company. In this respect, the Committee must insist on the need to ensure respect of the principle according to which workers must benefit from adequate protection against acts of discrimination which may violate freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to enable all the workers dismissed for legitimate trade union activities to be reinstated in their jobs.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, in condemning the serious violations of freedom of association by the military authorities which were exercising control in Haiti, including murders, arrests, torture, abductions and the dismissal of trade unionists, as well as the establishment of organizations by the military authorities to replace the existing legitimate trade unions, and violations of trade unionists' freedom to hold meetings, to demonstrate and to carry out information and training activities, trusts that the present Government of Haiti, will ensure respect for the principles of freedom of association which have been violated, and that it will take the measures necessary to remedy the consequences of the acts which are the subjects of the complaints.(b) Considering the scope of the issues involved, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any inquiries concerning the violent deaths, arrests and torture of trade unionists, and in particular the measures taken to apply effective sanctions in the event these allegations are proven.(d) The Committee further requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it will take to enable the reinstatement in their posts of all the workers dismissed for their legitimate trade union activities and to ensure for workers the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing without interference from the public authorities.",-1,1993,Haiti
18,".In Case No. , the initial complaint of the ICFTU of  November  concerned violations of human rights and trade union rights resulting from the military coup d'tat of September  which overthrew the democratically elected Government of Haiti. According to the ICFTU, hundreds of people, including many trade unionists, were murdered or disappeared following the coup d'tat. Many other trade union leaders and activists saved their lives by fleeing the country or by going into hiding. Trade union offices were ransacked and closed. The few trade union offices which stayed open were only able to do so because they remained extremely discreet. All the same, normal trade union activity was impossible, and it was necessary for personal reasons to recall the representative of the ICFTU in Haiti.
.The list of specific cases provided by the ICFTU is, according to this organization, in no way exhaustive in light of the fact that obtaining information and testimony in Haiti was extremely difficult because of the risk of jeopardizing the safety of the people concerned. These examples none the less demonstrate the brutal and merciless repression carried out against the democratic trade union movement by the illegitimate Government and the military authorities in Haiti:- On  October , Joseph Manucy Pierre, the information secretary of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), was arrested in the Confederation's premises by army officers. Following a quick international reaction, the army released him and withdrew the charges against him. To protect his life, Mr. Manucy went into hiding.- The General Independent Organization of Haitian Workers (OGITH) closed its offices on  September  and reopened them only recently for limited activities. Following an interview given by Mr. Schiller Marcelin, the General Secretary of the OGITH, to an American radio station in November , army officers warned the leaders of the OGITH that Mr. Marcelin's remarks were ""stupid and dangerous"". Mr. Marcelin decided to remain in the United States. Mr. Andr Franois, the Treasurer of the OGITH, also took refuge in the United States after he was threatened by the military.- Teachers affiliated with the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) have been harassed and intimidated by the military. Many have been transferred to other schools, and the homes of some others have been burned in arson attacks. The trade union leaders of the CNEH have gone into hiding and the Confederation's headquarters have been closed.- On  November  soldiers tried to abduct Daniel Lubin, one of the trade union leaders of the CNEH, who was outside the headquarters. He was able to flee.- On  January , Jean-Claude Museau, a member of the CNEH and a teacher in Les Cayes, was abducted by army officers when they discovered that he had in his possession literature in favour of President Aristide. They tortured him, forcing him to swallow the documents in question. Mr. Museau died on  January  as a consequence of this torture.- On  March , Parnel Boyer, a member of the CNEH, narrowly escaped from his house, which was burned down in an arson attack. Witnesses said that members of the army set the fire.- On  March, a demonstration organized by the FENEH (students' federation) at the Education Faculty (State University) was violently dispersed by the army. Messrs. Bernard Canatus and Edrice St. Amand, teachers who supported the FENEH action, were wounded.- On  May, a number of students who were members of the FENEH gathered at the Faculty of Human Sciences (a department of the State University) to express their grievances. Several military squads broke into the campus, fired shots and seriously injured some of the demonstrators. Many students were arrested. During the incident, some soldiers searched for Mr. Camille Chalmers in the buildings of the university. Mr. Chalmers is known as an adviser to the Trade Union of Electricity Workers and was accused of being the instigator of the students' gathering. He was badly beaten in front of witnesses and subsequently arrested. After three hours of interrogation, he was released. He suffered head injuries.- On  May, Patrick Morisseau, a teacher and trade unionist, was arrested by the police in Port-au-Prince. The same night, his mother, Mrs. Claire Eduard, was murdered. Her sister Suzette, as well as the Secretary of the women's branch of the OGITH, Marie Carline Philisias, were threatened and harassed.- In a radio programme on the night of  May, the government radio station divulged the names of five teachers. The government employees working at this radio station accused them of being the main instigators of demonstrations organized by students at public schools and of supporting the political opposition. These accusations were a serious and deliberate threat for the people concerned, who have since gone into hiding. Because of this threat, Jean Raynold Pierre, Robert Beausil, Wilfrid Menthor, Daniel Fignole, Saint Amour Firmin and Mrs. Henri fear for their lives.- In a memorandum published in July  in the newspaper Le Matin, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) condemned acts of violence committed at universities, and in particular the violent incidents which took place at the Faculty of Medicine, during which some students were taken hostage and a number were beaten. Mr. Blaise, a young member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Students (FENEH), was seriously injured. According to the CNEH, the repression had never been so serious.- The military government reportedly set up a new ""union"" of workers under the name of ASTRE at Teleco, the telephone company, to replace the legitimate trade union already existing there. Trade union leaders and trade unionists of the democratic trade union SOETEL were dismissed.- The military government also forcibly replaced the trade union leaders of the journalists' union, AJH. The union was dismantled through acts of harassment and intimidation committed against its leaders, and the new pro-military leaders condemned the legitimate leaders in speeches made on the radio.- The Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH) was particularly singled out by the army. Its members were harassed, threatened and dismissed. One of its members was murdered. Jean Delince Josma, a member of the FESTREDH, was reportedly murdered by the army in October. Shortly after the coup d'tat of September, the army broke into buildings of the National Electric Company, threatening and harassing members of the FESTREDH. The director of the company, who had just been named, refused to follow the army's orders to dismiss the trade union leaders, and was dismissed himself. Subsequently,  members of the FESTREDH were dismissed in mid-December . On  December , two trade union leaders of the FESTREDH, Abel Pointdujour and Evans Saintune, were arrested when they tried to negotiate compensation for the company's workers who had been dismissed after the coup d'tat. They were only released three days later, after having been interrogated about their supposed political links and been advised that they should, in the interest of their own safety, leave the country. During these three days, their homes were also searched. Two months later, they were able to take refuge in Canada, where they requested political asylum. The General Secretary went into hiding after having discovered that his name was on a list of trade union leaders and leaders of grass-roots organizations sought by the army. A jeep belonging to the trade union and used by trade union leaders to maintain contact with their members in the countryside was destroyed by the army.- In January, two other leaders of the FESTREDH were arrested and harassed by the army. Delamain Ambroise and Raynald Garnier were abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention. They were subsequently released and dismissed from their jobs. On  April , several members of the executive and two trade union representatives, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were severely beaten by the army. From the month of September on, all the members of the executive and the FESTREDH were dismissed because of their trade union activities.- Farmers' trade unions have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment from the military. On  May , Jacques Joseph, the President of the CLAM, a farmers' trade union affiliated with the OGITH, and his wife were arrested and severely beaten. They were accused of leading a demonstration calling for the return of President Aristide. They were later released.- At the beginning of May, Daniel Pierre, the President of the UDTL, a trade union of farmers in Boukan Michel which is affiliated with the OGITH, was detained by the section chief, Yvon Verdieu. Mr. Pierre was threatened and prohibited until further notice from holding trade union meetings in the absence of the section chief.- On  May, Thermilien Pierre, a member of an agricultural workers' organization affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested and beaten for having shouted: ""Yes to the embargo!""- The Association of Agricultural Workers of Artibonite, which is affiliated with the Federation of Haitian Workers (FTH), was warned that it was no longer authorized, until further notice was given by the police, to",-1,1992,Haiti
19,"hold trade union meetings. The trade union leaders did not meet any more, as they feared for their safety.- The harassment of trade unions spread to a number of enterprises under the protection of the army in the private sector. On  and  May,  trade union leaders were dismissed from ""Home of Champions"", a US enterprise which produces baseballs and which is located in Cit Soleil. One month later, four other trade union leaders were also dismissed by the enterprise. When the director of the enterprise called the trade union leaders into his office to inform them of their dismissal, he stated that ""this is not the right time to be a trade unionist"".- The trade union leaders employed by three other US enterprises were also dismissed. They too reported anti-trade union statements made by management. Nine trade unionists were dismissed from the ""Michico"" enterprise which produces textile products, and eight from the ""Chancerelles Manufacturing"" enterprise which produces women's lingerie.- The management of the US ""Automatic Accusonic"" enterprise had a different but just as effective approach to destroying the enterprise's trade union. The factory was temporarily closed, and when it reopened it was declared a ""union-free"" company. None of the trade union leaders or trade unionists were re-employed. When the President of the trade union asked for them to be reinstated, he was severely beaten and his arm was broken.
.The ICFTU later sent supplementary information, which was obtained during a mission to Haiti from  to  January , reporting that the trade unionist Cajuste Lexinste, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Workers, Phabonord Saint Vil, the secretary of the organization, and Sauveur Orlus, the CGT's General Secretary in Gros Morne, were arrested on  April  and transferred to the main anti-gang squad, where they were tortured because they wanted to distribute a press release to protest against the arrest of several members of the CGT in Gros Morne.
.Furthermore, according to the ICFTU, on  February  more than  workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) were dismissed for having taken union training courses organized by the Trade Union of Workers, Employees and Temporary Workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (SOETRATEC). On  November  the members of the executive of this trade union had already been dismissed. Finally, on  March , Joseph Michelet, a member of the trade union of workers of Larco Frres SA, a union affiliated with the OGITH, was arrested, subjected to intensive interrogation on the Haitian crisis, and then released.

Many of their members have been arrested or tortured, or have disappeared. Namely, there have been the following cases:- On  October , Pierre Andr Mertyl was tortured. There has still been no response to the complaint filed by the lawyers of the CTH (Confederation of Haitian Workers).- On  December , Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm in Jrmie, was tortured for no reason by Joseph Jean-Franois, a corporal in the army, and by Kesnel Guerrier.- On  January , Baselet Derival, a member of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers, was arrested, imprisoned and tortured. He was held at the Faustin Soulouque barracks in Petit-Goave.- Pierre Trechelet, the brother of a member of the Executive Committee of the CTH, has been reported missing.- On  January , Raynold Belizaire, a member of the FENATIS, was shot twice while he was in his private home.- On  January , Estimable Jean-Emile, a correspondent of Radio Cacique and a member of the Democratic Youth Movement (affiliated with the Young Farmers' Association of Plagie-AJPL, which is an association under the FENATAPA) was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Mr. Gls, the head of the third section of Marchand Dessalines.

On  January , Jean Elder Almeus, a member of the ATPGA (Newspaper Workers' Association of Grand'Anse), was arrested while he participated in the ""Truth on the Drum"" programme broadcast by Radio Vision.
.Finally, on  December , during the arrest of three active members of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers and Haitian Farmers (FENATAPA) (they have since been released), audiovisual material including inter alia equipment and documents used for training of the rural population was confiscated by second-lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Ravix.

The complainant organization points out that on  March  the SOETRATEC sent a letter to the director of the labour service of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but that nothing was done in response to this letter.
.CLAT, for its part, denounces the grenade attack in Jrmie on  June  of which Serge Paul, an important leader of the Confederation of Haitian Workers (CTH), was reportedly a victim. This attack reportedly led to the death of his two children and seriously injured a third child. CLAT adds that this union leader and six of his collaborators were reportedly arrested while organizing a seminar in Jrmie. Furthermore, the Deputy Secretary-General of the CTH, Louis Octave Dorvilier, was reportedly held by four armed individuals; he was abducted into a van blindfolded, kicked, tortured and then abandoned. The General-Secretary himself, Jean-Claude Lebrun, was reportedly threatened. Finally, three members of an organization in Marceline (Cap Perin South), Gerthin Augustin, Gabriel Louine and Romain Castra were abducted into a van, license number , on a road in Ption Villi; their whereabouts are as yet unknown.

.The Committee recalls that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists and with respect for basic human rights (see Digest of decisions and principles of the",-1,1992,Haiti
20,"Committee on Freedom of Association, rd edition, , paras.  and ). The Committee expresses the fervent hope that the Government will ensure respect of these principles.
.The Committee notes with deep concern the allegations according to which the trade unionist of the Trade Union of Electricity Workers (FESTREDH), Jean Delince Josma, was reportedly murdered by members of the army in October , the trade unionist of the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers, Jean-Claude Museau, was reportedly abducted by members of the army and tortured to death on  January , the trade unionist, Camille Chalmers, of the Trade Union of Electricity Workers, was beaten, arrested and interrogated for three hours, the trade unionists of the same union, Ambroise Delamain, Raynald Garnier, Patrice Cantave and Jonas Desinor, were reportedly abducted by unidentified policemen and beaten during their detention, the trade unionist of the agricultural union affiliated with the OGITH, Jacques Joseph, and his wife, as well as Thermilien Pierre, were reportedly arrested and severely beaten, the trade unionists of the General Confederation of Workers, Cajuste Lexinste, Phabonord Saint Vil and Sauveur Orelus, were reportedly arrested on  April  and tortured at the anti-gang squad, and the trade unionists, Pierre Andr Mertyl, of the Confederation of Haitian Workers, Webert Mars, a worker at the FENATAPA pig farm, Baselet Derival, of the Federation of Craftsmen and Professional Workers and Estimable Jean Emile of the Young Farmers' Association, were reportedly arrested and tortured respectively on  October ,  December ,  January  and  January .

It urges the Government to enable these unionists to return to the country and to carry out their trade union activities in full freedom.
.As regards the establishment by the military authorities of organizations to replace the existing legitimate trade unions, the Committee condemns such acts, which seriously violate the right of workers to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, and it recalls that the public authorities must abstain from any intervention which would limit the rights granted by Convention No. , which Haiti has ratified, or which would hinder the legal exercise of those rights.
.The Committee further recalls that the right to organize trade union meetings and to take trade union training courses is an essential element of freedom of association.
.Finally, the Committee notes the important number of dismissals of activists for trade union activities which took place in many enterprises: the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (CAMEP) (because these workers were members or sympathizers of the Trade Union of Workers, Employees and Temporary Workers of the Metropolitan Clean Water Treatment Plant (SOETRATEC), were exercising legitimate trade union activities, were taking trade union training courses, or were members of the executive board of this union); the National Electric Company; the Teleco Telephone Company; the ""Home of Champions"" Company; the Michico Company; the ""Chanarelles"" Manufacturing Company. In this respect, the Committee must insist on the need to ensure respect of the principle according to which workers must benefit from adequate protection against acts of discrimination which may violate freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to enable all the workers dismissed for legitimate trade union activities to be reinstated in their jobs.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee, in condemning the serious violations of freedom of association by the military authorities which were exercising control in Haiti, including murders, arrests, torture, abductions and the dismissal of trade unionists, as well as the establishment of organizations by the military authorities to replace the existing legitimate trade unions, and violations of trade unionists' freedom to hold meetings, to demonstrate and to carry out information and training activities, trusts that the present Government of Haiti, will ensure respect for the principles of freedom of association which have been violated, and that it will take the measures necessary to remedy the consequences of the acts which are the subjects of the complaints.(b) Considering the scope of the issues involved, the Committee reminds the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is at its disposal.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of any inquiries concerning the violent deaths, arrests and torture of trade unionists, and in particular the measures taken to apply effective sanctions in the event these allegations are proven.(d) The Committee further requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures it will take to enable the reinstatement in their posts of all the workers dismissed for their legitimate trade union activities and to ensure for workers the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing without interference from the public authorities.",-1,1992,Haiti
21,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting of November  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). To date the Government has not sent its observations on the allegations made, and thus in its th Report (approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )) the Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present at its next meeting a report on the substance of the case, even if the information or observations from the Government had not been received in time.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations pending from the Committee's examination of this case in November  refer to the violent arrest on  November  of the trade union officials, Messrs. Jean Auguste Mesyeux, of the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH), Evans Paul de la Kid, an official of the Democratic Unity Confederation (CUD) and Etienne Marineau, a member of the "" September"" People's Organisation; attacks against the CATH headquarters and destruction of its furniture on  November  by individuals wearing military uniforms and against the premises of the Haitian Workers' Confederation (CTH) on  January ; the detention and subsequent disappearance on  January  of the President of the Trade Union Confederation of Public Transport (CSTP), Mr. Nally Bauharnais; the break-in into the home of the deputy secretary-general of the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) Mr. Andr L. Joseph, who is allegedly under constant surveillance and against whom death threats have been made and death threats against other officials of this organisation: Lourdes Edith Joseph, Evelyne Margron Bertoni, Guy Alexandre and Guy Lochard.
.The Committee notes with deep regret that after a previous examination of the case without the Government's response, and in spite of the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented and the repeated requests addressed to the Government that it furnish its comments and observations in this matter, the Government has failed to reply to the allegations of the complainant confederations.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the corresponding rule of procedure (see para.  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee must again submit a report on the substance of the matter, even in the absence of information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.First of all, the Committee reiterates to the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure set up in the ILO for the examination of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. If the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them. (See the Committee's First Report, para. .)
.The Committee notes that the allegations in the present case concern: () the arrest and detention of three trade unionists, and the ill-treatment to which they were subjected (Messrs. Mesyeux, Evans Paul de la Kid and Marineau); () the assault and sacking of the premises of the CATH; () the arrest and disappearance of a trade union leader, Mr. Bauharnais; () the sacking of the premises of the CTH; () the intimidation and threats to the lives of CNEH officials.
.In these circumstances the Committee wishes to stress that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are fully respected and guaranteed. As stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties. (See Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , paras.  and .)
.As regards the allegations, which the Government has not refuted, according to which three trade union leaders were arrested and subjected to torture and ill-treatment while they were preparing to exercise their trade union functions, and are detained under the false accusation of conspiring against the Government, the Committee recalls that the arrest and detention of trade unionists and trade union leaders in the exercise of their activities or trade union rights constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association, and that such actions may create a climate of fear and intimidation which hampers the normal development of such activities.
.While workers and their trade unions should, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , respect the law of the land like other persons or organised collectivities (this Article also provides that the law of the land should not impair the guarantees provided for in the Convention), they must also benefit, as any other person, from proper legal procedures which conform with the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In particular, this means that they have the right: to be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for the same; to be informed as soon as possible of the accusations brought against them; to be brought promptly before a competent judge; to be held in preventive custody for the shortest possible period in order to facilitate a judicial inquiry; to have the time and facilities necessary for the preparation of their defence; to communicate without hindrance with the legal counsel of their choice and to be promptly judged by an impartial and independent judicial authority. These guarantees of proper judicial procedures should not only be expressed in legislation, but also, and especially, be applied in practice.
.Moreover, the Committee has often pointed out that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detainee is subject to ill-treatment, and that any person deprived of his liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. When there is evidence of such ill-treatment in spite of these instructions, governments should carry out inquiries to identify and punish the parties responsible for the same and impose effective and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions to prevent its recurrence, and take such measures as may be necessary to compensate the damages suffered by the victims. (See Digest, paras. -.)
.As regards the acts of intimidation and the threats made against the officials of the CNEH, the break-in into the home of its deputy general secretary and the surveillance to which he has been subjected, the anonymous threats to the lives of CTH officials, the assault and sacking of CATH premises by individuals wearing military uniforms, as well as the sacking of the CTH headquarters, the Committee notes that these are serious acts which reveal a general climate of violence and intimidation which is far from conducive to the normal exercise of trade union rights, and which call for energetic measures by the Government. In situations of this kind an independent judicial inquiry constitutes an appropriate means for clarifying the facts, identifying responsible parties, punishing the guilty parties and preventing the recurrence of such actions.
.Such a judicial inquiry is particularly called for in the event of the death or disappearance of an individual, as in the case of Mr. Bauharnais, whose whereabouts are still unknown since his arrest on  January .
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted a complaint alleging the violation of freedom of association against the Government of Haiti in a communication of  January . On  February  the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) forwarded to the ILO a communication dated  January  from the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH) containing similar allegations of violations of freedom of association during the same period. Since then, the Government has furnished no information or observations concerning this complaint, in spite of the repeated requests that it do so.
.At its May-June  meeting, the Committee noted that in spite of the time elapsed since the complaint had been filed, it had received no observations from the Government; the Committee drew to the attention of the Government that, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph  of its th Report, it would examine the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the observations requested from the Government had still not been received.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to",-1,1990,Haiti
22,"Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU states that on  November  Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, Executive Secretary of the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH), was violently arrested by members of the Presidential Guard while preparing to engage in his trade union functions. He was accompanied by Evans Paul de la Kid (an official of the Democratic Unity Confederation) and Etienne Marineau (a member of the "" September"" People's Organisation). Brutally questioned by these members of the Presidential Guard, they were forced to confess on the spot that they were transporting arms which, according to many witnesses, had been placed in the suspects' vehicle by the members of the Guard themselves. These events took place a few days before the CATH called for a general strike.
.On  November  the authorities presented the arrested trade unionists on television; they showed signs of ill-treatment and torture. They are currently being held in the national prison under the false charge of conspiring against the Government.
.On  November , on the eve of a strike, the CATH headquarters were assaulted by individuals wearing military uniforms, who destroyed all furniture and office equipment.
.Nally Bauharnais, president of the Trade Union Confederation of Public Transport (CSTP), was arrested in Port-au-Prince on the night of - January . His whereabouts remain unknown.
.During the night of - January , the premises of the Haitian Workers' Confederation (CTH) were sacked and smeared with excrement, and the walls were covered with inscriptions such as ""Avril for five years"". The Confederation's leading officials received anonymous threats. At present, it seems as though the situation is deteriorating. The Government has decreed a state of siege and is availing itself of this opportunity to harass and intimidate the trade union movement with impunity.
.In a communication of  Feburary  transmitted on behalf of the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers (CNEH), the WCOTP states that freedom of association is neither respected nor recognised in Haiti. The CNEH is directly targeted and the lives of its leaders are in danger. The home of its deputy general secretary, Andr L. Joseph, was broken into during his absence and he is under surveillance by unidentified individuals. Anonymous telephone calls have been received at CNEH headquarters by persons threatening the lives of confederation officials unless they cease their activities. The names most frequently mentioned during the course of these anonymous threatening phone calls are those of: Andr Lafontant Joseph, Lourdes Edith Joseph, Evelyne Margron Bertoni, Guy Alexandre and Guy Lochard, all officials of the CNEH.
.The Committee notes with deep regret that, in spite of the time elapsed since the complaint was filed, and in spite of repeated requests addressed to the Government that it furnish its comments and observations in this matter, the Government has failed to reply to the allegations of the complainant confederations.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the corresponding rule of procedure (see para.  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee must submit a report on the substance of the matter, even in the absence of information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.

.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not furnished its comments or observations on the serious allegations in this matter.(b) The Committee deplores the failure of the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that trade unions, their leaders and members, may exercise their activities in a climate of respect for civil liberties and fundamental human rights.(c) The Committee requests the Government to furnish information on the grounds for the arrest and detention of Messrs. Mesyeux, Evans Paul de la Kid and Marineau, and on the measures taken to identify and punish those responsible for the torture and ill-treatment to which these persons were allegedly subjected. In addition, it urgently requests the Government to specify what accusations",-1,1990,Haiti
23,"have been brought against these persons, immediately to release those against whom no charges have been brought, and to ensure that the others are judged promptly by an independent and impartial tribunal, and that they enjoy all judicial guarantees, and as soon as possible to communicate to the Committee the text of the judgements, in order that it may proceed with the examination of the allegations in full knowledge of the facts.(d) The Committee notes with deep concern that the Government has not yet furnished information concerning the acts of intimidation and violence denounced by the complainants. It urgently requests the Government to institute independent judicial inquiries to look into the facts, to punish the guilty parties and to prevent the repetition of such actions, and to keep it informed of the results of inquiries into:- the arrest and disappearance, on  January , of Nally Bauharnais;- the attack on the premises of CATH and CTH;- the threats to the lives of, and the measures of surveillance and harassment against, the leaders of the CATH, CTH and CNEH.",-1,1990,Haiti
24,".The pending complaints in the present case were presented in November  and in June and July . Despite the numerous requests addressed to it by the Committee, the Government had provided no comments on the issues raised. Consequently, the Committee, after having noted that the observations requested on a number of occasions had not been received and after having addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to transmit its observations, drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in, it would present a report at its next meeting on the substance of this case, even if the observations requested from the Government had not been received in time.
.At its March  meeting, in the absence of any reply from the Government, the Committee was called upon to examine this case and presented an interim report on the substance of the matter to the Governing Body (see the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.Moreover, in accordance with a decision of the Committee, its Chairman, Mr. Roberto Ago, met Haiti's Government delegation during the  International Labour Conference. During this meeting it was decided that the mission examining the implementation of the recommendations made in  by the Commission of Inquiry regarding Haitian workers on the sugar plantations of the Dominican Republic would also discuss questions raised by the present case. This mission arrived in Haiti in October , and the Committee proposes to examine the case in light of the information compiled by it on the spot.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations made in the present case essentially concern anti-trade union reprisals by employers against workers who were seeking to carry out legitimate trade union activities, the arrests of trade union leaders and activists specifically named by the complainant following a two-day strike in , the dissolution by administrative decision of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), notwithstanding the subsequent revocation of this dissolution, the violent occupation of the CATH's premises and the confiscation of trade union assets belonging to it. In the absence of any denial of these allegations by the Government, the Committee was at the time obliged to conclude that a serious violation of the principles of freedom of association had occurred.
.In March , the Governing Body upon the recommendation of the Committee, after having deplored the lack of co-operation from the Government in this affair, requested it:- to ensure that the material and money of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers, which were confiscated during the attack on the headquarters of the Confederation on  June  (a car, office equipment and a sum of money), be returned to the CATH;- to take severe measures to eliminate the danger involved in trade union activities, the arrest of trade unionists following strikes, and the ill-treatment and other punitive measures reportedly inflicted on them, and to indicate whether judicial inquiries had been instigated into the ill-treatment inflicted on the imprisoned trade unionists;- to endeavour to bring about the reinstatement of the many workers dismissed for having wanted to conduct legitimate trade union activities, including the creation of trade union organisations within their enterprises.
.The mission met trade union representatives concerned with this case in Haiti. They noted that many of the assets taken by the armed forces after the attack on the CATH's premises on  June  were not returned. This included a photocopying machine, three typewriters, three motorcycles, , dollars and the organisation's records. Some equipment was returned, but it was completely broken and unusable.
.According to the trade union representatives, the workers dismissed for wanting to carry out legitimate trade union activities have not been reinstated, and eight CATH activists who suffered ill-treatment when arrested on  June  are still ill and depend on the CATH for the payment of their medical care. No judicial inquiries have been instigated regarding the allegations of ill-treatment.
.The trade union representatives went on to allege that freedom of association in the country is only a facade, that no standard guaranteeing freedom of association is respected, that employers do not respect freedom of association and are condoned in doing so by the authorities and that workers are still dismissed for trade union activities. The trade union representatives also generally denounced the corruption which is rampant among inspectors and in labour courts, noting that some cases have been pending since  without the workers concerned receiving any salary, allowance or pension, that peasants' federations affiliated to the CATH have been waiting for two years to be registered, and that two trade union premises have been destroyed by fire.
.The government authorities refuted these allegations, stating that all the confiscated assets had been returned to the CATH and that, as to the rest, the allegations could not be substantiated. However, the government authorities gave assurances that the reimbursement of the medical costs incurred by the union activists who had suffered ill-treatment could be reconsidered.
.Regarding the reinstatement of dismissed trade unionists, the government authorities emphasised that this is a matter for the labour courts to decide but they admitted that there was a difficulty here in so far as the courts impose only the payment of damages or fines and not the reinstatement of workers in their jobs. The authorities did not deny that there had been no judicial inquiry into the soldiers' behaviour to which the CATH was subjected on  June .
.During the on-the-spot mission, draft amendments to laws and regulations were drafted with the government authorities in order to bring the provisions of national legislation into conformity with Conventions Nos.  and , and the Government pledged that it would hold a national seminar on international labour standards in Haiti during .
.Until now the Committee has had to deplore the Government's serious default in its obligation to co-operate in the procedure. The Committee can only welcome the fact that the mission which went to Haiti was free to meet with the complainant national organisation as well as the government authorities, and was able to note that some developments in the field of freedom of association have taken place in the country.
.On the substance of the issues still pending, the Committee notes the information and observations submitted by the complainants as well as those of the Government. While observing in particular that, according to the complainants, freedom of association is still far from respected in practice, the Committee none the less notes several positive factors that point to an appreciable improvement in the trade union situation; for example, the dissolution of the CATH has been revoked, the detained trade unionists have been released and some of the assets confiscated from the CATH have been returned, albeit not always in good condition.
.As to the facts of the matter, the Committee notes with concern that trade union activists suffered ill-treatment during the events of June  and are still receiving medical care, and that this is a charge on the CATH. Considering the Government's assurance to the mission that the reimbursement of the medical costs incurred by the union activists who suffered ill-treatment during these events could be reconsidered, the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed on this point.
.As regards the reinstatement of workers dismissed for trade union activities, the Committee, while noting the Government's statement that this is a matter for the labour courts, can only firmly reiterate its previous conclusions, to wit, that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should benefit from adequate protection against all acts of discrimination liable to undermine freedom of association in employment, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of the founders of trade union organisations, since in order to carry out their functions they must have a guarantee that they will not suffer on account of the union office they stand for or hold.
.The Committee therefore again calls on the Government to endeavour to obtain the reinstatement of the workers dismissed for having attempted to found a trade union organisation, and urges the Government to keep it informed of any progress in this respect.
.As regards the legislative aspect of the case, the Committee notes that during the mission, draft amendments to laws and regulations were drafted in light of the comments of the Committee of Experts in order to bring the legislation into conformity with the ratified Conventions. The Committee hopes that the occupational organisations and the ILO will be consulted before the adoption of the above-mentioned draft and trusts that provisions in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  will be quickly adopted.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes that, contrary to what has occurred in the past, the Government has co-operated in the procedure by accepting the visit of an ILO",-1,1986,Haiti
25,"mission, which was able to note some developments with respect to freedom of association in the country, such as the revocation of the dissolution of the CATH, the release of the detained trade unionists and the return of some of the assets confiscated from the CATH.b) However, the Committee notes with concern that trade union activists were ill-treated during the events of June  and are still receiving medical care, and that this is a charge on the CATH. The Committee, noting that the Government's assurances to the mission that the reimbursement of these medical costs could be reconsidered, urges the Government to keep it informed on this point.c) As regards the workers who were dismissed for trade union activities, the Committee also notes with regret that the Government merely stated that this is a matter for the labour courts. The Committee again calls on the Government, in accordance with its international commitments by virtue of Article  of Convention No.  ratified by it, to take steps to ensure that workers are protected against acts of anti-trade union discrimination.d) The Committee therefore requests the Government to endeavour to obtain the reinstatement of the workers dismissed for having attempted to found a trade union organisation, and urges the Government to keep it informed of any progress in this respect.e) The Committee trusts that legislation in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  will be quickly adopted in consultation with the occupational organisations and with the ILO and draws the attention of the Committee of Experts to this aspect of this case.
.Complaints of violation of freedom of association have been presented by the following trade union organisations on the following dates: the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT):  November ; the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU):  June ; the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):  July ; and the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH):  July . The CLAT, the WFTU and the CATH have provided additional information in support of their complaints in communications dated  February,  July and  August , respectively.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee noted that the observations requested on a number of occasions from the Government had not been received. In these circumstances, the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to transmit its observations as a matter of urgency and drew its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, it could present a report at its next meeting on the substance of this case even if the observations requested from the Government have not been received in time. Since then, the ILO has received no reply from the Government.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the CLAT states that a great many enterprises have decided to inflict reprisals on new trade union organisations. According to the CLAT, they dismissed the officials of each trade union as soon as they had been democratically elected by the workers. The complainant organisation states that about  trade union officials of the Haitian confederation affiliated to it, the CATH-CLAT, were dismissed by their enterprises only because they had accepted trade union office. A complaint has been lodged on each of these cases with the Ministry of Labour, which has so far agreed to act as mediator only in the case of those enterprises which are willing to pay the compensation due.
.The CLAT specifies that many enterprises, including ""Mariette Industries"", have dismissed hundreds of workers without paying the statutory compensation for dismissal. CLAT missions have visited Haiti on several occasions since the change of government and have requested dialogue with government representatives, which, in the case of the Minister of Labour, never took place.
.In its communication of  February , the CLAT states that the Minister of Labour refused to take part in dialogue by cancelling a meeting with CLAT representatives which, by common consent, was to take place on  February . The CLAT alleges that the Ministry of Labour has still not approved legal recognition of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers of Haiti (FENATAPA), which has been pending since the previous year and which was promised by the Minister in November . The complainant organisation also refers to the dismissal of nearly all of its staff, and, in particular, of trade union officials and members by the ""Jebsa"" and ""Performance Footwear"" undertakings. In the case of the ""Jebsa"" enterprise, according to the CLAT, glaring injustices have taken place, and the workers demand that the lock-out be lifted in the enterprise and that the conditions of work and remuneration established by Haitian law be observed. The ""Performance Footwear"" enterprise, for its part, announced the closure of the premises it occupies, changed its name and took up activities in other premises under the name of another representative. In the CLAT's view, this measure not only runs counter to the legislation, but is aimed at destroying the trade union, which represents  per cent of the staff. The enterprise refused to take part in any dialogue, and the Ministry of Labour failed to take appropriate measures to seek solutions. According to the CLAT, these two situations are merely an example of what has become a habitual practice of Haitian employers, in glaring contradiction to the efforts being made to build and consolidate a genuinely democratic regime.
.In its communication of  June , the WFTU alleges that on  June the Government dissolved the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH) and imprisoned three officials of this organisation, including its Secretary-General, Jean-Auguste Mesyeux. The WFTU specifies that these repressive measures followed a general two-day protest organised by the CATH to pressure the Government into improving working and living conditions of workers in the country.
.Referring to the same case, the ICFTU explains in its communication of  July  that, on  and  June, the CATH called a -hour general strike, presenting economic and social claims and demanding observance of the Constitution and civil rights. According to the ICFTU, the army invaded CATH headquarters at dawn on  June and carried out a thorough search. The premises were closed and are still occupied by the army. Four trade union officials were arrested and savagely beaten, and the CATH was dissolved by the provisional government junta.
.The WFTU states in its communication of  July  that the three CATH officials arrested are Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, Armand Pierre and Edouard Pierre.
.The CATH provides further details on this case in its communication of  July . It explains that, after the union called a general strike on  and  June , the military authorities gave the order on  June to invade the premises of the Confederation, which they then pillaged, taking away a car, office equipment and US$,.
.The CATH adds that the soldiers violently beat the officials who were in the trade union premises, then, without a warrant, took them away to the Dessalines barracks, where, for  days, according to the CATH, they were beaten, tortured and humiliated. In addition, on  June, the CATH was dissolved.
.On  July, the lawyers of the CATH intervened with the court since, contrary to the provisions in force, the trade unionists detained had not been brought before a judge. On  July, the persons concerned were released on certain conditions.
.In its communication of  August , the CATH specifies that eight persons were arrested on  June. They were Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, Armand Pierre, Edouard Pierre, Jean-Baptiste Hatman, Jean-Claude Pierre-Louis, Idly Cameau, Patrice Dacius and Edmer Saint-Eloi. Since their release, these trade union officials and five other union officials have received various threats and have been entered on a government blacklist.
.The CATH adds that an arson attempt was made on its premises on the night of  to  July. Lastly, it states that the equipment, vehicle and money taken away during the army attack on its premises have still not been returned.
.Subsequently, the ILO has sent telegrams on several occasions to the Government requesting it to transmit its observations and comments on the outstanding allegations in this case. The Government has not to date responded to these requests. However, the Office was informed verbally by a Haitian trade union official passing through Geneva that the administrative dissolution of the CATH had been lifted. It was also informed of the release of several trade unionists whose arrest had been announced by the complainants.
.Before examining the substance of the case, the Committee regrets that it must draw the Government's attention to the considerations it set out in its First report (paragraph ), namely that the purpose of the whole procedure set up is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact; it is convinced that while the procedure protects governments against unreasonable",-1,1986,Haiti
26,"accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for their own reputation of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them.
.In these circumstances, the Committee deplores the fact that the Government has not replied to the serious allegations made by the complainants, some of which date back to more than a year ago, and that it is obliged because of the time which has elapsed, to examine the case without being able to take into account any observations or comments from the Government.
.The Committee points out that the allegations raised in this case mainly deal with anti-trade union reprisals inflicted by employers on workers seeking to conduct legitimate trade union activities, with the arrests of trade union activists and officials - named by the complainants - following a two-day strike in June , with the dissolution by administrative authority of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), with the occupation by violent means of the premises of this trade union confederation, and with the confiscation of the trade union material belonging to it.
.In the absence of any reply on these allegations by the Government, the Committee can only conclude that there has been a serious infringement of the principles of freedom of association.
.As concerns the anti-trade union reprisals, including dismissals and the alleged establishment of ""blacklists"" by employers which are said to have affected hundreds of workers merely because they wanted to set up trade union organisations or carry out legitimate trade union activities within several enterprises in Haiti, the Committee recalls that one of the basic principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination likely to infringe upon freedom of association in their employment. It also recalls that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions (See th Report, Case No.  (Jamaica), para.  and Case No.  (Costa Rica), para. .).
.The Committee therefore expresses its serious concern as regards this infringement of the principles of freedom of association and, as it has done on numerous occasions in similar cases, draws the Government's attention to the fact that the establishment of ""blacklists"" of trade union officials seriously endangers the free exercise of trade union rights, and it is incumbent on the Government to take measures so as to ensure the full respect for these principles.
.As regards the dissolution by administrative authority of the CATH, the Committee emphasises the importance it attaches to Article  of Convention No.  ratified by Haiti, according to which workers' and employers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority. In the Committee's opinion, dissolution by virtue of administrative powers does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee and which the Committee considers essential.
.Consequently, the Committee is of the opinion that dissolution by administrative authority constitutes a serious violation of the rights of workers' organisations contrary to Convention No. .
.The Committee has been informed that the dissolution of the CATH has been lifted. It nevertheless calls upon the Government to ensure that such practices are not repeated in the future.
.As regards the arrests and imprisonment of the CATH leaders and activists after a general two-day strike on  and  June , a strike called by the CATH to pressure, according to the complainants, the Government into improving working and living conditions of workers in the country, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic and social interests. In the Committee's opinion, the authorities should not have recourse to measures of imprisonment for the mere fact of organising or participating in a peaceful strike (See th Report, Case No.  (Greece), para. .).
.Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent authorities are given appropriate instructions so as to eliminate the danger to trade union activities that such arrests involve (See th Report, Case No.  (India), para. .).
.As regards the allegations concerning the ill-treatment and other punitive measures taken against the Haitian trade union activists and officials arrested after the above-mentioned general strike, the Committee has stressed in similar cases in the past the importance it attaches to the right of trade unionists, like all other persons, to enjoy the guarantees afforded by due process of law in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
.Consequently, the Committee considers that the Governments should give precise instructions to ensure that no detainee is subjected to such treatment and apply effective sanctions where cases of ill-treatment are proven.
.Concerning the allegation that the premises of the CATH were violently occupied and that trade union equipment, including a sum of money, was confiscated, the Committee recalls that the inviolability of trade union premises implies that the public authorities may not enter these premises without a judicial warrant authorising them to do so. Indeed, it is stated in the resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee also considers that measures of this nature involving the occupation of trade union premises and the confiscation of trade union property constitute a serious interference on the part of the Government in trade union activities and, as such, might give rise to criticism, unless they are accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period. The Committee therefore urges the Government to take the measures necessary so that the authorities concerned receive instructions to ensure respect for the law in this regard and to ensure that the union money allegedly taken away during the army attack be returned to the CATH.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee greatly deplores that the Government has not replied to the serious allegations submitted by the complainants in the present case concerning the repression to which the trade union movement in Haiti is being subjected; these allegations refer to hundreds of dismissals on the ground of trade union activities, the establishment of blacklists, the dissolution by administrative authority of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH) notwithstanding the fact that it has resumed its activities since the allegation was made, the arrest and detention of trade union officials and activists, the ill-treatment inflicted on these officials when detained and the violent occupation of the trade union premises and the confiscation of material belonging to the CATH.b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the material and money of the CATH, which were confiscated during the attack on the headquarters of the Confederation, be returned to that Confederation.c) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement cannot develop in a climate of violence and uncertainty.d) The Committee urges the Government to take severe measures to eliminate the danger which such reprehensible anti-union practices imply for trade union activities.e) The Committee also urges the Government to take the measures necessary to safeguard freedom of association and civil liberties in Haiti, in accordance with the obligations this country undertook in ratifying Conventions Nos.  and . It asks it in particular to endeavour to bring about the reinstatement of the many workers dismissed for having wanted to conduct legitimate trade union activities, and to indicate whether judicial inquiries have been instigated into the ill-treatment inflicted on the imprisoned trade unionists, the occupation of the CATH premises and the confiscations carried out on the premises in question. The Committee requests the Government to supply information in this connection.",-1,1986,Haiti
27,".The Committee already examined this case at its May  Session when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, the Government has supplied its observations in a letter dated  September .
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The initial complaint of the world Confederation of Labour (WCL) related primarily to the refusal to grant legal recognition to the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH) established in accordance with legal requirements, the occupation by the police of the headquarters of that Confederation, the confiscation of bank assets, the arrest on  December  of its Secretary-General, Mr. Yves Richard, his deportation to Curacao and the arrest of other trade union leaders. In addition, the complaint alleged that  workers had been dismissed without grounds from the National Brewery,  from the Textile Look factory and  from the Dress Martin factory.
.More recently, the WCL also alleged that the trade unionist Jean-Baptiste Simon was shot dead by the police force when leaving a trade union meeting and that  CATH trade unionists, whose names it supplied, had been imprisoned.
.At its May  Session, the Committee, having noted the partial observations supplied by the Government on certain aspects of the case, requested it, in the absence of information on other points, for its comments on the allegations relating to the death of Mr. Jean-Baptiste Simon, the imprisonment of  trade unionists mentioned by the complainant organisation, the breaking into trade union premises and the freezing of bank accounts.
.The Committee also noted in connection with the failure to recognise the CATH that this Confederation had not complied with the normal legal formalities provided for by the labour legislation but gathered that apparently it had in any case continued its activities without being registered.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government states that the provisions of the Labour Code governing the operation of trade union organisations are consistent with Convention No.  and that if the CATH has continued its activities without being registered, it has done so illegally and without having acquired trade union status at any time. No registered trade union has claimed to belong this Confederation, which appears to be only a project or wishful thinking on the part of its leaders, and in no case can its activities be equated to trade union activities.
.In reply to the various allegations made by the complainant organisation, the Government states, concerning the occupation of the CATH headquarters that, even if it were proved that premises had been occupied by the police, the premises in question could not have been the headquarters of a trade union. The Government further states that it does not see in what capacity this body could have been authorised to collect union dues or to open a bank account in the name of a trade union.
.Regarding the imprisonment of  CATH members whose names were communicated to it, the Government states that the inquiry it carried out showed that none of the workers in question were under arrest and that all were going about their usual occupations.
.Concerning the death on  December  of the trade unionist Jean-Baptiste Simon, the Government acknowledges that his death occurred during a police raid carried out, according to it, to suppress a plot against the internal security of the State. His death, the Government claims, was justified by his resistance to the police force and Mr. Simon, an active militant of the opposition and a notorious anarchist, was not a trade unionist since his name does not appear in any trade union files.
.Concerning the allegation that Mr. Yves Richard was Secretary-General of the CATH at the time of his arrest, the Government challenges the validity of Mr. Richard's claim to- that office since, under section () of the Labour Code, members of a trade union executive Committee are required to have been members of the trade for at least six months, a requirement that he did not fulfil. The Government adds that the activities held against the few persons who had formed the Confederation in question, without legal status, were subversive activities and that those persons threatened the internal security of the State. Consequently, the action taken against Mr. Yves Richard, allegedly Secretary-General of the CATH, could not have been taken because of his trade union activities or in violation of the legal provisions governing the operation of trade union organisations.
.Concerning the dismissal of  workers from the National Brewery,  from the Textile Look factory and  from the Dress Martin factory, the Government acknowledges that, according to the minutes drawn up by the Conciliation and Arbitration Department of the General Directorate of Labour, the workers dismissed from the National Brewery were dismissed on grounds of participation in an illegal strike, in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. An employment contract may be terminated on grounds of participation in an illegal strike without entailing any liability for the employer and without prejudice to the penalties that may be taken by the public authorities against the strikers. The dismissals in the other two enterprises, of  and  workers respectively, were due to fluctuations in production and administrative reasons warranting application of the provisions of the Code. Most of the dismissed workers in this case freely accepted the severance pay owing to them. The Government concludes that those who chose instead to bring a lawsuit for unfair termination of their contracts subsequently waived the action initiated and accepted the legal benefits owing to them.
.In this case, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) has based its complaint on the information it received from the Haitian national organisation affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), which in turn is affiliated to the WCL: the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), an organisation representing one of the tendencies of the country's trade union movement.
.The Committee recalls that this Confederation was refused registration of its by-laws by the administrative authorities on  June . It nevertheless observes that the CATH has continued to carry out de facto activities and that, according to the complainant, repressive action was subsequently taken against leaders and members of this organisation, including the death of a trade unionist, the arrest of numerous members and the deportation of its Secretary-General.
.The Government considers that the CATH has no legal existence since- it has not been registered and that in no case can its activities be equated to trade union activities.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall that, during its first meeting in January , it established the principle that it has full discretion to decide whether or not an organisation is to be regarded as an industrial association within the meaning of the ILO Constitution and that it does not consider itself bound by any national definition of this term. In the case in question, the Committee considers that the fact that a workers' organisation has not registered its by-laws, as may be required by national law, is not sufficient reason to make its Complaint irreceivable since the principles of freedom of association demand precisely that workers shall be enabled, without previous authorisation, to establish organisations of their own choosing.
.As to the substance, the Committee observes that repressive action was taken following an attempt to establish a trade union organisation and a meeting held by that organisation.
.In the Committee's opinion, the severity of the repressive action taken has created within that organisation an atmosphere of intimidation that can only be detrimental to the development of its activities and even perhaps to further steps required for obtaining legal status. Consequently, the Committee considers that the principle that workers should be able to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation has been violated.
.In these circumstances, the Committee deplores the violent death of Mr. Jean-Baptiste Simon who, according to the statements of the Secretary-General of the CATH, was a trade unionist leaving a union meeting at the time when he was killed, and the arrest, followed by deportation, of the Secretary-General of that organisation.
.The Committee notes that the  members of the CATH who were arrested are free. It nevertheless considers that the Government's statements do not contain a formal denial of the allegations of the complainant organisation that the persons in question had been arrested. On this point, the Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the principle that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no subsequent charge is brought may involve restrictions to freedom of association and that the authorities should take appropriate measures to prevent the dangers involved for trade union activities by measures of arrest.
.Regarding the dismissal of  strikers from the National Brewery, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, those workers were dismissed for having taken part in an illegal strike on this point, the Committee, after examining the national legislation in",-1,1981,Haiti
28,"force governing labour disputes, observes that sections ,  and  of the Labour Code contain provisions whereby legal exercise of the right to strike may be considerably restricted. Under this legislation, labour disputes may be settled by compulsory arbitration by the Higher Arbitration Board. The Committee has always regarded the right to strike as one of the essential means for protecting the economic interests of workers. The Committee has nevertheless acknowledged that this right may be restricted, and even prohibited, in certain essential services when a strike in those sectors might have highly prejudicial effects for the national community. However, it has held that this principle might well become meaningless if it were so interpreted as to permit prohibition of a strike in an undertaken not providing an essential service in the strict sense of the term, i.e. a service whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population. In the case in question, it does not seem to the Committee that the National Brewery is an essential service according to this criterion.
.Accordingly, the Committee considers that it would be appropriate for the Government to take steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:The Committee deplores the repressive action taken following an attempt to establish a trade union organisation, the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers, and in particular the violent death of Mr. Jean-Baptiste Simon who, according to the Secretary-General of that Confederation, was a trade unionist, the arrest and subsequent deportation of Mr. Yves Richard, Secretary-General of the CATH, an organisation affiliated to the complainant organisation, as well as the alleged arrest of numerous trade unionists. On this last point, however, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these persons are free.In this case, the Committee considers that the principle of freedom of association that workers should be able to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation has been violated by the measures adopted and wishes to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.Concerning the dismissal of  workers from the National Brewery accused of having taken part in an illegal strike, the Committee considers that the National Brewery can hardly be considered to be an essential service in the strict sense of the term.Consequently, in view of the importance which it attaches to the exercise of the right to strike as one of the essential means which workers should have for protecting their occupational interests, the Committee considers that it would be appropriate for the Government to take steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the workers dismissed and requests it to keep it informed of any steps it takes to that end.
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Haiti in a letter dated  January . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  March . Since then, the WCL sent additional information in support of its complaint on  March . This information was transmitted to the Government which has not yet supplied detailed observations on this further information.
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL states that the Ministry of Labour has refused legal recognition of the Autonomous Confederation of Haitian Workers (CATH), set up in conformity with the legal requirements, and that several of its leaders have been arrested or deported from the country after having been mistreated.
.The complainant further states that the General Secretary of CATH, Mr. Yves Richard, was arrested, taken to the Presidential Palace, questioned, beaten and then expelled to Curaao. Several journalists and trade union and political leaders have suffered the same treatment, in particular, Joseph Lafontant, Sylvio Claude, Harold Isaac, Gregorie Eugne and Jean Dominique. Thousands of workers, adds the complainant, are now in prison or have sought refuge in embassies and in the Dominican Republic.
.According to the complainant, the headquarters of CATH was broken into by the Haitian police, its equipment and documentation was stolen and its bank accounts were frozen.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that  workers have been dismissed without reason from the national brewery, six from the ""Textile Look"" factory and three from the ""Dress Martin"" establishment.
.In its letter of  March , the WCL adds that, on  December , the trade unionist Simeon Jean Baptiste was shot dead by government forces while attending a trade union meeting. It also encloses a statement by Mr. Yves Richard, General Secretary of CATH, describing his arrest on  December and the poor prison conditions, and requesting the release of  named CATH members who are in prison.
.The Government states, as regards the allegation of refusal to recognise CATH, that on  June  the Ministry of Social Affairs wrote to that organisation pointing out certain procedural problems with its request for registration, such as non-compliance with section  of the Labour Code which requires the lodging of a complete list of its affiliated trade unions, and requesting compliance before registration could be granted. This letter, a copy of which the Government supplies, was never replied to, and thus the Government maintains that the organisation was never legally formed.
.Concerning the allegation of arrest of political and trade union leaders, the Government explains that Mr. Yves Richard was detained for political and subversive activities quite distinct from the exercise of trade union activities. As for Messrs. Joseph Lafontant, Sylvio Claude, Harold Isaac, Gregorie Eugne and Jean Dominique, the Government states that, as far as it is aware, they have no connection with the Haitian trade union movement; as for the thousands of workers alleged to be in prison or to have taken refuge in embassies or neighbouring countries, the Government also states that there is no evidence that this was done because of attempts to limit their trade union rights.
.The Government points out that the cases of the  dismissed workers have been submitted to the Labour Court in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code; some of the workers who had complained decided freely to reject judicial action and accepted severance pay from their employers. According to the Government, none of these workers belonged to a legally recognised union.
.On  April , the Government stated that the questions raised in the WCL's communication dated  March  were the responsibility of the ministry of the Interior and National Defence and it pointed out that it would not fail to send the relevant information subsequently.
.This case concerns allegations of non-recognition of a trade union organisation, arrests, maltreatment and expulsion of trade union leaders and members, interference with trade union premises and bank accounts and unjustified dismissal of  workers.
.As regards the recognition of a trade union organisation, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that this could not be done because the organisation concerned had not complied with certain legal formalities set out in the Labour Code. The Committee notes that these formalities (section  of the Code) do not appear to be onerous and that the organisation seems to have continued its activities even without the advantages that are commensurate with registration under the Code.
.Concerning the alleged arrests, maltreatment and expulsion of trade union leaders and members, the Committee notes the Government's statement that none of the leaders were connected to trade unions in Haiti, and that no measures had been taken against them for trade union activities. The Committee would recall that, in the past, it has expressed its view with regard to the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, might, nevertheless, affect the exercise of such rights. In the present case, it is important to point out that measures of preventive detention may involve a serious interference with trade union activities which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious situation or emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period; especially where there are allegations of ill-treatment of detainees, the Committee has stressed the importance of carrying out an inquiry into the facts in order to establish responsibilities and of taking appropriate action, in particular, to give precise instructions and apply effective sanctions so as to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment.
.In relation to the allegation of interference with trade union premises and bank accounts, the Committee notes that the Government has not commented thereon. Nevertheless it considers it important to recall that the occupation of trade union premises and the freeze of union bank accounts may constitute a serious interference by the authorities in trade union activities, as it has stated in the past, and consequently may run counter to the principle that",-1,1981,Haiti
29,"trade unions have the right to organise their activities and to the legal exercise thereof without hindrance by the public authorities. Furthermore, the International Labour conference, in its  Resolution concerning Trade Union Rights and their Relation to Civil Liberties, placed special emphasis on the right to protection of trade union property. The Committee would appreciate receiving any observations that the Government might wish to make in this respect.
.As for the dismissal of  workers, the Committee notes the Government's statement that those who so wished have had their cases reviewed by the Labour Court in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code, and those who decided to reject judicial action have freely accepted severance pay from their employers. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the specific reasons behind the dismissals and on the results of the appeals brought by some of the dismissed workers.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:Regarding the allegations concerning the death of Mr. Simeon Jean Baptiste and the imprisonment of  trade unionists mentioned by the complainant, the Committee requests the Government to supply its observations.Regarding the non-recognition of a trade union organisation, the Committee notes that this organisation did not comply with the normal legal formalities provided for in the legislation and, in any case, apparently carried on its activities without registration.As regards the alleged arrests, maltreatment and expulsion of trade union leaders and members, the Committee would draw the Government's attention to the principles that measures of preventive detention may involve a serious interference with trade union activities and that there should be an inquiry and appropriate action taken where there are allegations of ill-treatment of detainees.As regards the alleged interference with trade union premises and freezing of bank accounts, the Committee notes that the Government makes no comment, and while drawing its attention to the importance of the right to protection of trade union funds and property, would ask it to send any observations that it might have in this respect.Regarding the alleged dismissal of  workers the Committee requests the Government to supply information on the specific reasons behind the dismissals and on the results of the appeals brought by some of the dismissed workers.",-1,1981,Haiti
30,".The Committee already examined this case at its February  Session, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, the Government sent certain information in a letter of  March .
.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By communications dated  September and  October , the Union of Haitian Workers, the headquarters of which is in New York, presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Haiti. For its part the Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Haiti has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint of the Union of Haitian Workers concerns the disappearance of an active trade unionist. The complainant alleges in its two communications that Rmy Alexis, a member of the ""Association of Haitian Chauffeurs-Guides"" trade union, was secretly kidnapped whilst he was at the local headquarters of the abovementioned association, where his car remained parked. Inquiries undertaken to clarify the situation have proved fruitless. Rmy Alexis worked at Port-au-Prince. The complainant goes on to say that, although Mr. Alexis's car was parked in the courtyard of the Association of Chauffeurs-Guides between  and  April , no member of the office was able to give any information as concerns the date and time when the vehicle was driven to this place.
.The complainant adds that, over and above this particular case, the total absence of freedom of association constitutes a major obstacle to trade unions in Haiti: workers' organisations which operate within the country cannot maintain contact with the international unions or groups of affiliated trade unions which would be able to provide them with support affiliation of any kind is prohibited under the policy of the Government.
.In its reply, the Government states that it has reported the facts concerning the disappearance of Rmy Alexis to the steering Committee of the Association of Chauffeur-Guides of Haiti of which the missing trade unionist was a member. Attached to its reply the Government supplies the explanations given by this association on  October  indicating that the latter was informed of the disappearance of the missing trade unionist by members of his family and that it knew nothing of the circumstances in which Mr. Alexis had disappeared. Indeed, no member of the association had witnessed the disappearance, which could not have taken place at the local headquarters of the organisation without the knowledge of the trade union officials. However, although the association hopes that the competent authorities which are pursuing their inquiries will be able to clarify the situation, it maintains that the affair can in no way be connected with any infringement of trade union rights.
.The Government for its part states that it has informed the Ministry of the Interior and National Defence of the complaint and that it will transmit any reply which it receives on the case. The Government has not noted any instance of discrimination against this active trade unionist on account of his trade union activities.
.The Committee notes that, although the Association of Chauffeurs-Guides of Haiti of which the victim was a member states that it knows nothing of the circumstances of the disappearance, it affirms that it is not a trade union matter. However, since the Government has indicated that it will transmit any report which is received from the Ministry of the Interior and National Defence on the matter, the Committee wishes to be kept informed of any development in the situation which may occur.
.Further, the Committee notes that the Government does not provide any information on the allegation that the trade union organisations operating within the country may not remain in contact with international trade unions or groups of affiliated unions.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any development in the situation concerning the disappearance of Rmy Alexis.The Committee also requests the Government to furnish its observations on the allegations concerning the difficulties encountered by the trade unions as regards their affiliation and contacts with international trade union organisations.",-1,1980,Haiti
31,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its th, th, th and nd Sessions, held respectively in November , February , May  and February , on which occasions interim reports were presented to the Governing Body, which approved them. At its February  session the Committee examined the only allegation remaining outstanding, which related to the arrest of trade union leaders and militants.
.The complainants alleged that the Government had arbitrarily arrested a number of trade union leaders and militants. Among the persons arrested, it was stated, were Messrs. Ulrick Joly, President of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti-which had been dissolved - Claude Franois and Lon Gabriel, members of the Executive Committee of the organisation mentioned and presidents of the cement and sugar unions respectively, Messrs. Alcius Cadet and Arnold Maisoneuve, of the Dockers' Union, and the trade union leaders Messrs. Prossoir and Guerrior.
.At its February  session the Committee took note of a statement by the Government to the effect that if the persons concerned were not discharged as an act of mercy before the verdict of the court by which they were to be tried, a copy of the text of the judgment pronounced by the court should be communicated to the Committee. The Committee accordingly recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to be good enough to let the Governing Body know whether the persons mentioned by the complainants had or had not been discharged as an act of mercy and, if they had not, to communicate the text of the judgment or judgments delivered, with the text of the grounds therefor.
.In a communication dated  February  the Government states that the persons concerned, who had been imprisoned for subversive activities, had, before the court pronounced judgment, been discharged in consequence of a general act of mercy on the part of the President of the Republic and that they had all been released.
.In these circumstances the Committee, considering that it would be purposeless to pursue the matter further, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.This case has already been examined by the Committee at its th, th and th Sessions, held respectively in November , February  and May , on which occasions interim reports were presented to the Governing Body, which approved them, At its May  Session the Committee examined the only allegation remaining outstanding, which related to the arrest of trade union leaders and militants.
.The complainants alleged that the Government had arbitrarily arrested a number of trade union leaders and militants. Among the persons arrested, it was stated, were Mr. Ulrick Joly, President of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti (U.I.H.)-which had been dissolved -Messrs. Claude Franois and Len Gabriel, members of the Executive Committee of the organisation mentioned and presidents of the cement and sugar unions respectively, Messrs. Alcius Cadet and Arnold Maisoneuve, of the Dockers' Union, and the trade union leaders Messrs. Prossoir and Guerrior.
.At its May  Session the Committee took note of an extract, furnished by the Government, from the minutes of the Registry of the Port-au-Prince Civil Court, which indicated that, as the preliminary inquiry undertaken into the activities of the persons mentioned by name by W.F.T.U had shown that there were "" sufficient charges and evidence against them "", the examining magistrate had decided on  January  "" to remand the accused to the court of competent jurisdiction "".
.In these circumstances the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to be good enough to communicate to it the text of the judgment concerning the persons concerned, when this had been delivered, and of its grounds.
.The Governing Body approved this recommendation at its nd Session, on  May , and the complementary information mentioned in the preceding paragraph was requested from the Government in a letter dated  June , to which the Government replied by a communication dated  September .
.In this communication the Government states that no police measures have ever been taken against a workers' organisation or its members when their activities have been limited to genuine trade union action. However, it states that when under cover of trade union activities individuals receiving orders from abroad take it upon themselves to upset the established social order, it is necessary, in the common interest, to take the appropriate legal measures against them.
.As regards the case of the members of U.I.H, continues the Government, all persons who were found by the inquiry to have had nothing to do with the subversive plots of the Executive Committee of U.I.H have been released, the only ones detained being "" those caught red-handed in collusion and complicity with enemies organising the invasion of the national territory "".
.The Government goes on to state that no action has as yet been taken under the order (mentioned in paragraph  above) made on  January  by the examining magistrate "" because under the fundamental laws the accused are judged each in turn by the criminal assizes held every year under an order of the senior judge of the civil court "". The Government adds that "" if the accused are not discharged as an act of mercy before the court's verdict, the Secretariat of State will have pleasure in sending you, by way of complementary information, a copy of the text of the judgment as soon as it has been pronounced "".
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the information provided by the Government, to request the latter to be good enough to let the Governing Body know whether the persons mentioned by the complainants have or have not been discharged as an act of mercy and, if not, to communicate the text of the judgment or judgments delivered, with the text of the grounds therefor.
.This case already came before the Committee at its th and th Sessions, in November  and February  respectively. The case consisted of two sets of allegations: one relating to the dissolution of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti and the other to the arrest of trade union leaders and militants. The Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body with regard to the first set of allegations in paragraphs  to  and  (a) of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). With respect to the second set of allegations the Committee felt it necessary at both the November  Session and the February  Session to seek further information from the Government before submitting its final recommendations to the Governing Body, and made a recommendation to this effect to the Governing Body, which approved it. The paragraphs which follow deal only with the allegations which remain outstanding.
.The complainants allege that, parallel with the action taken to dissolve the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti (U.I.H.), the Government arranged for the arbitrary arrest of a number of trade union leaders and militants. The persons arrested included Mr. Ulrick Joly, President of U.I.H, Messrs. Claude Franois and Lon Gabriel, members of the Executive Committee of the said organisation and presidents of the cement and sugar workers' unions, respectively, Messrs. Alcius Cadet and Arnold Maisoneuve, of the boat-breakers' union, and, lastly, union officials Messrs. Prossoir and Guerrior.
.In its observations the Government stated that the inquiry carried out by the Haitian police into the activities of these persons had shown that for some time past they had been engaging in subversive activities with a view to overthrowing the Constitutionally established rgime. To be more precise, these persons, militants of U.I.H, acting on orders from political groups abroad, were waging what was clearly a terrorist campaign, including the organisation of acts of aggression against representatives of the State, as, for instance, at Fort-Libert, where the local civil authorities narrowly escaped an ambush prepared by the leaders of U.I.H.
.When it examined the case at its November  Session the Committee observed that it was quite clear from the observations submitted by the Government and from the text of the judgment ordering the suspension of the activities of U.I.H, which was appended to the Government's observations, that that organisation, as such, had been engaging in activities exceeding the bounds of normal trade union activities. At its session of February  the Committee considered, in the light of the additional explanations furnished by the Government, that the leaders of the organisation whose activities have been suspended, seemed to have been guilty, as individuals, of illegal acts of a political and not a trade union nature.
.Noting, however, that, while it mentioned a police inquiry in its observations, the Government did not specify whether the action taken against the persons concerned had been the outcome of court proceedings or not, the Committee, recalling the importance it has always attached to the observance of adequate judicial safeguards in cases where trade unionists are accused of political offences or unlawful acts, including the right of all detained persons to receive",-1,1964,Haiti
32,"a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, considered that before it could submit its final recommendations on the case it needed to know whether the action taken against the persons named by the World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) was in implementation of a sentence and, if so, by what authority sentence was pronounced.,
.The Committee consequently recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be so good as to furnish it with the additional information indicated above, and this recommendation was approved by the Governing Body. This request was made to the Government by a letter dated  March , and the Government replied by a communication dated  March .
.The Government's reply consists of an extract from the records of the Registry Civil Court in Port-au-Prince, according to which, since the investigation into the activities of the persons named by W.F.T.U had shown that there were "" sufficient charges and evidence against them "", the examining magistrate decided, on  January , "" to remand the accused to the court of competent jurisdiction "".
.In the past the Committee has always followed the practice of not proceeding to examine matters which were the subject of pending national judicial proceedings offering all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure, which seems to be the case in the present instance, where such proceedings might make available information of assistance to the Committee in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded. In many cases, moreover, the Committee has asked governments to communicate the texts of the judgments given and the grounds therefor.
.Accordingly, in conformity with its normal practice, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to communicate the text of the judgment relating to the persons in question, when it has been given, together with the grounds therefor, and meanwhile to postpone examination of the case.
.This case already came before the Committee at its th Session in November . The case consisted of two sets of allegations: one relating to the dissolution of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti (U.I.H.) and the other referring to the arrest of trade union leaders and officials. The Committee submitted its final conclusions to the Governing Body in regard to the first set of allegations in paragraphs  to  and  (a) of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). With respect to the second set of allegations the Committee felt it necessary to seek further information from the Government before submitting its final conclusions to the Governing Body, and made a recommendation to this effect to the Governing Body, which approved it. The paragraphs which follow deal only with the matters which remain outstanding.
.The complainants allege that, parallel with the action taken to dissolve U.I.H, the Government arranged for the arbitrary arrest of a number of trade union leaders and officials. The persons arrested included Mr. Ulrick Joly, President of the Federation, Messrs. Claude Franois and Lon Gabriel, members of the Executive Committee and presidents, respectively, of the cement and sugar workers' unions, Messrs. Alcius Cadet and Arnold Maisoneuve, of the boat-breakers' union, and the union officials Messrs. Prossoir and Guerrior.
.Noting that in the various communications it had addressed to the I.L.O the Government had failed to furnish any observations on this aspect of the case, and bearing in mind the fact that specific allegations of a rather serious character had been made, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations in this connection)
.This request was conveyed to the Government by a letter from the Director-General dated  November , to which the Government replied by a communication dated  December .
.In its reply the Government states that the inquiry carried out by the Haitian police into the activities of the persons named by the World Federation of Trade Unions has shown that for some time past they had been engaging in subversive activities with a view to overthrowing the Constitutionally established rgime. To be more precise, these persons, officials of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti, acting on orders from political groups abroad, were waging a terrorist campaign characterised in the main by acts of aggression against representatives of the State, as for instance at Fort - Libert, where the local civil authorities narrowly escaped an ambush prepared for them by the leaders of U.I.H.
.When it examined the case at its November  session the Committee observed that it was quite clear from the explanations furnished by the Government, as well as from the text of the judgment ordering the suspension of the activities of U.I.H appended to the Government's observations, that that organisation had been engaging in political activities outside the framework of normal trade union activities. It now appears from the explanations furnished by the Government in its communication of  December  that the leaders of the organisation whose activities have been suspended are individually guilty of illegal acts of a political and not a trade union nature.
.However, while it mentions a police inquiry in its reply, the Government does not specify whether the action taken against these persons was the outcome of court proceedings or not.
.In view of the importance which the Committee has always attached to the observance of adequate judicial safeguards in cases where trade unionists are accused of political offences or unlawful acts-including the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment -the Committee considers that, before it can submit its final conclusions on the case, it needs to know whether the action taken against the persons named by W.F.T.U was in implementation of a sentence, and if so, by what authority sentence was pronounced.
.It therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the additional information indicated above, and pending receipt thereof to postpone examination of the case.
.A first complaint relating to the incidents alleged to have occurred in this case was submitted to the I.L.O on  January  by the Committee for Trade Union Co-ordination of Workers of Latin America. The Committee on Freedom of Association examined this complaint at its th Session held in Geneva in June  and found it irreceivable because it emanated from an international organisation of workers not having consultative status with the I.L.O and not having affiliates in the country concerned; it therefore was not communicated to the Government concerned.
.However, the Government of its own accord forwarded to the I.L.O, by a communication dated  January , a comprehensive collection of documents relating to the situation in respect of which the allegations were made by the above-mentioned organisation.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) in turn submitted a complaint on the same subject, by a communication dated  April . As this complaint emanated from an international organisation of workers having consultative status with the I.L.O and was therefore receivable, it was communicated on  May  to the Government for observations so as to comply with the procedural requirements, even though observations had already been furnished by the Government, as it were, in advance.
.The Government submitted a new lot of observations by a communication dated  June .
.In the following paragraphs consideration will be given, on the one hand, to the allegations contained in the complaint of the W.F.T.U, the only one to be receivable, and, on the other hand, to the observations contained in the communications of the Government dated  January and  June  respectively.
.Haiti has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, that the allegations relating to the dissolution of the Inter-Union Federation of Haiti do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations relating to the arrest of the trade union leaders and officials mentioned by name in the complaint of the W.F.T.U dated  April ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the supplementary information referred to in subparagraph (b) above.",-1,1964,Haiti
33,".By a communication dated  November  addressed directly to the I.L.O, the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions presented a complaint of alleged infringements of freedom of association against the Government of the Republic of Haiti.
.As this complaint alleges that a person was arrested, it was dealt with in accordance with the urgency procedure established in respect of such cases by a decision of the Governing Body in November  (th Session).
.In accordance with that procedure, the Director-General, by a letter dated  November , brought the text of the complaint to the notice of the Government, requesting the Government to forward its observations thereon as a matter of urgency.
.The Government of Haiti replied by a communication dated  December .
.In the meantime, the complaining organisation addressed to the Director-General a letter dated  December , by which it implicitly withdraws the complaint.
.In its original communication dated  November , the I.F.C.T.U alleged that Mr. Lonville Leblanc, President of the Federation of Christian Workers of Haiti and a participant at the I.F.C.T.UJI.L.O. Seminar in Quito, had been arrested when he returned to Port-au-Prince. In a later communication dated  December , the complainants, while maintaining reservations as to the restrictions stated to be imposed on trade unions in Haiti, declare that they have had news of the liberation of Mr. Leblanc and indicate that, as the facts complained of no longer subsist, their complaint has now become purposeless.
.The questions raised by the withdrawal of a complaint have been examined in earlier cases by the Committee. In Case No.  relating to Greece, the Committee expressed the view that the desire shown by a complaining organisation to withdraw its complaint, while constituting a factor to which the greatest attention must be paid, is not, however, in itself sufficient reason for the Committee to cease automatically to proceed with the examination of the complaint. The Committee considered in that case, having regard to conclusions adopted earlier by the Governing Body, that it is free to evaluate the reasons given to explain the withdrawal of a complaint and to investigate whether these appear sufficiently plausible to lead one to believe that the withdrawal was made in complete independence. The Committee observed that cases might exist in which the withdrawal of a complaint by the organisation presenting it would be a result not of the fact that the complaint had become without purpose but of pressure exercised by the government against the complainants, the latter being threatened with an aggravation of the situation if they did not consent to this withdrawal.
.In the present case, the reason given by the complainants for their desire that the Committee should not examine the complaint further is that the person who was arrested has since been liberated. It would seem therefore that the grievances which gave rise to the complaint no longer subsist.
.This fact is corroborated by the statements of the Government, which declares, in its reply dated  December , that Mr. Leblanc was arrested not by reason of his trade union activities but on suspicion of having, in contravention of the law of Haiti, transported private letters emanating from abroad. When the investigation revealed, however, that there were no grounds for this suspicion, the person concerned was immediately liberated.
.In these circumstances, having regard to the statements both of the complainants and of the Government, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that there is no ground for pursuing the matter further.",-1,1959,Haiti
34,".The complaint of the I.C.F.T.U was submitted to the I.L.O on  July  and was transmitted to the Government of Haiti by a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations to the Office by a communication dated  September .
.When it examined the case at its th Session (November ), the Committee took the view that it would be necessary to obtain further information from both the complaining organisation and the Government before it could make its recommendations to the Governing Body. The Committee decided, therefore, to adjourn its examination of the case until the information in question had been received.
.Having been informed of this decision, the Government of Haiti and the I.C.F.T.U forwarded the further information requested of them by two letters dated  and  January  respectively. In a letter dated  February  the Government forwarded its comments on the supplementary information contained in the I.C.F.T.U's communication dated  January , which had been transmitted to the Government by the Director-General.
.When it examined the case further at its st Session (February ), the Committee was able to make final recommendations to the Governing Body on all except one aspect of the allegations. These recommendations, and the reasoning on which they were based, are contained in the rd Report. With respect to the allegations with which it did not feel that it could deal finally at that time, the Committee made an interim report, considering it necessary to obtain additional information from the Government before formulating its final conclusions.
.This request for further information was conveyed by the Director-General to the Government, which forwarded a reply to the Office on  April .
.At its nd Session (May ) the Committee adjourned its examination of the case until its next session, in accordance with a request made by the I.C.F.T.U by a telegram dated  May , in which it stated that further information was being forwarded.
.The further information referred to by the complainant was forwarded to the Office by a communication dated  August  and was transmitted to the Government of Haiti for its observations by a letter dated  September .
.The Government replied by a letter dated  October ; this reply having been received by the Office too late to permit of its being examined by the Committee at its rd Session (November ), the examination was adjourned until the th Session of the Committee.
.At its th Session (February ) the Committee considered it necessary to ask the Government to clarify certain aspects of the matter and adjourned its examination of the case pending the receipt of the information in question. The Government was requested to furnish this information by a letter from the Director-General dated  March .
.At its th Session (May ) the Committee, not having received the further information requested from the Government, adjourned its examination of the case until its present session.
.The information requested was forwarded to the Office by the Government of Haiti by a letter dated  June .
.Having regard to the explanations given in paragraph  above, the present document relates only to the one set of allegations still outstanding.Allegations relating to Measures Taken against Mr. Nathanael Michel, General Secretary of the National Union of Workers of Haiti (U.N.O.H)
.In its original complaint, the I.C.F.T.U alleges that, on  January , Mr. Nathanael Michel, General Secretary of the U.N.O.H, was arrested and kept in prison without any charges having been brought against him. After being released from prison on  January , Mr. Michel was assigned a forced residence for several weeks. Moreover, it is stated, Mr. Michel was removed from his post as a teacher at the Haiti Central School of Arts and Crafts.
.Although they do not make a specific statement to this effect, the complainants, in their communication dated  July , allow it to be understood that these measures originated in the trade union activities of Mr. Michel, and they consider in particular that the removal from office of the person concerned constitutes a contravention of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Haiti, Article  of which provides that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker because of his participation in union activities.
.In its first reply dated  September  the Government affirms that Mr. Michel was never disturbed on account of his trade union activities and that the measures taken against him originated in his political activities, while he had also been guilty of embezzlement. In support of its claim that the measures taken against Mr. Michel were not connected with his trade union activities, the Government annexes to its reply a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Michel by the new President of the U.N.O.H. In this letter it is stated "" for reasons of a purely political character you were arrested on  January of this year and set free after  days of imprisonment but kept under police supervision. Since this last police measure was cancelled for you and for others, through the intervention of the U.N.O.H and of certain national and international democratic organisations, you have stayed underground for personal reasons "" and, further on: "" The members of the Committee of the U.N.O.H are prepared to help you in any action you may take to clear yourself of the charge of communism which has recently been laid at your door.""
.In several earlier cases the Committee has been called upon to formulate conclusions on the application of measures which, even though of a political character and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, may nevertheless affect the exercise of such rights. When it examined the present case in November  the Committee took the view that, as the person concerned had trade union responsibilities, the measure taken with regard to him was likely, even if that were not intended, to affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee pointed out that, if in certain previous cases it has reached the conclusion that allegations relating to measures taken against trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In the present case the Committee noted that the Government did not give details of the activities which caused measures to be taken against the person concerned. In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the measures in question were taken at a moment when trade union elections were being held in the organisation of which Mr. Michel was general secretary, the Committee considered that, in order to be able to reach a conclusion in full knowledge of all the circumstances, it should request the Government to furnish more detailed information with respect both to the specific reasons for the measures complained of being taken and, in particular, to the particular activities which had been held against him.
.Further, in view of the complainants' allegation that Mr. Michel was arrested and kept in custody without any specific charges having been made against him, and of the fact that the Government, in its reply dated  September , made no observations on this particular aspect of the case, the Committee, having regard to the importance which it has always attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences, decided, in November , to request the Government to be good enough to furnish information concerning the procedure followed when the measures against Mr. Michel were taken and concerning the guarantees attending such procedure.
.In response to these requests for information the Government, in a communication dated  January , began by confirming the statements made in its previous observations, forwarded on  September . It pointed out further that the U.N.O.H, an affiliate of the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (O.R.I.T) and the organisation to which Mr. Michel belonged, took part in the O.R.I.T - I.C.F.T.U Conference in Bogot in December , its delegate being Mr. Fritzner Sainvil, now general secretary of the U.N.O.H in succession to Mr. Michel. This delegate, freely chosen, according to the Government, by the organisation in question, was duly accredited and participated in the normal way in the work of the Conference. Yet, declares the Government, it is precisely the I.C.F.T.U which has submitted a complaint concerning Mr. Michel to the I.L.O.
.Referring more specifically to the particular points raised by the Committee, the Government, in further observations dated  January , declared that the measures taken against Mr. Michel were taken pursuant to legal provisions adopted because of the abnormal political situation prevailing in",-1,1958,Haiti
35,"Haiti. These legal provisions, a copy of which was annexed to the Government's communication of  January , are the following:(a) Order of the Military Council of the Government dated  September  proclaiming a state of martial law throughout the territory of the Republic;(b) Order of the President of the Republic dated  May  declaring a state of siege throughout the territory of the Republic and suspending the guarantees prescribed by articles , , , , ,  and  of the Constitution;(c) Decree of the Legislative Body dated  July  suspending the guarantees prescribed by articles , , ,  (paragraph ), ,  and  of the Constitution and according full powers to the Head of the Executive for a period of six months.The Government also annexed to its reply the text of the Constitutional guarantees contained in the articles of the national Constitution mentioned in the orders and decree cited above..When it examined the case at its st Session (February ), the Committee observed that it was clear from the texts cited by the Government that the reasons which caused them to be put into application must be sought in the disturbed political situation experienced in Haiti.
.When it examined the case at its st Session (February ), the Committee observed that it was clear from the texts cited by the Government that the reasons which caused them to be put into application must be sought in the disturbed political situation experienced in Haiti.
.The Committee recalled that in many previous cases in which it had had to examine allegations against countries which were in a state of political crisis or had just passed through grave disturbances (civil war, revolution, etc.), it had considered it necessary, when examining the various measures taken by the governments, including some against trade union organisations, to have regard to such exceptional circumstances when examining the merits of the allegations. However, in cases in which it has had before it complaints of alleged infringements of freedom of association under a state of siege or emergency or by virtue of national security legislation, the Committee, while indicating that it is not called upon to comment on the necessity for or desirability of such legislation, which is a purely political consideration, has always taken the view that it must consider what repercussions the legislation might have on trade union rights.
.While refraining, therefore, from commenting on the political aspects of the state of emergency pursuant to which the measures complained of had been taken against Mr. Michel, the Committee, in February , nevertheless affirmed once again the importance which it attaches to the principle that measures of detention should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and to the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and recommended the Governing Body to draw these points to the attention of the Government of Haiti.
.With regard to the particular case of Mr. Michel and to the measures taken against him, the Committee, at its February  Session, observed that, while the Government referred to the legal texts and to the procedures pursuant to which the measures were taken, it nevertheless made no mention of the reasons that caused them to be taken. For these reasons the Committee asked the Director-General to obtain further information from the Government on this point.
.Responding to that request for further information by a communication dated  April , the Government, in order to show that the reasons for the measures taken against the person concerned were completely unconnected with his trade union functions or activities, furnishes a copy of a confidential letter addressed to the Secretary of State for Labour, on  October , by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and National Defence, in which it is stated: "" Mr. Nathanael Michel, former general secretary of the National Union of Workers of Haiti, was removed from his post by the members of that organisation because he had pawned a cin-camera, a duplicating machine and other articles belonging to that organisation in a pawnshop belonging to Mr. Appolon Thzine. Being trade union property, these articles could not be disposed of or mortgaged except under certain specific conditions prescribed by legislation. Mr. Michel took no heed of this fact. Secondly, he was removed from his post by the General Assembly of the U.N.O.H. Being enraged, he tried to ascribe his dismissal to political causes and made all sorts of efforts to break up the organisation. In order to avoid the possibility that any dangerous action by this swindler should imperil the continued existence of this trade union organisation, Mr. Michel was assigned a forced residence in Gressier.""
.This accusation made against Mr. Michel by the U.N.O.H was, the Government affirms, the only reason for the action taken against him by the government police services. The Government adds that because of his constant political activities directed against the Government, "" which were partly responsible for the repressive action taken against him "", Mr. Michel thought it desirable to seek sanctuary in the Embassy of Venezuela and then, subsequently, went to Venezuela.
.At its nd Session (May ) the Committee, taking account of a telegram dated  May  from the I.C.F.T.U informing it of the despatch of further information and requesting, accordingly, an adjournment, decided to adjourn its examination of the case to a later session. The further information referred to by the complainants is contained in a communication dated  August .
.In this communication the complainants seek to furnish information on a number of points which, they state, has been forwarded to them by Mr. Michel himself from the United States where he would appear to have gone after a brief stay in Venezuela.
.According to the information received by the complainants, after the dissolution of a number of occupational associations ordered following the change of rgime in June , the U.N.O.H waged a campaign of protest which resulted in Messrs. Isidore and Michel, respectively president and general secretary of the U.N.O.H, being summoned to the Dessalines Barracks, where threats were made that they would be tortured and the headquarters of the U.N.O.H would be closed if the protest campaign waged by that organisation was not terminated.
.In the observations made by the Government in a communication dated  October  in respect of the further information furnished on  August  by the I.C.F.T.U, the Government formally denies that, following the change in the Presidency of the Republic, any massive dissolutions of trade unions took place and challenges the complainants to furnish a list of the organisations claimed to have been dissolved. The Government also affirms that Messrs. Isidore and Michel were never summoned to the Dessalines Barracks to be threatened with torture on account of the trade union affairs of the U.N.O.H and, in support of its statement in this connection, it adduces the text of a declaration made by Mr. Isidore, indicating that neither he nor Mr. Michel was summoned to the Dessalines Barracks, and that no pressure was exercised by the authorities in respect of the trade union affairs of the U.N.O.H.
.The complainants again having mentioned the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Michel, the Government refers to its earlier communications in respect of the reasons which occasioned these measures.
.The complainants also recall that Mr. Michel was dismissed from his post as a teacher at the Haiti Central School of Arts and Crafts "" under the pretext that he had resigned in accordance with the regulations of that Department "". In this connection the Government forwards the text of a letter from the National Department of Education which gives the reasons for the removal of Mr. Michel from his post as a teacher in the Central School of Arts and Crafts, the summary of these reasons being that the person concerned stayed away from his work without having obtained authorisation to do so, thus rendering himself liable to the application of the disciplinary provisions of the National Education Regulations (section ), according to which prolonged absence without reason and without prior authorisation may entail dismissal.
.The complainants then allege that the reason for which Mr. Michel, after being released, was placed in forced residence resulted from his refusal of the proposals made by the Government that he should resign from the U.N.O.H. The I.C.F.T.U also alleges that, in April , the Secretary of State for Labour convened separately the leaders of the organisations affiliated to the U.N.O.H in order to ask them to give their aid to the Government by disavowing the Executive Committee of the organisation.
.In its reply dated  October  the Government denies that it asked Mr. Michel to resign from his post as general secretary of the U.N.O.H and declares, on the contrary, that it has always refrained from intervening in the administration of occupational associations. It also denies ever having convened the leaders of the trade union organisations affiliated to the U.N.O.H in order to ask",-1,1958,Haiti
36,"them to give their aid to the Government by disavowing the Executive Committee of the organisation.
."" Under the Government's threat to close down the Union's offices"" continue the complainants "" the Management Committee had unanimously decided to place the audiovisual apparatus belonging to the U.N.O.H in safe keeping lest it be destroyed or confiscated by the authorities. Accordingly, an electric generator and a Delco, together with the necessary papers, were entrusted to a business firm, the understanding being that when the U.N.O.H took the equipment back it would pay a sum of $ to the owner of the firm. Mr. Michel was subsequently accused of fraudulent conversion and false pretences at the U.N.O.H's expense but in fact it is clear that he was only carrying out the instructions of the U.N.O.H committee without deriving any personal advantage from so doing.""
.In opposition to this interpretation of the facts, the Government gives an entirely different version, supported by various pieces of evidence emanating respectively from the U.N.O.H and from Mr. Thzine, owner of the "" business house "". In the first place it would appear from these documents that in Haiti the expression "" business house "" means the office of a person who lends on security. It would also appear from a memorandum drawn up by the U.N.O.H that Mr. Michel wrongfully used the apparatus belonging to a trade union in order to secure a personal loan and that, moreover, he retained a number of other objects belonging to the organisation. In this connection, the memorandum of the U.N.O.H con-tained the following statement: "" By pledging a projector and a duplicating machine belonging to the U.N.O.H, Mr. Nathanael Michel acted arbitrarily and without the knowledge of the other members of the Management Committee of the union. It was a personal action from which he alone derived benefit."" It would also appear from the letter from the pawnbroker, Mr. Thzine, that the latter attempted, by laying a complaint before the police, to have Mr. Michel arrested for fraud and misuse of funds because, in the words of Mr. Thzine, as he was not the owner of the apparatus in question, he did not have the right to pledge it. But at that time, adds Mr. Thzine, Mr. Michel "" had already gone underground "".
.When it considered the case at its th Session (February ), the Committee took the view that further clarification on certain points would be necessary before it could make its final recommendations to the Governing Body.
.Thus, the Committee observed that, according to the Government's communication dated  October , Mr. Michel appeared to have been dismissed on the ground that he had absented himself, without leave, from his work at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where he was a teacher. But, observed the Committee, it appeared from the other information in its possession that Mr. Michel was in prison at the time of such dismissal.
.The Committee also noted that, in its observations, the Government declared that the offences committed by Mr. Michel were the only reason, or at least the essential reason, for the measures taken against him, and, therefore, the Committee could not understand why, that being the case, those measures were taken pursuant to an exceptional procedure and not under the common law penal procedure.
.By a letter dated  March  the Director-General, on behalf of the Committee, requested the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the two points mentioned above. The Government replied by a communication dated  June .
.With regard to the first point, the Government refers to section  of the Act of  September , which reads as follows:
.The detention of an employee in custody for not more than  days followed by acquittal shall likewise be a case of suspension of the contract without liability for the employer or employee.The employee shall, within three days of the date on which detention commenced, inform the employer of the reason why he is unable to report for work, and shall return to work within the two days of the date on which the circumstance ceases to exist; if he fails to do so, the contract shall be deemed to be terminated without liability for either side. If so requested by the employee, the director of the prison shall issue the necessary certificates in evidence of the facts mentioned in this article.The Government declares that Mr. Michel, contrary to this section of the Act, did not inform his chief of his imprisonment, which is why the General Directorate of National Education applied the disciplinary measure prescribed by section  of the Act of  September .
.It would appear from the explanations given by the Government that Mr. Michel failed to comply with the legal requirements in that he did not furnish information to his superior indicating the reasons for his absence from work and that, thereupon, the General Directorate of National Education considered itself justified in applying the provisions of the Act, which stipulate the termination of the contract where such information is not furnished.
.With respect to the second point raised by the Committee, the Government refers in the first place to its earlier statements and seeks to justify the application of an exceptional procedure in the case of Mr. Michel on the ground that, apart from the other offences committed by him, he was guilty of anti-government political activities of a reprehensible character.
.Although the explanations given by the Government--including those set forth in paragraphs  and  above-still remain obscure to a certain extent, it would nevertheless appear to be fairly clear from these explanations and from the documents furnished in support thereof that the reasons for the measures taken against Mr. Michel had their origin in political considerations and, also, in common law offences stated to have been committed by Mr. Michel. However this may be, it would not seem to be established that the measures complained against resulted from his trade union activities.
.In earlier cases in which the Committee has had to examine allegations relating to the prosecution of trade union officials and active trade unionists, it considered that the only question to be answered was the real reason for the arrests or trials. Only if these were ordered by reason of the trade union activities properly so called of the arrested persons had a violation of freedom of association occurred.
.Moreover, the Committee observes that the complainants base their latest further information solely on statements by Mr. Michel (see paragraph  above). The Committee considers that, although the question of proof must be judged in each case according to the particular circumstances, a complaint which is based solely on statements by the person directly concerned is, especially in particular equivocal circumstances such as those subsisting in the present case, necessarily somewhat suspect and could not be regarded as substantiated by adequate evidence.
.In these circumstances, while regretting even if it be true that the measures taken against Mr. Michel were mainly occasioned by common law offences stated to have been committed by the person concerned-that the ordinary penal procedure was not utilised in his case in preference to an exceptional procedure, and emphasising once again the importance which it attaches to the fact that measures of detention should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and to the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, the Committee considers that the complainants-whose allegations in this case are based solely on the statements of the person accused-have not furnished proof that the measures complained against constituted, in this instance, an infringement of freedom of association. The Committee, therefore, recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to the observations made above, that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint dated  July  was addressed directly to the I.L.O by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The complaining organisation was informed, by a letter dated  August , of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint within a period of one month.
.The complaint was transmitted to the Government of Haiti by a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations to the Office by a communication dated  September .
.When it examined the case at its th Session (Geneva, November ), the Committee took the view that it would be necessary to obtain further information from both the complaining organisation and the Government before it could make its recommendations to the Governing Body. The Committee decided, therefore, to adjourn its examination of the case until the information in question had been received.
.Having been informed of this decision the Government of Haiti and the I.C.F.T.U forwarded the further information requested of them by two letters dated  and  January  respectively. In a letter dated  February , the Government forwarded its comments on the supplementary information contained in the I.C.F.T.U's communication dated  January , which had been",-1,1958,Haiti

.Haiti has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs -, - and - above respectively, that the allegations relating to measures taken against Mr. Lyderic Bonaventure, to interference by the Government in trade union elections and to the arrest of the trade union leaders who went to welcome the representative of the I.C.F.T.U do not call for further examination ;(b) to decide, while drawing the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle that national organisations of workers should have the right freely to maintain contact with the international organisations of workers to which they are affiliated, that, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs - above, the allegations relating to violations of trade union freedom in the international sphere do not call for further examination ;(c) to reaffirm, while refraining from commenting on the political aspects of the emergency measures at present in force in Haiti, the importance which it attaches to the principle that measures of detention should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and to the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial, attended by all the guarantees of due process of law, at the earliest possible moment ;(d) to take note of the present interim report with respect to allegations relating to measures taken against Mr. Nathanael Michel, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the further information requested from the Government.Geneva,  March .
