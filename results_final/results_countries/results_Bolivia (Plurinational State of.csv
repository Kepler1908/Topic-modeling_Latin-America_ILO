0,".The complaint is contained in communications dated  July and  November  of the Departmental Federation of Oil Workers of Santa Cruz (FDTPSC).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).A. The complainants' allegations
.In its communications dated  July and  November , the FDTPSC indicates that it was founded on  July  by the following trade unions: the YPFB Transporte Oil Workers' Union (Trade Union I); the YPFB Andina Oil Workers' Union (Trade Union II); the Petrobras Bolivia Oil Workers' Union (Trade Union III); the Eastern Oil Workers' Union (Trade Union IV); and the Union of Oil Workers of YPFB Refinacin Gualberto Villaroel (Trade Union V). The complainant organization indicates that the FDTPSC was established as a result of the abandonment and lack of protection of the aforementioned trade unions by the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, which is affiliated with the Bolivian Workers' Federation (COB), and particularly as a result of its financial mismanagement. It also indicates that, after the establishment of the FDTPSC, the five trade unions made the joint decision to withdraw from the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia.
.The complainant organization indicates that: (i) on  August , in compliance with the national legislation in force, in particular with Ministerial Decision No. /, which establishes the requirements and procedures for granting recognition of the leadership of trade union organizations, the FDTPSC requested the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare (MTEPS) to recognize its leadership and the union leave entitlement of the members of the executive committee; and (ii) on  October , the MTEPS issued Decision No. / recognizing the leadership and union leave entitlement of the FDTPSC. The complainant organization has attached a copy of Decision No. / which indicates that the General Directorate for Trade Union Affairs concluded that the procedure to recognize the leadership and union leave entitlement of the FDTPSC for the period '  was technically sound, as it complied with the requirements and procedures approved by Ministerial Resolution No. /.
.According to the complainant organization, on  November , the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia filed an appeal to revoke Decision No. /. The complainant organization considers that the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia lacked a legitimate interest for filing the appeal for revocation, and that only the applicant, that is, the FDTPSC, could challenge the ministerial decision concerning it. The complainant organization alleges that the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia wanted to avoid recognizing the leadership and union leave entitlement of the executive committee of the FDTPSC in order to harm the trade unions belonging to the FDTPSC and to force them to rejoin the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia. The complainant organization alleges that all of this is in clear violation of its rights and guarantees, and aims to legitimize an alleged trade union dictatorship, circumvented by the MTEPS, which should protect the interests of workers, but is instead violating these interests, by giving preference to a group of leaders. The complainant organization states that, owing to the appeal for revocation filed by the Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, on  November , following the change in Government, the new authorities of the MTEPS issued Decision No. /, which illegally revokes Decision No. / in its entirety. It also indicates that, on  November , the FDTPSC filed a hierarchical appeal against Decision No. /, and that, on  December , it requested the MTEPS to suspend the enforcement of the contested Decision.
.The complainant organization also states that, on  January , the executive committee of the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, once again making use of its influence, requested the MTEPS to annul the ministerial decisions issued under the transitional Government regarding the trade unions that belong to and founded the FDTPSC, indicating that,  At the national conference of general secretaries of the country, held in La Paz on  November , during which Decisions Nos / and / were issued, the national conference, after holding a comprehensive discussion in the exercise of its attributions and powers, unanimously decided that the trade union leaders who had allegedly participated in reprehensible acts of division and parallelism be expelled with ignominy from the national movement, and that their union leave entitlement be immediately suspended, for having permanently withdrawn from their parent organization, thus annulling the decisions ensuing from the unorganized actions of the coup d at by the de facto Government. Consequently, the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia revokes the corresponding approval'  The complainant organization indicates that, as a result, on  February , the MTEPS issued Decision No. / which revoked, in their entirety, the ministerial decisions relating to the five trade unions that belong to and founded the FDTPSC. It also indicates that: (i) on  February , the FDTPSC filed an appeal for revocation, seeking the annulment of Decision No. / vitiated by nullity and which violated acquired rights in breach of legal certainty as part of due process; (ii) on  February , the Minister of Labour was requested to suspend the enforcement of Decision No. /; and (iii) due to administrative silence, on  March , the FDTPSC lodged an appeal for amparo [protection of constitutional rights] requesting the suspension of the enforcement of Decision No. /, guaranteeing the rights to petition and to organize enshrined in the Political Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia (CPE) and ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The complainant organization indicates that, since the revocation of the ministerial and administrative decisions concerning the five trade union organizations, the organizations have been going through a very difficult period. It indicates that the leaders of the five trade union organizations are being persecuted and harassed and, in some cases, have been dismissed illegally, despite being protected by trade union immunity as trade union leaders, as part of a plan to destabilize and leave workers defenceless. The complainant organization has attached documents which refer to the dismissal of members of Trade Unions I and II, and which indicate that Mr Dimar Cspedes Zardn and Mr Freddy Vsquez Moreno, who had been leaders of Trade Union I until  February , were reportedly dismissed on  July , without a judicial process and in violation of section  of the CPE, which establishes that trade union leaders shall enjoy trade union immunity and that they shall not be dismissed until one year after the end of their mandate.
.The complainant organization also alleges that the MTEPS has taken on the political task of preventing or obstructing the operation of the trade unions belonging to the FDTPSC and has illegally recognized the leadership of parallel trade unions. The complainant organization has attached documents indicating that, by means of Decision No. /, the MTEPS rejected an appeal for revocation filed by the former leader of Trade Union IV, Mr Ronald Medrano Heredia, who contested a decision recognizing a fake Eastern oil workers' trade union approved by the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia.
.The complainant organization further alleges that criminal proceedings have been initiated against leaders of Trade Union I for alleged offences of conduct jeopardizing economic development, misuse of influence, dereliction of duty and illegitimate contributions and benefits. The complainant organization alleges that, despite having filed complaints and administrative appeals against the dismissals and against transfers, the complaints lodged before the MTEPS were not addressed.B. The Government s replies
.In its communication of  May , the Government indicates that section  of the CPE of  February , recognizes the right of all workers to organize themselves in trade unions, and establishes that the State shall respect the ideological and organizational independence of trade unions, which shall enjoy legal personality solely by virtue of the fact that they organize and are recognized by their parent entities. The Government also indicates that section  of the General Labour Act regulates employers' and workers' organizations, and provides that the right to form unions, which may be employers' organizations, trade unions or professional associations, whether mixed, industrial or at enterprise level, is recognized, and that, in order to act as such, a trade union must be permanent in nature, have a legal personality and be established in accordance with the legal rules. It indicates that section  is in line with the Regulatory Decree of the General Labour Act, which recognizes the right of workers to form unions.Acts of recognition and revocation concerning the FDTPSC
.The Government indicates that: (i) on  August , members of the FDTPSC requested the MTEPS to recognize the leadership and union leave entitlement of the executive committee, and attached documentation in compliance with the requirements established",-1,2021,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
1,"by Decision No. /, which provides that it is necessary to, inter alia, submit the approval or certification document issued by the parent entity, specifying the type of procedure being approved; (ii) after the documents submitted by the FDTPSC had been analysed, the Directorate of Trade Union Affairs considered that the procedure to recognize the leadership and union leave entitlement was  technically sound'  (iii) while the General Directorate of Legal Affairs of the MTEPS made some observations in relation to the documents submitted, including that there was no register of members in order to identify the FDTPSC as a federation, in reports dated  and  October , the General Directorate of Legal Affairs of the MTEPS indicated that the observations had been addressed, and recommended that the relevant decision be issued; and (iv) on  October , the MTEPS issued Decision No. /, which recognized the leadership of the FDTPSC for the period from  July  to  July , and which declared ten leaders of the FDTPSC as being on union leave.
.The Government indicates that, on  November , the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, which belongs to the COB, filed an appeal for revocation that challenged Decision No. /, indicating that: (i) section  of the CPE provides that it is not sufficient for a trade union organization simply to organize, but that it also needs to be recognized/approved by a parent entity for its existence to be legally established, with the exception of the COB, as it is the highest parent entity; (ii) the recognition of leadership obtained by the FDTPSC did not comply with the main requirement of being recognized by its parent entity, and that, consequently, the MTEPS had issued a decision that failed to respect section  of the CPE, and Ministerial Decision No. /, which refers to approval or certification by a parent entity; and (iii) this demonstrated a lack of analysis and expertise on the part of the MTEP authorities, and that, the issuance of Decision No. / resulted in interference in the ideological and organizational independence of trade unions, which is prohibited by section .IV of the CPE; and as the supposed FDTPSC has not been approved by any parent entity in the trade union system, it is an entity on the fringes of the system, which has led to parallel and divisive actions within the trade union system, thus implicitly positioning the MTEPS as the parent entity.
.According to the documents attached by the Government, in issuing Decision No. /, the MTEPS expressed the principle of good faith, but this was in disregard of all the background information that was submitted with the appeal for revocation, which made it possible to conclude that the FDTPSC did not have the approval of the parent entity, that is, it failed to meet an essential requirement, and therefore, the of  November , which revokes Decision No. / of  October .Acts revoking the decisions concerning the five trade unions
.The Government indicates that, by means of decisions issued in ,  and , the Departmental Labour Office of Santa Cruz recognized the leadership of the five trade unions in question and that, in decisions issued by the MTEPS in those years, the leaders of the five trade union organizations were declared as being on union leave,  considering the justification and responsibility assumed by the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia' 
.According to the Government, on  January , the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, informed the MTEPS that the national conference of general secretaries of the country, held on  November , had issued Decisions Nos / and /, in which the national conference had unanimously decided that Mr Ronald Medrano Heredia, Mr Dimar Cspedes Zardn, Mr Jos Nogales Mrida, Mr Freddy Vsquez Moreno and Mr Jos Luis Franco Geiger be expelled with ignominy from the national movement and that their union leave entitlement be immediately suspended on the grounds of participation in reprehensible acts of division and parallelism, thus disqualifying them from exercising their trade union leadership (as leaders of the five trade unions and the FDTPSC). The Federation informed the MTEPS that the above-mentioned leaders had left the parent organization, and that, consequently, the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia had revoked the corresponding approval.
.The Government indicates that, in exercising its right to petition established in section  of the CPE and its right to challenge administrative decisions, the executive committee of the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia requested the MTEPS to annul the ministerial and administrative decisions concerning the five trade unions. The Government indicates that the MTEPS analysed the background information and documentation provided by the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, and that, on  February , it issued Decision No. / which revoked, in their entirety, the ministerial and administrative decisions recognizing the leadership and the union leave entitlement of the executive committees of the five trade unions. The Government indicates that the ministerial and administrative decisions recognizing the leadership and the union leave entitlement of the executive committees of the trade unions in question, owing to unforeseen circumstances not attributable to the administration, no longer complied with one of the requirements set out in Decision No. /, specifically the  approval or certification document issued by the parent entity, determining the type of procedure being approved'  which was indispensable for granting recognition of the leadership and/or union leave entitlement of the executive committees of the trade unions, and therefore it was appropriate to revoke the recognition of the leadership and the trade union leave entitlement of the leaders of the five trade unions.
.The Government indicates that those who had been the leaders of the five trade unions had filed an appeal for revocation against Decision No. / of  February . In this regard, the Government indicates that, as there is no evidence of a violation of acquired rights, as alleged by the applicants, and that, given that the administrative decision being challenged had only sought to safeguard the notion of public order, which is a criterion that applies to all decisions adopted by the public administration, it was concluded that Decision No. / of  February  did not restrict any rights of the members of the trade unions, and even less did it disregard the progressive nature of labour rights. The Government indicates that Decision No. / of  March  confirmed Decision No. / in its entirety.
.The Government indicates that Decisions Nos / and / were not issued arbitrarily, but rather in compliance with the procedure established in the Administrative Procedure Act, in particular, sections  and , which refer to the appeal for revocation and to the forms of settlement of legal challenges, and in response to a duly substantiated and express request submitted by the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia. The Government underscores that the State cannot intervene, as, if the State were to take measures such as suspending, by means of administrative proceedings, the status of trade union leaders (claim by the complainant organization), or challenging, overseeing or overruling the election processes of these leaders, it would mean disregarding the will expressed by workers through their workers' entities, undermining their autonomy in their functioning and administration, and unconstitutionally restricting their right to organize, which would therefore constitute a violation of section  of the CPE. The Government emphasizes that the above-mentioned decisions are subject to the principle of legality and the presumption of legitimacy, established in the Administrative Procedure Act, which determines that  the actions of the public administration, being fully subject to the law, are presumed to be lawful, unless expressly declared otherwise by the courts' 
.The Government indicates that the present complaint was filed by a person who was expelled from the trade union movement, and further states that the procedure established by the Administrative Procedure Act has not been exhausted, as, once a hierarchical appeal has been ruled upon, it is possible to file a judicial challenge by means of administrative dispute proceedings, before the Supreme Court of Justice. The Government indicates that the complainant organization should have appealed to the legal authority beforehand by means of administrative dispute proceedings.
.The Government also indicates that the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia is the parent entity that brings together all unionized state oil workers, and that it belongs to the COB, which is the parent entity for all workers in the country, making it the sole representative and participatory parent entity for workers' social demands. The Government indicates that the organization, representation and activities of these parent entities are based on the principles contained in the CPE, in particular those established in paragraph II of section , which states that  The State shall respect the principles of trade union unity ? which is one of the key principles of the trade",-1,2021,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
2,"union activity of trade union organizations in the country. Consequently, the intention to create a parallel trade union organization, to the detriment of the original lawfully organized trade union organization, constitutes a violation of the trade union principles established and recognized by the national legislation in force, and by the main parent entity for the workers in the country.
.With regard to the amparo appeal filed against Decision No. /, which reported alleged administrative silence and requested the suspension of the enforcement of the above-mentioned decision, the Government indicates that: (i) the MTEPS made an observation concerning the appeal, on the grounds that it was defective in form and substance and thus liable to cause error in the Constitutional Court; (ii) amparo appeals are not an alternative to or substitute for ordinary or administrative proceedings that the Constitution or law assign to the different jurisdictions for the protection of rights considered to be violated, but rather they are a subsidiary mechanism, as they can only be established when the injured party has no other means of defence; therefore, where other expedient remedies are available, these must be used first; (iii) in this case, the applicant failed to exhaust a further remedy provided for by the regulations governing administrative proceedings, specifically a hierarchical appeal, provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, which can be corroborated by the statements made by the complainant organization in reference to its appeal for revocation filed on  February ; (iv) the time frame for settling the appeal for revocation is  working days, and therefore the deadline for issuing the corresponding decision was  March , when Ministerial Decision No. / was issued, which confirmed Decision No. / in its entirety, and which was notified to the parties on  March , therefore demonstrating that no administrative silence occurred; and (v) in the event that the alleged negative administrative silence referred to in the amparo appeal had occurred, the applicant had the right to expeditiously challenge the decision by means of a hierarchical appeal, which was not exhausted.
.The Government indicates that, in the amparo appeal, the rights specified as having been violated were the right to petition and the right to form unions. Regarding the right to petition, it was claimed that there had been negative administrative silence, in that, allegedly, no response had been provided to the appeal for revocation filed on  February , which was not the case, as Decision No. / was issued on  March  in order to respond to the appeal for revocation, within the legal time frame. Concerning the right to form trade unions, which was allegedly violated by Decision No. /, an appeal was filed against Decision No. /, and was settled by Decision No. / of  March . The Decision could have been challenged by means of a hierarchical appeal, yet the administrative challenge was not exhausted.
.The Government indicates that, in accordance with section  of the CPE, trade unions shall enjoy legal personality solely by virtue of the fact that they organize and are recognized by their parent entities, and that recognition and legal personality can only be granted by the parent entities on which they are organizationally dependent. It also states that, in the present case, the complainant organization failed to indicate to the Constitutional Court and the Committee on Freedom of Association, that it was the one that requested its withdrawal from the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia and that, owing to this, the parent entity, by means of Decisions Nos / of  September  and / of  November , and Note LP-FSTPB / of  January , decided that the complainant organization be expelled with ignominy and that its union leave entitlement be immediately suspended, and to annul the decisions recognizing its leadership and union leave entitlement. The Government indicates that the work of the MTEPS is basically to ensure the formalities necessary for the decisions or organizational determinations made by these trade union organizations and their parent entities, as this Ministry cannot interfere in the affairs of these trade unions; in this regard, the MTEPS was responsible only for formalizing the decision made by the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, and therefore it is not possible to establish any violation of rights by the MTEPS. The Government indicates that all these elements were brought to the attention of the Constitutional Court, which issued Decision No. / of  March  rejecting the appeal filed.
.The Government emphasizes that: (i) the State recognizes and guarantees the right to freedom of association of unionized workers, and that trade union organizations enjoy legal personality solely by virtue of the fact that they organize and are recognized by their parent entities, as expressly established in paragraph IV of section  of the CPE; (ii) trade union organizations must furthermore comply with the obligation to legalize this legal personality through their registration with the MTEPS, for which they must comply with certain requirements set out in section  of the General Labour Act, that is,  they must legalize their legal  ersonality' and establish themselves in accordance with the legal rules'  which is a procedure that concludes with the issuance of the corresponding decision that proves the legal existence of the trade union organization, and enables the trade union organization and its representatives to exercise their rights, fulfil their purpose and carry out their activities vis--vis third parties; (iii) all trade union organizations must respect the legal rules, in particular, the essential requirement of being recognized by their parent entities; (iv) Decision No. / of  approving the requirements and procedures for formalities carried out by trade union organizations with the MTEPS, including the procedure for the recognition of trade union leadership and/or union leave entitlement, which establishes the documents to be submitted by trade union organizations; and (v) the recognition of the leadership of trade union organizations is of vital importance, in order for the State to guarantee the exercise of the rights granted to trade union leaders.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that the MTEPS illegally revoked ministerial decisions recognizing the leadership and union leave entitlement of leaders of the FDTPSC and of the five trade unions that belong to and founded the FDTPSC. It also alleges that, after these decisions had been revoked, acts of anti-union persecution and discrimination were carried out against members and leaders of the FDTPSC and the five trade unions, such as dismissals and the initiation of disciplinary proceedings.
.The Committee notes from the complaint and the Government s reply that: (i) in , five trade unions belonging to the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia took the decision to withdraw from it, established the FDTPSC, and requested the MTEPS to recognize the leadership and union leave entitlement of the members of the executive committee; (ii) on  October , the MTEPS issued Decision No. / recognizing the leadership of the FDTPSC for the period from  July  to  July , and declaring ten leaders from the FDTPSC as being on union leave; (iii) on  November , the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia challenged Decision No. / on the grounds that the essential requirement of being recognized by the parent entity had been overlooked during the procedure, thus violating section  of the CPE and Ministerial Decision No. /; (iv) on  November , the MTEPS confirmed that the procedure carried out by the FDTPSC had not been approved by the parent entity, and issued Decision No. / which revoked Decision No. /; and (v) on  November , the FDTPSC filed a hierarchical appeal against Decision No. /.
.The Committee also notes that: (i) on  January , the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia informed the MTEPS that the national conference of general secretaries of the country, held on  November , had decided to expel the leaders of the five trade unions from the trade union movement for their reprehensible acts of division and parallelism, who were disqualified from exercising trade union leadership; (ii) the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia informed the MTEPS that, as the trade unions had withdrawn from the parent organization, they no longer had approval from that organization, and requested the MTEPS to annul the decisions recognizing the leadership and union leave entitlement of the executive committees of the five trade unions issued under the de facto Government; (iii) on  February , the MTEPS issued Decision No. / which revoked the ministerial decisions concerning the five trade unions, as they did not have the approval of the parent entity; (iv) the trade unions filed an appeal for revocation and, on  March , the MTEPS confirmed Decision No. /; (iv) on  March , the FDTPSC filed an amparo appeal, requesting the suspension of Decision No. /; and (v) the Constitutional Court rejected the",-1,2021,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
3,"appeal filed.
.The Committee notes the complainant organization s allegations that: (i) the FDTPSC was established as a result of the abandonment of and failure to protect the five trade unions by the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia and as a result of its financial mismanagement; (ii) the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia lacked a legitimate interest in challenging Decision No. /, and that its aim was to harm the trade unions belonging to the FDTPSC, and to force them to rejoin the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia; (iii) since the ministerial decisions concerning the five trade unions were revoked, their leaders have been persecuted, harassed and, in some cases, dismissed without a judicial process, despite the fact that they had trade union immunity, as was the case for Mr Dimar Cspedes Zardn and Mr Freddy Vsquez Moreno; and (iv) the MTEPS has taken on the political task of impeding or hindering the functioning of the trade unions belonging to the FDTPSC, and has illegally recognized the leadership of parallel trade unions that have the approval of the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia, and that, although complaints were lodged in this respect, they were not addressed.
.In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s indication that: (i) trade union organizations enjoy legal personality solely by virtue of the fact that they organize and are recognized by their parent entities, as established in section  of the CPE; (ii) in accordance with Ministerial Decision No. /, which establishes the requirements and procedures for granting recognition of the leadership of trade union organizations, it is necessary to submit the approval or certification documents issued by the parent entity; (iii) all trade union organizations must respect the legal regulations, in particular, the essential requirement of being recognized by their parent entities; (iv) although in issuing Decision No. /, the authorities of the MTEPS considered that the procedure fulfilled the requirements, the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia exercised its constitutional right to petition, challenged the decision, and demonstrated that it had been issued without the approval of the parent entity; (v) Decisions Nos / and / were not issued arbitrarily but rather were in compliance with the procedure provided for by the Administrative Procedure Act, and are subject to the principle of legality and the presumption of legitimacy; (vi) the complainant organization did not exhaust the administrative procedure established by the Administrative Procedure Act, as, once a hierarchical appeal has been settled, it is possible to file a legal challenge through administrative dispute proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice; (vii) the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia is the parent entity that brings together all state unionized oil workers, and is also a member of the COB, which unites all workers in the country and which is the sole parent entity representing workers; and (viii) the organization, representation and activities of these parent entities are based on the principles contained in the CPE, in particular the principle of trade union unity and, consequently, the intention to create a parallel trade union organization constitutes a violation of the trade union principles established by the national legislation in place.
.The Committee observes that, while the facts of the present case point to the existence of a dispute among various currents of the trade union movement in the oil sector (within a political context characterized by changes of Government), the present complaint raises the question of the right of workers to form trade union organizations of their own choosing without necessarily having the authorization of a higher-level organization.
.The Committee in fact observes that the decision of the five trade unions referred to in this case to withdraw from the Trade Union Federation of Oil Workers of Bolivia and to form a new federation meant that they no longer had the approval of the parent entity, which led the MTEPS to revoke not only the decision recognizing the leadership and union leave entitlement of the FDTPSC, but also the decisions recognizing the leadership of the five trade unions, thus critically affecting the capacity for action of the above-mentioned organizations, as recognized by the Government in its reply.
.The Committee recalls that it has emphasized the importance that it attaches to the fact that workers and employers should in practice be able to establish and join organizations of their own choosing in full freedom [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. While it duly notes the Government s indication that all trade union organizations must respect the applicable regulations, which include the requirement of being recognized by their parent entities, the Committee recalls that, although the founders of a trade union should comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to impair the free establishment of organizations. The Committee also recalls that the acquisition of legal personality by workers' organizations, federations and confederations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a nature as to restrict the exercise of the right to establish and join federations and confederations of their own choosing, and that the requirement that a trade union is obliged to obtain the recommendation of a specific central organization in order to be duly recognized constitutes an obstacle for workers to establish freely the organization of their own choosing and is therefore contrary to freedom of association [see Compilation, paras , and ].
.Taking due note that the Bolivian trade union movement is characterized by the importance given to trade union unity, and recalling that, while it is generally to the advantage of workers and employers to avoid the proliferation of competing organizations, a monopoly situation imposed by law is at variance with the principle of free choice of workers' and employers' organizations, and that, in previous cases, the Committee indicated that the obligation for trade unions to obtain the consent of a central trade union organization in order to be registered must be removed [see Compilation, paras  and ], the Committee requests the Government to initiate constructive dialogue with all parties concerned, with a view to identifying the necessary reforms, to ensure that workers can freely establish the organizations of their own choosing, even without the authorization of a higher-level trade union organization. The Committee refers the legislative aspects of this case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and reminds the Government that, if it so wishes, it may avail itself of the technical assistance of the Office.
.With regard to the application of section  of the CPE to the organizations concerned in the present case, the Committee requests the Government to take specific steps to ensure that these organizations can register, in full freedom, the executive committees of their own choosing, even without the authorization of a higher-level trade union. It requests the Government to keep the Committee informed in this regard. The Committee also requests the complainant organization to inform it of the outcome of the hierarchical appeal filed against Decision No. /, and to indicate whether it has challenged the ministerial decisions that are the subject of the present case through the administrative dispute process before the Supreme Court of Justice.
.Lastly, observing that the Government s reply does not refer directly to the alleged acts of anti-union persecution and discrimination, including the dismissal of former leaders of Trade Union I, Mr Cspedes Zardn and Mr Freddy Vsquez Moreno, allegedly dismissed without a judicial process, despite the fact that they had trade union immunity, the Committee urges the Government to respond specifically to these allegations. The Committee recalls in this regard that no person shall be prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, whether past or present, and that protection against anti-union discrimination applies equally to trade union members and former trade union officials as to current trade union leaders. It also recalls that, if it appears that the dismissals occurred as a result of involvement by the workers concerned in the activities of a union, the Government must ensure that those workers are reinstated in their jobs without loss of pay [see Compilation, paras ,  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on the status of all the complaints lodged by the complainant organization with the MTEPS in this regard, and requests the complainant organization to indicate whether legal proceedings have been initiated in relation to the alleged dismissals and other acts of anti-union persecution and discrimination.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to initiate constructive dialogue with all the concerned parties, with a view to identifying the necessary reforms, to ensure that workers can freely establish the organizations of their own choosing, even without the authorization of a higher-level trade union organization. The",-1,2021,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

It requests the Government to keep the Committee informed in this regard.(c) The Committee requests the complainant organization to inform it of the outcome of the hierarchical appeal filed against Decision No. /, and to indicate whether it has challenged the ministerial decisions that are the subject of the present case through administrative dispute proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice.(d) The Committee urges the Government to respond specifically to the allegations of acts of anti-union persecution and discrimination, including the alleged dismissal of the former leaders of Trade Union I, Mr Dimar Cspedes Zardn and Mr Freddy Vsquez Moreno, allegedly dismissed without a judicial process, despite the fact that they had trade union immunity.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on the status of all the complaints lodged by the complainant organization with the MTEPS in this regard, and requests the complainant organization to indicate whether legal proceedings have been initiated in relation to the alleged dismissals and other acts of anti-union persecution and discrimination.",-1,2021,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
5,".The complaint covered by Case No.  is contained in three communications from the Federation of Medical and Allied Trade Unions (FESIMRAS) dated  April,  May and  July . The complaint covered by Case No.  is contained in two communications from the Bolivian Workers' Federation (COB) dated  and  June . Since the complaints are concerned with identical issues, the Committee decided to examine Cases Nos  and  together.
.The Government sent its observations in two communications, both dated  May .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the Federation of Medical and Allied Trade Unions (FESIMRAS) indicates that on  December  it presented a set of  demands to the Ministry of Health, including a point relating to the institutionalization of basic posts. The complainant organization indicates that, under section  of the regulations implementing the General Labour Act, the employer had ten days in which to reply and, on  April , since there had been no reply from the Ministry of Health, FESIMRAS presented its list of demands to the Ministry of Labour and asked for a conciliation board to be set up. This request was repeated on  August  but there was still no reply from the aforementioned Ministry.
.The complainant federation states that the Ministry of Labour s failure to reply to its list of demands, combined with the discontent caused by the appointment of a new chief administrator for the National Health Fund who did not meet the professional profile requirements for holding that post, obliged the complainant to take industrial action, which resulted in a series of graduated strikes lasting ,  and  hours and an undefined strike, from December  to February , during which emergency services were reinforced. The complainant indicates that the Ministry of Health filed a request with the Ministry of Labour to have each of the strikes declared illegal, which was accepted on the grounds that the provision of health services should not be interrupted (article  of the Constitution), that the General Labour Act prohibited work stoppages in public services (section ), that Supreme Decree No.  of  March  prohibited strikes in health services, and that conciliation and arbitration procedures had not been exhausted.
.The complainant federation emphasizes that all the administrative decisions were challenged by a series of appeals for administrative review but it considers that its arguments were disregarded, since the Government had used political rhetoric to confirm that the strikes were illegal, and the complainant questions the impartiality of the administrative authority, which, in its opinion, played the role of both judge and party. In addition, the complainant considers that these decisions are incompatible with the current constitutional context in Bolivia, since the Constitution guarantees strike action as a means of defending workers' rights, and that the administrative authority based itself on an already repealed former Constitution, which made the right to strike dependent on  prior compliance with legal procedures'  Lastly, the complainant emphasizes that there has been no response to its list of demands to date.
.In its communication of  May , the complainant federation indicates that, as reprisals for its previous actions, the Government issued Supreme Decrees Nos  and  (of  February ) and promulgated Act No.  (of  March ). The complainant considers that these pieces of legislation contain references which discriminate against the right to strike and are contrary to the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention,  (No. ), since they jeopardize the fundamental right to short-term social security, modify regulations concerning free affiliation, disaffiliation and reaffiliation in relation to social security schemes and could make medical services more precarious. In addition, the complainant organization emphasizes that the Government failed to hold any prior consultations with the trade unions as regards adopting the above-mentioned legislation and indicates that in view of the lack of guarantees of good-faith dialogue, the Medical College of Bolivia and the National Health Commission carried out further strikes on  and  May , calling for the repeal of the above-mentioned items of legislation.
.According to FESIMRAS, after the announcement of a third strike due to last  hours, the Ombudsperson brought a class action (similar to amparo (for the protection of constitutional rights)) with a view to obtaining a judicial prohibition of the right to strike. The complainant denounces the action of the Ombudsperson since, in its opinion, far from playing an autonomous role with regard to the public authorities, he used the judicial action for political purposes, and the complainant questioned the ruling of the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal, which granted partial protection of rights to the Ombudsperson. In this respect, the complainant federation claims that: (i) the Ombudsperson merely summoned the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Health as interested third parties to a hearing, excluding the trade unions which had a particular interest in the matter; (ii) during the strikes there was no risk to human life, since all emergency services were reinforced, in line with the principle established by the Committee on Freedom of Association of providing a minimum service in the event of a strike; (iii) both the court and the Ombudsperson disregarded the fact that the right to strike plays a pivotal role since better observance of the right to health depends on it; (iv) if the restriction on the Medical College of Bolivia s right to strike is upheld in the pending review of the class action, a precedent could be set for the penalization of strikes, which could be extended to other sectors and would place trade union leaders in a vulnerable situation with regard to criminal prosecution; (v) in a previous case, the Committee on Freedom of Association asked the Government of Bolivia to take steps to ensure that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties; and (vi) some of the arguments of the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal were based on sub-constitutional legislation, since it took account of principles from the repealed Constitution of  concerning prior compliance with legal formalities, and mistakenly also assumed the sub-constitutional provisions relating to section  of the General Labour Act, Supreme Decree No.  and Decree-Law No. , promulgated by a military junta, to be applicable.
.In its communications dated  and  June , the Bolivian Workers' Federation (COB) states that the entry into force of Supreme Decrees Nos  and  and the promulgation of Act No.  sparked protests in the medical sector, which took the form of strikes calling for the repeal of these items of legislation on account of the alleged risk to the survival of the health funds. The complainant states, with regard to the issuing and promulgation of the above-mentioned legislation, that: (i) with the setting up of the National Health System Inspection and Monitoring Authority, established by Supreme Decree No. , the Government is arbitrarily deciding on the disappearance of the health funds, giving employers the freedom to disaffiliate their workers, without consulting them and without the obligation to reaffiliate them to a similar body; (ii) after a -hour stoppage in the health sector was announced, the Ombudsperson filed a class action with the purpose of securing a judicial prohibition of the right to strike to the Medical College of Bolivia; (iii) with regard to the class action filed by the Ombudsperson, the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal granted partial protection of rights to the plaintiff, prohibiting the right to strike at the Medical College of Bolivia on the simplistic grounds of the right to health prevailing over the right to strike; (iv) the strikes of the Medical College of Bolivia would not have constituted a danger to life since the medical services had been reinforced in line with the principle of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning the provision of a minimum service; (v) both the Ombudsperson and the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal deliberately disregarded the fact that the Medical College of Bolivia only sought to defend the short-term social security health funds and the right to health of workers and their families affiliated to such entities, who account for  per cent of the Bolivian population; and (vi) if the ruling is upheld, it could signify a harmful legal precedent involving the penalization of strikes, in particular for manual workers employed by the health funds.
.In addition, the COB makes allegations of favouritism and interference in union matters and the creation of parallel unions. The complainant states that the Ministry of Labour recognizes parallel trade unions, supposedly affiliated to the federation, and that recognition is granted to them by the ministry extremely quickly, by comparison with the legitimate organizations affiliated to the COB. The complainant refers specifically to the situation of the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers, where",-1,2017,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
6,"a former leader of the organization organized ordinary congresses without authorization from the federation, as a result of which he was expelled from the organization. The complainant objects to the fact that, even though not all requirements for recognition, including approval by the COB, had been met, the Ministry of Labour issued a ministerial decision granting recognition to the parallel executive committee just six hours after the application was made. Nevertheless, the COB states that when the new executive committee of the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers, which had been legitimately elected at an ordinary congress held on  and  March , requested recognition from the Ministry of Labour and asked for the parallel executive committee to be invalidated, the ministry reportedly failed to rectify the situation in favour of the legitimate union.
.In its communication of  May , the Government indicates with regard to the allegations made by FESIMRAS concerning violations of the right to strike that: (i) freedom of association is a right of workers and trade unions to assemble and defend their common interests; (ii) although the National Constitution guarantees the right to strike as a statutory right, it also guarantees the right to health and stipulates that the  provision of health services shall not be interrupted'  (iii) due procedures for exercising the right to strike are laid down in chapter I of title X of the General Labour Act, and also in chapter X of the regulations implementing the General Labour Act; (iv) Constitutional Ruling No. / of  January  established that  fundamental rights are not absolute but encounter limits and restrictions in the form of the rights of others, the prevalence of the general interest, the primacy of the legal system and factors of public safety, morality and health, which cannot be sacrificed to the arbitrary exercise or misuse of individual prerogatives; in other words, fundamental rights may be limited in relation to the social interest'  (v) Constitutional Ruling No. /-R of  April  established that  persons may not exercise their rights in an unrestricted and arbitrary manner to the detriment of the rights of others and so the exercise thereof must be regulated'  (vi) in the present case, since there was no reply from the ministry which was competent to respond to its list of demands or convene the conciliation board, FESIMRAS took industrial action without taking into consideration that there were other appropriate means of challenging the lack of a timely reply to the requests made by the public servants and that they might even incur penalties; (vii) the strikes were analysed by the La Paz Departmental Labour Office and the Directorate-General of Labour, Occupational Safety and Health, which are answerable to the Ministry of Labour, and were declared illegal for not meeting regulatory requirements; and (viii) subsequently, FESIMRAS once again had recourse to industrial action, finding that Supreme Decrees Nos  and  and Act No.  made references which discriminated against the right to strike and undermined the right to health, and once again these measures were declared illegal since due procedures had not been followed.
.Consequently, the Government considers that international instruments for the protection of human rights which form part of the constitutional bloc do not merely proclaim the whole range of rights, freedoms and guarantees but also serve to establish the particular conditions in which the State may restrict or limit rights and define violations. In the present case, the Bolivian people s right to health and life should prevail over the complainant federation s right to strike.
.As regards the allegations made by the COB concerning the content of Supreme Decrees Nos  and  and also Act No. , the Government indicates that the legal foundation of these pieces of legislation, far from being aimed at the abolition or disappearance of the health funds, is based on the constitutional recognition of the right to health, which the State has the obligation to guarantee. Furthermore, the Government considers that the purpose of issuing Supreme Decree No.  was to improve the health services; nevertheless, after a number of observations made by various parties, a process to amend that decree has been launched and that process is being handled by the Social and Economic Policy Analysis Unit.
.With regard to the complainant s allegations of restrictions on the right to strike in the public health sector, the Government states that: (i) section  of the General Labour Act prohibits work stoppages in public services; (ii) section  of Supreme Decree No.  provides that health services form part of public services for the purposes of section  of the General Labour Act; (iii) Constitutional Ruling No. / states that fundamental rights may be limited in relation to the public interest; (iv) essential services are defined by the ILO Committee of Experts as  services the interruption of which might endanger the life, safety or health of the whole or part of the population'  (v) according to the report issued by the Directorate-General of Health, during the stoppage in the sector on  and  May , the right to health of at least , people across the country was violated,  planned surgical operations were suspended and , external consultations were postponed in third-level hospitals (referral or highly specialized hospitals); (vi) according to Administrative Decision No. - of  May , issued by the Director-General of Labour, Occupational Safety and Health at the Ministry of Labour, conciliation procedures have not been exhausted; and (vii) in its ruling on the class action, the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal granted partial protection of rights to the Ombudsperson, on the grounds that the Medical College of Bolivia had the duty to guarantee the right to health under normal conditions to all users and that these conditions had to be guaranteed by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour under the powers conferred on them by the Constitution and the legislation.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the Federation of Medical and Allied Trade Unions (FESIMRAS) and the Bolivian Workers' Federation (COB) denounce restrictions on the right to strike in the public health sector. The Committee also observes that FESIMRAS alleges that the trade unions were not consulted prior to the adoption of legislation affecting their interests and that the COB denounces the creation of parallel unions and favouritism and interference in union matters on the part of the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee notes that, according to FESIMRAS, after an initial series of strikes in the public health sector in protest at lack of action by the Ministry of Labour as regards the setting up of a conciliation board and the controversial appointment of a chief administrator for the National Health Fund, the Ministry of Health instituted various administrative proceedings to declare the strikes illegal, and these proceedings were decided in favour of the Ministry, as were the appeals subsequently filed by FESIMRAS for administrative review of those decisions. In addition, both complainant organizations indicate that, on account of the issuing of Supreme Decrees Nos  and  and the enactment of Act No. , two further strikes were held and that, after a third strike due to last  hours was announced, the Ombudsperson filed a class action (similar to amparo (for the protection of constitutional rights)) with the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal, which ruled partly in favour of the plaintiff, prohibiting the continuation of the strikes.
.As regards the first series of strikes declared illegal by the administrative authority, the Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges that: (i) legislative provisions of sub-constitutional status were applied, supposedly with reference to a former Constitution; (ii) the above-mentioned administrative decisions declaring the strikes illegal are incompatible with the current constitutional context in Bolivia; (iii) these administrative decisions could lead to criminal prosecution for the leaders of the striking organizations; and (iv) the Government acted as both judge and party in the proceedings for declaring the strikes illegal and also in the complainant s appeals for administrative review.
.With regard to the second series of strikes and the class action filed by the Ombudsperson, the Committee notes that both complainant organizations claim that: (i) the Ombudsperson used the class action for political purposes; (ii) the operations of the emergency services were reinforced, fulfilling the requirements of a minimum service; (iii) the ruling of the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal was challenged and if the restriction was upheld, an important precedent would be set regarding the exercise of strike action; (iv) in a previous case concerning a declaration of a strike as illegal by the administrative authority, the Committee asked the Government to take steps to ensure that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies with an independent and impartial body; and (v) in the present case the Government gave the right to health precedence over the right to strike.
.With regard to both complainants' allegations of restrictions on strike action, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: (i) the",-1,2017,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
7,"Directorate-General of Labour and Occupational Safety and Health has the duty to declare by an administrative decision whether a national strike is legal or illegal; (ii) due procedures relating to strike action, including conciliation, were not followed; (iii) other suitable measures exist for the complainants to challenge the lack of a reply to their requests; (iv) the National Constitution stipulates that the provision of health services must not be interrupted; (v) the Constitutional Court has considered that fundamental rights are not absolute but are subject to limits and restrictions in accordance with the public interest and public health factors; (vi) section  of the General Labour Act prohibits the suspension of work in public services, including health services; and (vii) the health service is an essential service.
.The Committee underlines that the right to strike is not an absolute right and, in specific circumstances, provision may be made to restrict or even prohibit it. The Committee recalls that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country. Moreover, this concept is not absolute, in the sense that a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population and that the Committee has previously stated that the hospital sector may be considered an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ].
.The Committee reminds the Government that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government but with an independent and impartial body [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting that responsibility still lies with the administrative authority to determine the legality of a strike, the Committee considers that although restrictions may exist on strike action in the cases referred to above, it would be necessary for an independent body to have previously determined the scope of such a restriction and therefore once again requests the Government to take measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that if it is necessary for a strike to be declared illegal, responsibility for that declaration lies with an independent and impartial body.
.With regard to the alleged inadequate functioning of compensatory guarantees, the Committee recalls that as regards the nature of appropriate guarantees in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, restrictions on the right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting the contradictory versions from the complainants and the Government regarding effective access to conciliation and arbitration, the Committee trusts that the Government will ensure the adequate, impartial and speedy functioning of conciliation and arbitration proceedings in order to restore the unions' confidence in compensatory guarantees and consequently will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged adoption of social security regulations without prior consultation of the trade unions and also the lack of guarantees concerning good-faith dialogue, the Committee notes the Government s indication, regarding Supreme Decree No. , that following certain observations made by various parties, steps were taken towards amending the aforementioned decree. In this regard, the Committee has emphasized the value of consulting organizations of employers and workers during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests and has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. Observing that in the present case Decrees Nos  and  were replaced by Supreme Decree No.  of  January , the Committee hopes that in future full consultations will be held with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations on draft labour or social legislation which affects their interests or those of their members and consequently will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.As regards the favouritism and interference in union matters by the public authorities and the creation of parallel unions alleged by the COB, and specifically the situation of the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers, where the Ministry of Labour reportedly recognized an executive committee which had not been democratically elected, the Committee recalls that when two executive committees each proclaim themselves to be the legitimate one, the dispute should be settled by the judicial authority or an independent arbitrator, and not by the administrative authority [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. Observing that the Government has not sent its observations on these allegations, the Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on this matter.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee once again requests the Government to take measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that if it is necessary for a strike to be declared illegal, responsibility for that declaration lies with an independent and impartial body.(b)	With regard to the favouritism and interference in union matters and the creation of parallel unions alleged by the Bolivian Workers' Federation, the Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on this matter.",-1,2017,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
8,".The complaint covered by Case No.  is contained in three communications from the Federation of Medical and Allied Trade Unions (FESIMRAS) dated  April,  May and  July . The complaint covered by Case No.  is contained in two communications from the Bolivian Workers' Federation (COB) dated  and  June . Since the complaints are concerned with identical issues, the Committee decided to examine Cases Nos  and  together.
.The Government sent its observations in two communications, both dated  May .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the Federation of Medical and Allied Trade Unions (FESIMRAS) indicates that on  December  it presented a set of  demands to the Ministry of Health, including a point relating to the institutionalization of basic posts. The complainant organization indicates that, under section  of the regulations implementing the General Labour Act, the employer had ten days in which to reply and, on  April , since there had been no reply from the Ministry of Health, FESIMRAS presented its list of demands to the Ministry of Labour and asked for a conciliation board to be set up. This request was repeated on  August  but there was still no reply from the aforementioned Ministry.
.The complainant federation states that the Ministry of Labour s failure to reply to its list of demands, combined with the discontent caused by the appointment of a new chief administrator for the National Health Fund who did not meet the professional profile requirements for holding that post, obliged the complainant to take industrial action, which resulted in a series of graduated strikes lasting ,  and  hours and an undefined strike, from December  to February , during which emergency services were reinforced. The complainant indicates that the Ministry of Health filed a request with the Ministry of Labour to have each of the strikes declared illegal, which was accepted on the grounds that the provision of health services should not be interrupted (article  of the Constitution), that the General Labour Act prohibited work stoppages in public services (section ), that Supreme Decree No.  of  March  prohibited strikes in health services, and that conciliation and arbitration procedures had not been exhausted.
.The complainant federation emphasizes that all the administrative decisions were challenged by a series of appeals for administrative review but it considers that its arguments were disregarded, since the Government had used political rhetoric to confirm that the strikes were illegal, and the complainant questions the impartiality of the administrative authority, which, in its opinion, played the role of both judge and party. In addition, the complainant considers that these decisions are incompatible with the current constitutional context in Bolivia, since the Constitution guarantees strike action as a means of defending workers' rights, and that the administrative authority based itself on an already repealed former Constitution, which made the right to strike dependent on  prior compliance with legal procedures'  Lastly, the complainant emphasizes that there has been no response to its list of demands to date.
.In its communication of  May , the complainant federation indicates that, as reprisals for its previous actions, the Government issued Supreme Decrees Nos  and  (of  February ) and promulgated Act No.  (of  March ). The complainant considers that these pieces of legislation contain references which discriminate against the right to strike and are contrary to the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention,  (No. ), since they jeopardize the fundamental right to short-term social security, modify regulations concerning free affiliation, disaffiliation and reaffiliation in relation to social security schemes and could make medical services more precarious. In addition, the complainant organization emphasizes that the Government failed to hold any prior consultations with the trade unions as regards adopting the above-mentioned legislation and indicates that in view of the lack of guarantees of good-faith dialogue, the Medical College of Bolivia and the National Health Commission carried out further strikes on  and  May , calling for the repeal of the above-mentioned items of legislation.
.According to FESIMRAS, after the announcement of a third strike due to last  hours, the Ombudsperson brought a class action (similar to amparo (for the protection of constitutional rights)) with a view to obtaining a judicial prohibition of the right to strike. The complainant denounces the action of the Ombudsperson since, in its opinion, far from playing an autonomous role with regard to the public authorities, he used the judicial action for political purposes, and the complainant questioned the ruling of the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal, which granted partial protection of rights to the Ombudsperson.

.In addition, the COB makes allegations of favouritism and interference in union matters and the creation of parallel unions. The complainant states that the Ministry of Labour recognizes parallel trade unions, supposedly affiliated to the federation, and that recognition is granted to them by the ministry extremely quickly, by comparison with the legitimate organizations affiliated to the COB. The complainant refers specifically to the situation of the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers, where",-1,2017,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

The complainant objects to the fact that, even though not all requirements for recognition, including approval by the COB, had been met, the Ministry of Labour issued a ministerial decision granting recognition to the parallel executive committee just six hours after the application was made. Nevertheless, the COB states that when the new executive committee of the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers, which had been legitimately elected at an ordinary congress held on  and  March , requested recognition from the Ministry of Labour and asked for the parallel executive committee to be invalidated, the ministry reportedly failed to rectify the situation in favour of the legitimate union.
.In its communication of  May , the Government indicates with regard to the allegations made by FESIMRAS concerning violations of the right to strike that: (i) freedom of association is a right of workers and trade unions to assemble and defend their common interests; (ii) although the National Constitution guarantees the right to strike as a statutory right, it also guarantees the right to health and stipulates that the  provision of health services shall not be interrupted'  (iii) due procedures for exercising the right to strike are laid down in chapter I of title X of the General Labour Act, and also in chapter X of the regulations implementing the General Labour Act; (iv) Constitutional Ruling No. / of  January  established that  fundamental rights are not absolute but encounter limits and restrictions in the form of the rights of others, the prevalence of the general interest, the primacy of the legal system and factors of public safety, morality and health, which cannot be sacrificed to the arbitrary exercise or misuse of individual prerogatives; in other words, fundamental rights may be limited in relation to the social interest'  (v) Constitutional Ruling No. /-R of  April  established that  persons may not exercise their rights in an unrestricted and arbitrary manner to the detriment of the rights of others and so the exercise thereof must be regulated'  (vi) in the present case, since there was no reply from the ministry which was competent to respond to its list of demands or convene the conciliation board, FESIMRAS took industrial action without taking into consideration that there were other appropriate means of challenging the lack of a timely reply to the requests made by the public servants and that they might even incur penalties; (vii) the strikes were analysed by the La Paz Departmental Labour Office and the Directorate-General of Labour, Occupational Safety and Health, which are answerable to the Ministry of Labour, and were declared illegal for not meeting regulatory requirements; and (viii) subsequently, FESIMRAS once again had recourse to industrial action, finding that Supreme Decrees Nos  and  and Act No.  made references which discriminated against the right to strike and undermined the right to health, and once again these measures were declared illegal since due procedures had not been followed.

.The Committee underlines that the right to strike is not an absolute right and, in specific circumstances, provision may be made to restrict or even prohibit it. The Committee recalls that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; or () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country. Moreover, this concept is not absolute, in the sense that a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population and that the Committee has previously stated that the hospital sector may be considered an essential service [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ].
.The Committee reminds the Government that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government but with an independent and impartial body [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting that responsibility still lies with the administrative authority to determine the legality of a strike, the Committee considers that although restrictions may exist on strike action in the cases referred to above, it would be necessary for an independent body to have previously determined the scope of such a restriction and therefore once again requests the Government to take measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that if it is necessary for a strike to be declared illegal, responsibility for that declaration lies with an independent and impartial body.
.With regard to the alleged inadequate functioning of compensatory guarantees, the Committee recalls that as regards the nature of appropriate guarantees in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, restrictions on the right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. While noting the contradictory versions from the complainants and the Government regarding effective access to conciliation and arbitration, the Committee trusts that the Government will ensure the adequate, impartial and speedy functioning of conciliation and arbitration proceedings in order to restore the unions' confidence in compensatory guarantees and consequently will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.As regards the alleged adoption of social security regulations without prior consultation of the trade unions and also the lack of guarantees concerning good-faith dialogue, the Committee notes the Government s indication, regarding Supreme Decree No. , that following certain observations made by various parties, steps were taken towards amending the aforementioned decree. In this regard, the Committee has emphasized the value of consulting organizations of employers and workers during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests and has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Compilation, op. cit., paras  and ]. Observing that in the present case Decrees Nos  and  were replaced by Supreme Decree No.  of  January , the Committee hopes that in future full consultations will be held with the most representative workers' and employers' organizations on draft labour or social legislation which affects their interests or those of their members and consequently will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.As regards the favouritism and interference in union matters by the public authorities and the creation of parallel unions alleged by the COB, and specifically the situation of the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers, where the Ministry of Labour reportedly recognized an executive committee which had not been democratically elected, the Committee recalls that when two executive committees each proclaim themselves to be the legitimate one, the dispute should be settled by the judicial authority or an independent arbitrator, and not by the administrative authority [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. Observing that the Government has not sent its observations on these allegations, the Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on this matter.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee once again requests the Government to take measures, including legislative measures, to ensure that if it is necessary for a strike to be declared illegal, responsibility for that declaration lies with an independent and impartial body.(b)	With regard to the favouritism and interference in union matters and the creation of parallel unions alleged by the Bolivian Workers' Federation, the Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information on this matter.",-1,2017,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
11,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Federation of Medical Practitioners' Unions and Allied Branches of the National Health Fund (FESIMRAS) dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the FESIMRAS states that in September  the Ministry of Health approved a draft bill proposing, as a matter of priority and in the national interest, a plan to reorganize the National Health Fund (hereinafter the Fund), which was approved by Supreme Decree No.  of  November . The complainant alleges that the draft bill on Fund reorganization imposes restrictions on the functioning of health professionals' trade union and collegial bodies, and that, if approved, the bill will affect their rights of organization, member representation and collective bargaining.
.The complainant refers, firstly, to article () of the draft bill, which asserts that the posts of health professionals and workers will be assigned on the basis of a merit-based competition held in accordance with specific regulations issued by the Ministry of Health (institutionalization procedures) without the involvement of professional colleges and associations. Paragraph IV of the same article states that an institutionalization committee is being created without the participation of professional colleges and associations and with membership comprising the Ministry of Health, the highest executive authority of the Fund or its representative and the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB).
.The complainant also refers to a single abrogative and derogatory clause in the draft bill that provides for the invalidation of articles  and  of Law No. , which recognize the Medical College of Bolivia as the leading body for medical professionals in organizational, scientific, trade union and professional development matters. The complainant also states that the single transitional provision in the draft bill introduces new grounds for the dismissal of Fund staff which contrast with those set out in article  of the General Labour Act and are detrimental to the employment stability proclaimed and guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic. Specifically, the single transitional provision in the draft bill states:  the following are considered to be non-compliance with the employment contract or agreement and as cause for dismissal subject to proceedings in the framework of article  of the General Labour Act: incompatible family relationship; nepotism; influence peddling; falsification of academic certificates and other documents submitted in the course of recruitment or institutionalization; trafficking and/or diversion of patients to private clinics in contravention of the institution s interests; improper use of institutional property for private reasons, and proven abuse of patients' 
.In its communication dated  April , the Government transmits a report by the National Legal Department of the Fund, dated  March , and a report by the Legal Department of the Ministry of Health dated  March .
.The report by the National Legal Department of the Fund states that the draft bill does not violate any existing legal provision, in particular because it is still at the draft stage and has yet to be approved. The report also points out that, in accordance with articles ,  and  of the National Constitution and articles (), ,  and  of the Constitutional Procedure Code, queries, amendments and changes must be submitted to the Legislative Assembly or, where appropriate, the Chamber of Senators.
.The report by the Legal Department of the Ministry of Health states that, under the National Constitution, the right of legislative initiative is granted to the government, senators and parliamentary deputies for the purpose of submitting to the Chambers a text which then becomes law once approved by them. The report emphasizes that the draft bill in question was written in clear, accurate and consistent terms, with grounds for cause, and that, since it has not yet been dealt with by the Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia, no law has been promulgated. The report concludes that the complaint submitted by FESIMRAS lacks any real substance and that, because it refers to a draft bill which is not yet law in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, no violation of its trade union rights has occurred.
.The Committee observes that in the present case, FESIMRAS alleges that in September  the Ministry of Health approved a draft bill concerning reorganization of the Fund which imposes restrictions on the functioning of health professionals' trade union and collegial bodies and which, if approved, would affect their rights of organization, member representation and collective bargaining. The Committee notes that, in its reply, the Government confines itself to pointing out that the draft bill on reorganization of the Fund has not yet been dealt with by the Legislative Assembly and that therefore no violation of trade union rights has occurred.
.The Committee observes that, although the draft bill invalidates the provisions of Law No.  which recognize the Medical College of Bolivia as the leading union body for medical professionals and specifically excludes the professional colleges and associations from taking part in the merit-based competition process to institutionalize posts and in the committee being set up for that purpose, it expressly recognizes the participation of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB) in the joint committee alongside the Ministry of Health and the highest executive authority of the Fund. The Committee also observes that, as stated in the draft bill, the COB contributed to the Fund reorganization plan and that, according to Article  of Supreme Decree No.  concerning institutionalization of the Fund, the COB represents the workers' sector on the Fund s governing board. In this regard, while it does not know the level of representativeness of the sector s various union bodies, the Committee recalls that the fact that a trade union organization is debarred from membership of joint committees does not necessarily imply infringement of the trade union rights of that organization. But for there to be no infringement, two conditions must be met: first, that the reason for which a union is debarred from participation in a joint committee must lie in its non-representative character, determined by objective criteria; second, that in spite of such non-participation, the other rights which it enjoys and the activities it can undertake in other fields must enable it effectively to further and defend the interests of its members within the meaning of Article  of Convention No.  [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.Furthermore, the Committee recalls that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate organizations of workers and employers [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In a previous case presented by FESIMRAS which also concerned a plan to reorganize the Fund, the Committee emphasized the importance it attaches to the promotion of dialogue and consultation on matters of common interest between the public authorities and the most representative professional bodies in the sector concerned [see rd Report, Case No. , para. ]. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee expects that the Government will ensure that the draft bill on reorganization of the Fund, before being submitted to Parliament, will be the subject of consultation with representative workers' and employers' organizations from the sector, and that it will comply fully with the abovementioned principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee expects that the Government will ensure that the draft bill on reorganization of the Fund, before being submitted to Parliament, will be the subject of consultation with representative workers' and employers' organizations from the sector and that it will comply fully with the principles of freedom of association.",-1,2015,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
12,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June , submitted by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  November .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the COB alleges that, in connection with the general strike held in May , serious acts of violence were carried out against demonstrators, and union officials suffered illegal detentions, criminal proceedings and persecution, in violation of the right to strike and the rights enshrined in Convention No. . The complainant also reports that the strike was declared illegal by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare and that workers' wages were deducted on the basis of a declaration of illegality by a non-independent body.
.The complainant indicates that on  February  it presented a list of claims to the Government requesting, among other things, the amendment of the Act on Pensions, No. . The complainant indicates that, as the Government did not offer concrete solutions to the claims included on the list, on  March  negotiations began between the COB and the Government, which concluded on  April  with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in which they undertook to address the claims included on the list. The complainant organization highlights that, in the Memorandum of Understanding, the Government adopted a decision to review the Act on Pensions, No. , and promised that a joint committee of the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the COB would present a technical and financial review of the Act on  April , at the latest.
.The complainant organization indicates that, in view of the failure to meet the deadlines established in the Memorandum of Understanding and the Government s refusal to engage in dialogue, on  April  the COB issued a resolution ( National Resolution'  declaring a general strike, involving the suspension of labour activities and continuous demonstrations, including roadblocks throughout the country as of  May .
.The complainant organization adds that during the demonstrations of the general strike, union officials were illegally detained, criminal proceedings were filed against them and they suffered persecution. Workers were the victims of brutal acts of repression at the hands of the national police and some workers in the Cochabamba industrial sector received bullet wounds. The complainant adds that, on  May , an armed police officer was identified among the ranks of COB demonstrators in the city of La Paz, and on  May  the home of a COB official was searched by unidentified persons, two incidents which remain unexplained.
.The complainant indicates that the strike organized by the COB was declared illegal by Administrative Resolution No. - of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare, of  May , on the grounds that it was not in conformity with the procedure provided under section  of the General Labour Act. According to that provision,  any unscheduled stoppage of work in any enterprise by either employers or workers shall be prohibited until all means of conciliation and arbitration provided under the present title have been exhausted, otherwise the stoppage shall be deemed illegal'  The complainant alleges that it complied with the provisions of section  of the General Labour Act and explains that the procedure established therein had been interrupted by the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, which prevented proceeding to arbitration. In any case, the complainant insists that the declaration of illegality must be issued by an independent body, as the Committee has requested in previous cases.
.On  May , the complainant requested the Government to engage in dialogue, and on  May  the Government sent a letter to the COB in which it promised that a joint committee of the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the COB would present proposals for amendments to the Act on Pensions within  days. The COB accepted the Government s proposal, it lifted the strike and declared a recess, which was maintained during the -day period proposed by the Government.
.On  May , the COB together with the Trade Union Confederation of Public Health Workers of Bolivia, the National Federation of Social Security Workers of Bolivia, and the National Federation of Workers of the Oil Workers Health Fund lodged an appeal against Administrative Resolution No. - declaring the strike illegal, and they requested the Government to annul deductions of up to  per cent of workers' wages until a ruling on the appeal had been issued. Lastly, on  June , a letter was sent to the Minister of Health (No. /) indicating that the wage deductions of more than  per cent could not be carried out until a ruling had been issued in respect of the appeal against Administrative Resolution No. - declaring the strike illegal. In the letter, the complainant alleged that the wage deductions that had been applied to workers were illegal because they were carried out while the appeal was still pending resolution.
.In its communication of  November , the Government indicates that the complaint presented by the COB lacks solid arguments to support the accusations made and that the Government has at all times resorted to dialogue as the only means of reaching a solution with regard to the claims of the COB and its member sectors. In this regard, the Government states that it sent an answer, addressing the  list of claims submitted by the COB point by point, in a document entitled  Government response to the national list of claims of the Bolivian Workers' Federation - ' 
.The Government indicates that, in the Memorandum of Understanding signed on  April , it undertook to address the list of claims, according the same level of interest to all the points, but that the COB referred to the issue of the Act on Pensions as the most important issue on the  list of claims, thereby accelerating without justification the COB s decision of  April to declare a general strike, involving the stoppage of labour activities and continuous demonstrations with roadblocks throughout the country as of  May . The Government points out that the trade union s resolution itself implies that the Government did not abandon the dialogue proceedings, since it indicates that the COB rejected the  distracting proposals regarding the review of the Act on Pensions which do not meet the demands laid out in the list of claims'  The Government insists that, while it was busy enforcing the Memorandum of Understanding, the COB was the one which rejected its proposals, thereby accelerating the general strike.
.As regards the argument put forward by the complainant that the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (with which the Government allegedly failed to comply) interrupted the arbitration procedure, the Government recalls that section  of the General Labour Act states that  any unscheduled stoppage of work in any enterprise by either employers or workers shall be prohibited until all means of conciliation and arbitration provided under the present title have been exhausted, otherwise the stoppage shall be deemed illegal'  The Government insists that the rule is clear in establishing the requirement of carrying out conciliation and arbitration. Given that the means of conciliation and arbitration provided in the abovementioned Act had not all been exhausted, the strike initiated by the COB was declared illegal in a ruling of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare, No. /, of  May .
.As regards the request made by the complainant to annul the wage deductions, the Government explains that these were applied on the grounds that the strike had been declared illegal and that the deductions applied to those who were not involved in the strike were reimbursed in subsequent wages. The Government also explains that the deductions were carried out before the hierarchical and administrative appeal process had been exhausted because the appeal lodged by the COB is regulated by the Act of Administrative Procedure No. , section  of which establishes that  the lodging of an appeal shall not suspend the execution of the contested ruling'  The regulation therefore expressly indicates that the deductions could not be suspended.
.The Government adds that the complainant does not provide documentary evidence of their allegations of criminal proceedings, the persecution of officials and the violation of trade union immunity, quite simply because they did not take place. The Government indicates that the complainant makes allegations but does not establish the identity of those who received gunshot bullet wounds or the link between the Government and reported searches and raids in their offices. The Government declares that police acted in response to the excesses which occurred during the street demonstrations, which involved the use of explosive materials capable of causing irreparable damage to human beings and material objects, and",-1,2013,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
13,"to the illegal measures taken by the union leadership. The Government indicates that the COB carried out and encouraged illegal actions against State property and internal security, such as the physical occupation of the Jorge Wilsterman International Airport in the city of Cochabamba, and calling for a police riot and the creation of a teachers' lobby group, and it even spread false news regarding a death in the Caihuasi blockade. The actions of the Bolivian authorities aimed to ensure the safety of the population that was not involved in the conflict, safeguard public and private property, and maintain public order, tranquillity and free movement throughout the national territory, all of which are responsibilities that the Political Constitution of the Bolivian State confers on the central Government. The Government explains that the police operated only in public spaces using anti-riot material and equipment which is routinely used by police forces worldwide.
.The Government points out that the COB alleges that internal regulations and ILO Conventions have been violated but it does not provide the names of the workers affected by those violations and it does not indicate how the State has violated ILO principles. It also adds that the COB has submitted previous complaints against the Government to the ILO, containing the same arguments but without providing concrete evidence of the way in which the Government appears to have violated ILO Conventions. Furthermore, the Government indicates that the COB s complaint makes no mention of the right that its officials are exercising to form a political party in opposition to the Government, known as the  Workers' Party'  which will presumably run in the national elections in . The Government indicates that although the State fully respects the exercise of that right, it knows that the COB expedited the general strike of May  in order to place that political party on the current electoral scene. The Government also indicates that the COB had not exhausted all national legal remedies before submitting its complaint to the ILO.
.Lastly, the Government indicates that, on  May , it sent a note to the COB containing a proposal for the resolution of the dispute. This was initially rejected and then, following further negotiations, the COB accepted the proposal on  September , when the collective agreement between the Government and the COB was signed, whereby both parties agreed to the amendment of the Act on Pensions, No. .
.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainant alleges that, in connection with a general strike involving public demonstrations over a two-week period in May  in defence of the list of claims which it had submitted and which included the amendment of the Act on Pensions, serious acts of violence were carried out against demonstrators, and union officials suffered illegal detentions, criminal proceedings and persecution, in violation of the right to strike and the rights enshrined in Convention No. . The complainant also reports that the strike was declared illegal by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare and that workers' wages were deducted on the basis of a declaration of illegality by a non-independent body.
.First, the Committee notes with interest that the Government reports that, on  September , the complainant and the Government resolved the dispute which gave rise to this case by signing a collective agreement in which both parties agreed to the amendment of the Act on Pensions, No. .
.Regarding the Government s claim that the strike by the COB was illegal, the Committee observes that the complainant and the Government hold differing points of view in this regard: while the Government claims that the complainant organization did not resort to the conciliation or arbitration measures provided in section  of the General Labour Act, and that said section clearly establishes the requirement of exhausting all conciliation and arbitration measures before a strike can be declared legal, the COB considers that recourse to arbitration ceased to be legally possible following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding. Regarding the fact that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare declared the strike illegal on  May , the Committee recalls that in a previous complaint against the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, which was submitted in  (see rd Report, paragraph ), it had examined similar allegations and recalled the principle according to which,  [R]esponsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved.' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the necessary measures, including proposals on legislative measures where necessary, to ensure that the responsibility for declaring a strike legal or illegal does not lie with the Government but with an independent and impartial body. The Committee also notes the appeal submitted by the complainant organization against Administrative Resolution No. - declaring the strike by the COB illegal. The Committee submits these issues to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Regarding the allegation that the wage deductions are illegal because they were carried out while the appeal was still pending against Administrative Resolution No. - declaring the strike by the COB illegal, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that wage deductions applied to those who were not involved in the strike were reimbursed and that the deductions were carried out while the appeal lodged by the COB was still pending because such appeals are regulated by the Act of Administrative Procedure No. , section  of which establishes that  the lodging of an appeal shall not suspend the execution of the contested ruling'  The Committee recalls that  [S]alary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards the allegations of serious acts of violence against demonstrators, illegal detentions, criminal proceedings and persecution against union officials, and the search of the home of one of the union officials in relation to the strike of May , the Committee notes that the Government indicates that: () some months before calling the general strike, COB officials created a political party in opposition to the Government, known as the  Workers' Party'  which will presumably run in the national elections in , suggesting that the strike in May  was politically motivated; () the police acted in response to the excesses which occurred during the street demonstrations, which involved the use of explosive materials capable of causing irreparable damage to human beings and material objects; illegal measures were also taken by the union leadership against State property and internal security, such as the physical occupation of the Jorge Wilsterman International Airport in the city of Cochabamba; () the police intervened to guarantee public order using anti-riot material and equipment which is routinely used by police forces worldwide; and () the complainant denounces but does not prove the serious acts of violence against protesters, illegal detentions, criminal proceedings or the persecution of union officials, neither does it establish a link between the Government and the reported searches, nor provide the names of the workers affected by those violations. As regards the political motivation for the strike referred to by the Government, the Committee indicates that, according to the complaint, the main reason for the strike was the reform of the Act on Pensions, which is a trade union concern, and which gave rise to negotiations that then led to a collective agreement. As regards the alleged detentions, criminal proceedings and other measures against trade union members, including the search of the home of a union member, although the Committee recalls the principle according to which  [N]o one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere fact of organizing or participating in a peaceful strike.' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. While the Committee regrets the acts of violence mentioned by the complainant and by the Government, it observes that the complainant has not communicated the names of the union members concerned, nor indicated whether they have filed complaints before the courts in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:While noting with interest that the dispute that gave rise to this case was resolved by the signing of a collective agreement between the Government and the complainant organization, the Committee again requests the Government to take the necessary measures, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that the responsibility for declaring a strike legal or illegal does not lie with the Government but with an independent and impartial body. Noting that the complainant organization lodged an appeal against Administrative Resolution No. - declaring the strike by the COB illegal, the Committee submits these issues to the attention of",-1,2013,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

15,".The Committee last examined this case, the allegations for which concerned the non-compliance by the National Health Fund (CNS) with a collective agreement and retaliation against trade unionists at its October  meeting [see rd Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to inform it urgently of the outcome of the proceedings initiated against two officials of the CNS National Legal Department and against the Fund s Administrative and Financial Manager for acting in excess of their authority in signing the collective agreement of  December .
.As part of the follow-up to the case, in a communication of  August , the Government states that, through Decision No. /, the legal action against the CNS Administrative and Financial Manager and the two officials of the CNS National Legal Department concerned for allegedly acting in excess of their authority was declared null and void, on the basis of Report No. / of  October  of the CNS National Legal Department. The Government specifies that the persons in question were acquitted of the charge of acting in excess of their authority since they had acted in line with special and sufficient authorization.
.Having duly noted that the proceedings initiated in relation to acting in excess of authority in the signing of a collective agreement had been dismissed, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  December  presented by the Federation of Medical Practitioners' Unions and Allied Branches of the National Health Fund (FESIMRAS). The complainant submitted fresh allegations in a communication of  February .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  May .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  December  and  February , FESIMRAS states that, in view of the unsatisfactory administration of the National Health Fund (CNS), it made representations seeking the regularization of administrative posts, improvement of the institution s infrastructure and respect for the social and economic rights of its members, and that, as a result of those representations, certain authorities of the CNS and the Government took steps to the detriment of its union officials and the trade union organization.
.More concretely, the complainant organization refers to the CNS Executive Board s Decision No. / of  September  stating that it was considering initiating criminal proceedings against the Executive Secretary and the Public Relations Secretary of FESIMRAS for defamation, which in the complainant s view marks the initiation of a plan to harass key union officials. The complainant appends the text of the decision, in which the General Manager is instructed to submit to the CNS National Legal Department the complainant s vote of Censure No. / of  August  (in which FESIMRAS characterizes the work of the Executive Board as unsatisfactory and highlights the economic harm it has caused the institution) for analysis and, on the basis of the outcome, to consider taking penal action against the FESIMRAS Executive Secretary and Public Relations Secretary for defamation.
.The complainant further alleges that the CNS Executive Board s Decision No. / of  September  contravenes the provisions of the collective agreement dated  December . According to that decision: () on  November , the CNS Executive Board issued Decision No. / by which it approved a regulation authorizing the direct hiring of contractors at the operational level for vacancies on the institution s regular payroll; () on  September , the Executive Board decided to apply said regulation and issued Decision No. / by which it authorized the hiring of contractors at the operational level for  vacancies on the institution s regular payroll; () subsequently, on  December , a collective agreement was signed by FESIMRAS and the CNS (represented by its Administrative and Financial Manager and two officials from the National Legal Department) ' which was approved by Ministerial Decision No. / of  January  ' establishing that the regulation approved by the Executive Board in Decision No. / (on the direct hiring of contractors at the operational level) would cease to apply in the CNS, and that the situation was consistent with Circular No. / issued by the General Management, the Administrative and Financial Management, the Healthcare Management and the National Human Resources Department, which cancelled the recruitment and selection processes conducted under said regulation; and () the Union of Medical Practitioners and Allied Branches of the CNS of La Paz informed the Regional Administrator of La Paz that the Executive Board s Decision No. / (on the direct hiring of contractors at the operational level) was null and void on account of the Ministerial Decision which approved the aforementioned collective agreement, and accordingly requested that the competitions in the hiring process for the contractors be declared null and void. It is noteworthy that the collective agreement in question contained only that clause. Notwithstanding the above, the complainant alleges that, almost a year after the collective agreement was signed, the CNS Executive Board issued Decision No. / (of  September ) approving the report of the Legal Commission of the CNS Executive Board, which instructed the General Management to take legal action against Mr Luis Rivas Michel, Administrative and Financial Manager of the CNS; Dr Abdn Ramiro Laora Blanco, lawyer in the National Legal Department of the CNS; and Dr Clotilde Bohrquez Flores of the National Legal Department of the CNS, for acting in excess of their authority by signing the collective agreement. The Executive Board s Decision No. / also states that Decision No. / on the direct hiring of contractors at the operational level to  vacant positions on the institution s regular payroll is in force.
.In addition to the aforementioned allegations, the complainant criticizes the fact that the Government s Supreme Decree No.  of  November , which approves a plan to restructure the CNS, includes an appendix containing a series of anti-union statements. The complainant encloses the text thereof, which states that trade union organizations are  factors which impede solutions for: financial matters, health coverage, results management, human resources management, improving outdated existing provisions of the institution, and compliance with public health policies'  In the complainant s view, the inclusion of said anti-union statements in an official regulation of the national Government represents discrimination, which is prohibited under the Bolivian Constitution and is contrary to the spirit of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.Lastly, in its communication of  February , the complainant presents fresh allegations of anti-union practices against its members. Specifically, the complainant refers to a financial penalty of a deduction of three days' wages for dereliction of duty imposed on: () union official Ms Silvia R. Villaroel, who enjoys union immunity and who, according to FESIMRAS, requested leave from her employer s most senior departmental authority to attend a meeting during work hours on  January ; and () Dr Dickson Stroebel Moreno, a former union official, for being absent from work without justification on Saturday,  January : according to FESIMRAS, he refused to work an additional six hours per week on Saturdays, as article  of the statutes of medical staff and public servants defines the working week in the sector as  hours, from Monday to Friday.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the complainant refers to the unsatisfactory administration of the CNS and to matters which concern the CNS s budgetary resources and the management and placement of the available human resources in the institution, all of which are administrative, not union, matters. The Government states that it fails to comprehend the complainant s basis for including in a labour-related complaint aspects which are within the sole administrative purview of the authorities of the CNS.
.As to the CNS Executive Board s Decision No. /, which orders a study into initiating penal action against the Executive Secretary and the Public Relations Secretary of FESIMRAS for defamation, the Government explains that that decision does not order the initiation of any immediate legal proceedings, but instead an analysis of the content of the FESIMRAS vote of Censure No. /, and that the appropriate action should be taken on the basis of the outcome of the analysis. The Government explains that the CNS Executive Board found in the FESIMRAS vote of Censure No. / indicia of the legal concept of defamation against its members, because it cast doubt on the professional capability and suitability of the members of the CNS Executive Board in the administration of the institution without any compelling evidence. Nevertheless, the Government states that legal report No.  of  January , drafted by the CNS Legal Department, concluded that the CNS could not take any legal action against the FESIMRAS union officials as a result of vote of Censure No. /, because it",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
16,"impugns a legally protected interest attached to a  natural person and which is strictly personal in nature; it in no way affects the legally protected interest of the entity'  Accordingly, it concluded that initiating legal proceedings against FESIMRAS or its officials for the aforementioned vote of censure would be inappropriate.
.As to the allegation that the CNS Executive Board s Decision No. / contravenes the provisions of the collective agreement of  December , the Government states that the subject matter of the negotiations had been decided on three months before the collective agreement was signed, specifically by means of the CNS Executive Board s Decision No. /, which had approved the hiring of contractors for  vacant operational posts.
.As to the complainant s allegation that the appendix to the Government s Supreme Decree No.  approving the plan to restructure the CNS contains anti-union statements, the Government notes that trade union officials at the CNS had regrettably been broaching subjects unrelated to representing and defending the occupational interests of the workers for several years, and had been exerting pressure and making various threats when intervening in subjects of an administrative, management and executive nature, which are within the sole competency of the authorities of the CNS.
.Lastly, with regard to the additional allegations submitted by the complainant in its communication of  February  on the financial penalties imposed on union official Ms Silvia R. Villaroel and former union official Dr Dickson Stroebel, the Government recalls the legal obligation to seek written authorization for absences from the workplace and to obtain the express permission of the competent authority of the employer institution to leave. In Ms Silvia R. Villaroel s case, the Government notes that none of the documents appended by the complainant organization shows a written request from her to be absent from the workplace for the purpose of carrying out union activities nor do they include the requisite written authorization from the employer to the worker. With regard to Dr Dickson Stroebel Moreno, the Government states that his being Vice-President of his department s College of Medicine does not exempt him from the legal obligation to seek written authorization to be absent from the workplace and to obtain express permission to leave from the competent authority of the institution in which he works.
.For all these reasons, the Government denies any breach of ILO Conventions Nos  and .
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant alleges: () that the Executive Board of the National Health Fund (CNS) threatened to take penal action against the Executive Secretary and the Public Relations Secretary of FESIMRAS for defamation; () that Decision No. / by which the CNS Executive Board authorized the direct hiring of hundreds of contractual workers for vacant operational posts under the regular payroll of the institution contravenes the provisions of the collective agreement of  December ; () that the Government s Supreme Decree No.  approving the plan to restructure the CNS includes an appendix containing a series of anti-union statements; and () that anti-union financial penalties were imposed on union official Ms Silvia R Villaroel and former union official Dr Dickson Stroebel Moreno.
.As to the allegation that the CNS Executive Board issued a decision (No. /) ordering a study into taking penal action against the Executive Secretary and the Public Relations Secretary of FESIMRAS for defamation, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that: () in circumstances where the complainant organization complained of matters concerning the CNS s budget and the management of human resources in the institution ' both of which are administrative, not union, matters ' the complainant organization issued vote of Censure No. / against the CNS Executive Board  for its unsatisfactory work and the economic harm caused to the institution'  () the CNS Executive Board found in FESIMRAS s vote of censure indicia of the legal concept of defamation against its members, since the vote cast doubt on the professional capability and suitability of the members of the CNS Executive Board in the administration of the institution without any compelling evidence, and the Board ordered a study of the content of the vote of censure and, depending on the outcome, the initiation of appropriate action; () however, the CNS Legal Department s Report No.  dated  January  concluded that the CNS could not take penal action against the FESIMRAS union officials for defamation on the basis of vote of Censure No. / because the vote impugns a legally protected interest attached to a  natural person and which is strictly personal in nature; it in no way affects the legally protected interest of the entity'  The Committee recalls that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas, and to this end workers, employers and their organizations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. Nevertheless, in expressing their opinion, trade union organizations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee emphasizes in this regard that the authorities' threatening to press criminal charges in response to legitimate opinions of trade union representatives may have an intimidating and detrimental effect on the exercise of trade union rights. However, the Committee observes that the authorities ultimately followed the CNS Legal Department s recommendations and decided not to press any criminal charges against FESIMRAS or its officials for the aforementioned vote of censure. Accordingly, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this matter, and expects full observance of this principle.
.As to the alleged failure to comply with the collective agreement signed by FESIMRAS and the CNS on  December , which establishes that the regulation dated  November  authorizing the direct hiring of contractual workers for vacant operational posts on the institution s regular payroll cannot be applied in the CNS, the complainant states that, almost one year after the collective agreement was signed, the CNS Executive Board issued Decision No. /, reiterating the provisions of Decision No. / and confirming the direct hiring of contractors for  vacant operational posts on the regular payroll; furthermore, that decision instructs the General Management to take legal action against the Administrative and Financial Manager and two officials of the National Legal Department for acting in excess of their authority by signing the collective agreement. The Committee notes that the Government denies the alleged failure to comply with the collective agreement and states that the Executive Board had issued Decision No. / and authorized the hiring of contractors for  vacant operational posts three months before the collective agreement was signed. The Committee notes with regret the lack of coordination between the CNS Executive Board and the persons representing the CNS at the signing of the collective agreement ' that is, the Administrative and Financial Manager and two officials from the National Legal Department of the CNS ' and requests the Government to inform it urgently of the outcome of the proceedings initiated against them for acting in excess or abuse of their authority by signing the collective agreement. In such circumstances, the Committee is mindful of the practical difficulty, owing to the years which have passed, of reneging on the appointment of  contractors to vacant posts on the regular payroll. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls in general the principle that  [m]utual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on stable and firm ground' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and firmly expects that no situations of this nature will arise in the future.
.As to the allegation that the Government s Supreme Decree No.  approving the plan to restructure the CNS includes an appendix containing a series of anti-union statements, the Committee observes that the complainant has enclosed the text of the Decree, the appendix to which states that  trade union organizations are factors which impede solutions for: financial matters, health coverage, results management, human resources management, improving outdated existing provisions of the institution, and compliance with public health policies of the National Health Fund'  The Committee notes that the Government states that trade union officials at the CNS had regrettably been broaching subjects unrelated to representing and defending the occupational interests of the workers for several years, and had been exerting pressure and making various threats when intervening in subjects of an administrative, management and executive nature, which are within the sole competency of the authorities of the CNS. While considering debate and criticism between social partners as legitimate, the Committee regrets that the authorities of the CNS made declarations annexed to a Decree concerning its view of the role of trade union organizations,",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
17,"which are contrary to a constructive spirit of social dialogue and collective bargaining. The Committee recalls the importance it attaches to mutual respect between the parties and to the promotion of dialogue and consultation on questions of mutual interest between the public authorities and the most representative occupational organizations of the sector involved [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and expects that in the future the authorities of the CNS and the FESIMRAS will refrain from making statements which do not contribute to mutual respect or the harmonious development of labour relations.
.Lastly, concerning the penalty of a deduction of three days' salary imposed on union official Ms Silvia R. Villaroel, the Committee observes that, while the complainant organization alleges that the official requested permission from the highest departmental authority of the employer institution to attend a meeting during work time on  January , the Government emphasizes that there is no documentary evidence that the official requested written authorization for time off from work to carry out union activities nor is there evidence of the written authorization which the employer was obliged to provide. The Committee observes that the penalty appears to be founded on Supreme Decree No.  (appended by the complainant), which provides that union officials who are not on union leave must request authorization from their employer to absent themselves temporarily from their work in order to carry out activities within their mandate and that the employer must grant them the requisite leave for the time requested. The Committee recalls that, when examining an allegation concerning the denial of time off to participate in trade union meetings, it has recalled that,  while account should be taken of the characteristics of the industrial relations system of the country, and while the granting of such facilities should not impair the efficient operation of the undertaking concerned, Paragraph , subparagraph , of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), provides that workers' representatives in the undertaking should be afforded the necessary time off from work, without loss of pay or social and fringe benefits, for carrying out their representation functions. Subparagraph  of Paragraph  also specifies that, while workers' representatives may be required to obtain permission from the management before taking time off, such permission should not be unreasonably withheld' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In such circumstances, in the absence of any evidence that the official in question requested written permission for time off from work in order to carry out trade union activities, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.Regarding the penalty of the deduction of three days' salary imposed on former union official Dr Dickson Stroebel, the Committee observes that, according to the allegations, the reason why he did not request written permission for time off from work on Saturday,  January  is that he did not agree to a six-hour increase in his weekly working time (on Saturdays) when the statutes of medical staff and public servants define the working week in the sector as  hours,  from Monday to Friday'  The Committee notes that the Government states that his being Vice-President of the College of Medicine of his department does not exempt him from the legal obligation to request written authorization to be absent from the workplace and to obtain express permission to leave from the competent authority of the institution in which he works. The Committee observes that Dr Dickson Stroebel was not a union official at the time of the alleged events, that his absence from work is unrelated to the exercise of duties within the complainant organization but instead relates to duties within the College of Medicine, and that he did not request authorization to leave work as stipulated by law. Accordingly, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to inform it urgently of the outcome of the proceedings initiated against the National Health Fund s Administrative and Financial Manager and two officials of its Legal Department for acting in excess of their authority in signing the collective agreement dated  December .",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
18,".The Trade Union Confederation of Construction Workers of Bolivia (CSTCB) presented its complaint in a communication of  November .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  June .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the CSTCB states that, on  January , the Union of Municipal Public Works of the Municipality of Cercado Province in Cochabamba Department presented a list of demands containing  points, and on  October  it presented a modified list containing three points on which it had not been possible to reach agreement. Against this background, a conciliation board was set up and, as agreement could not be reached, an arbitration tribunal was convened.
.The complainant organization adds that the tribunal issued an award in  ordering the provision of a meal allowance, seniority bonuses based on the institutional base salary and performance incentives. It also indicates that, as the Municipality had not demonstrated its willingness to give effect to the arbitration award, it had sought assistance in that regard from the judicial authority (the Third Labour and Social Welfare Court of Cochabamba), which repeatedly ordered the enforcement of the award. The complainant organization reports that, between July  and October , the Municipality lodged a series of appeals, which were rejected.
.The complainant organization states that, on  October , the Third Labour and Social Welfare Court of Cochabamba ultimately granted a reasonable period of time as requested by the Municipality for the purpose of making the individual payments, but that after the period of  days the payments in question had not been made. The complainant organization adds that the union nevertheless engaged in talks with the municipal authorities and a preliminary agreement on the enforcement of the arbitration award was drafted, but the municipal authorities did not sign it and they lodged further appeals between May and July , which were also rejected. The complainant organization states that, on  July , after lodging the aforementioned appeals, the Municipality filed an application for amparo (protection of constitutional rights), requesting that the decisions of the labour courts be overturned. On  November , the application filed by the Municipality was accepted and the complainant organization brought the matter before the Plurinational Constitutional Court, calling for action in accordance with the law and for the protection of the consolidated rights of workers in accordance with the rights they have acquired under various awards and agreements.
.The CSTCB indicates that, in the light of numerous delays caused by an abuse of the appeals process and the broken promise to sign the preliminary agreement on the enforcement of the arbitration award, on  July  union members staged a sit-down strike under the provisions of article  of the Bolivian Constitution. The complainant organization alleges that the Municipality penalized those involved in this action by docking them a day s pay, but that the Departmental Labour Office ordered that the amount be reimbursed. The complainant organization adds that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare stated that it is not in a position to issue a ruling regarding the pay that was docked as a penalty for participation in the sit-down strike, and on the grounds that the right to strike is prohibited for the municipal sector under the provisions of section  of the General Labour Act, it issued Ministerial Resolution No.  of  April , cancelling the order to reimburse the docked pay. Lastly, the complainant organization states that, at the time of presenting its complaint, there had been no specific outcome concerning the legal enforceability of the arbitration award in favour of the union and the workers who have suffered as a result of the Ministry of Labour s action undermining the right to strike (the complainant organization points out that, although the new Bolivian Constitution recognizes the right to strike in its article , this progressive notion of the right to strike is yet to be reflected in the General Labour Act ' which dates back to  and which contains anachronistic elements that run counter to the universally and constitutionally recognized right to strike ' and in Supreme Decree No.  of  March , which restricts the right to strike in the public, fiscal and municipal administration, even though these are not specific and essential sectors).
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that the political and institutional structure of the Bolivian State is based on full respect for the independence of the bodies and branches of government and their respective competences, as well as on institutional autonomy. In this regard, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare, with a view to carrying out the duties set out in section  of Supreme Decree No. , received the list of demands in accordance with the procedure established by the General Labour Act, the Regulatory Decree and the Code of Labour Procedure at the time of convening the arbitration tribunal, which issued the arbitration award of  November  and subsequently the award of  May  and in which employers, workers and the Government were represented.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare, in accordance with the labour regulations and administrative rules in force, determined in relation to the strike staged by the Union of Municipal Public Works of the Municipality of Cercado Province in Cochabamba Department, through Ministerial Resolution No. / of  April , that: () the implementation of the arbitration award is not an administrative matter, which is why it cannot issue a ruling on the appropriateness of the decision by the Autonomous Municipal Government of Cochabamba to dock pay for strike action; () section  of Supreme Decree No.  of  March  prohibits the suspension of work in public services, in the form of a strike, lockout or other means; and () the order dated  November  was notified after the deadline established in paragraph III of Act No. , which is evidence to implicate, on grounds of responsibility for the public service, the former Chief of Cochabamba s Labour Department.
.The Government states that the reasons outlined above supported the reversal of the administrative decisions providing for the reimbursement of wages for the day not worked, and the referral of the case to the investigating authority for the purposes of determining the existence or not of evidence of public service responsibility. In this regard, these actions were taken in compliance with the powers granted by the Constitution and other lower-ranking standards, as they were necessary to resolve the legal issue raised by the union. As to the alleged lack of timely and effective protection by the judicial system, the Government states that it is up to the judicial branch to decide on this issue, since it is responsible for exercising ordinary jurisdiction, as established by article () of the Constitution.
.The Government indicates, with regard to the alleged incompatibility between the Constitution on the one hand and Supreme Decree No.  of  March  and the General Labour Act on the other, concerning the right to strike, that article  of the Code of Constitutional Procedure provides that any standard adopted by a State organ at any level is presumed to be constitutional, unless the Plurinational Constitutional Court deems otherwise. The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare must comply with the rules in force under the principle of legality.
.The Government concludes that: () the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare followed the established procedures regarding the handling of the list of demands presented by the union and applied the principle of legality with regard to the work stoppage arising from the arbitration award of  May ; () the judicial branch, which is responsible for exercising ordinary jurisdiction, shall issue a ruling on the CSTCB s complaint regarding the lack of timely and effective protection by the judicial system; () as to the alleged incompatibility of the General Labour Act and Supreme Decree No.  of  March  with the Constitution, it is the responsibility of the Constitutional Court to issue a ruling in strict compliance with article  of the Code of Constitutional Procedure; and () the Government has not violated any international convention or national law concerning freedom of association.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges the failure to give effect to an award issued in  by an arbitration tribunal concerning three points on a list of demands presented in January  by the Union of Municipal Public Works of the Municipality of Cercado Province in Cochabamba Department and objects to a decision by the Municipality to dock a day s pay from the workers for staging a sit-down strike in response to an abuse of the appeals process and",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
19,"to a broken promise by the municipal authorities to sign a preliminary agreement on the enforcement of the arbitration award.
.With regard to the alleged failure to give effect to an award issued in  by an arbitration tribunal concerning three points on a list of demands presented in January  by the Union of Municipal Public Works of the Municipality of Cercado Province in Cochabamba Department (the complainant organization indicates that, although the Third Labour and Social Welfare Court of Cochabamba repeatedly ordered the enforcement of the arbitration award, the municipal authorities refused to do this and between July  and October  lodged a series of appeals, which were rejected; and they participated in talks at which a preliminary agreement on the enforcement of the arbitration award was drafted, but ultimately they did not sign it), the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () the political and institutional structure of the Bolivian State is based on full respect for the independence of the bodies and branches of government and their respective competences, as well as on institutional autonomy; () in this regard, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare, with a view to carrying out the duties set out in section  of Supreme Decree No. , received the list of demands in accordance with the procedure established by the General Labour Act, the Regulatory Decree and the Code of Labour Procedure at the time of convening the arbitration tribunal, which issued the arbitration award of  November  and subsequently the award of  May  and in which employers, workers and the Government were represented; and () the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare followed the established procedures regarding the handling of the list of demands presented by the union.
.In this respect, the Committee regrets that such a long time has elapsed (more than eight years since the start of the dispute relating to certain points on a list of demands) without a solution being found to some of the issues raised by the union on a list of demands (even when the judicial authority ordered the enforcement of an arbitration award on the matter) and observes that an application for amparo on the matter, filed by the Municipality, is still pending before the Constitutional Court. Under these circumstances, while recalling the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], the Committee expects that the Constitutional Court will hand down a ruling in the very near future regarding the arbitration tribunal s award concerning the list of demands by the Union of Municipal Public Works of the Municipality of Cercado Province in Cochabamba Department. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the contested decision by the Municipality to dock a day s pay from workers for staging a sit-down strike in response to an abuse of the appeals process following an award by the arbitration tribunal concerning the list of demands presented by the union and in the light of the broken promise by the municipal authorities to sign a preliminary agreement on the enforcement of the arbitration award, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government: () the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare, in accordance with the labour regulations and administrative rules in force, determined in relation to the strike staged by the Union of Municipal Public Works of the Municipality of Cercado Province in Cochabamba Department, through Ministerial Resolution No. / of  April , that: (i) the implementation of the arbitration award is not an administrative matter, which is why it cannot issue a ruling on the appropriateness of the decision by the Autonomous Municipal Government of Cochabamba to dock pay for strike action; (ii) section  of Supreme Decree No.  of  March  prohibits the suspension of work in public services, in the form of a strike, lockout or other means; and (iii) the order dated  November  was notified after the deadline established in paragraph III of Act No. , which is evidence to implicate, on grounds of responsibility for the public service, the former Chief of Cochabamba s Labour Department; () the reasons outlined above supported the reversal of the administrative decisions providing for the reimbursement of wages for the day not worked, and the referral of the case to the investigating authority for the purposes of determining the existence or not of evidence of public service responsibility; and () in this regard, these actions were taken in compliance with the powers granted by the Constitution and other lower-ranking standards, as they were necessary to resolve the legal issue raised by the union. In this regard, the Committee recalls that it has emphasized on several occasions that  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Under these circumstances and taking into account the information that has been communicated, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of these allegations.
.With regard to the allegations that, although the new Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia recognizes the right to strike in its article , the General Labour Act, which dates back to , contains anachronistic elements that run counter to the universally and constitutionally recognized right to strike, and Supreme Decree No.  of  March  restricts the right to strike in the public, fiscal and municipal administration, even though these are not specific and essential sectors, the Committee notes that, according to the Government: () with regard to the alleged incompatibility between the Constitution on the one hand and Supreme Decree No.  of  March  and the General Labour Act on the other, concerning the right to strike, article  of the Code of Constitutional Procedure provides that any standard adopted by a State organ at any level is presumed to be constitutional, unless the Plurinational Constitutional Court deems otherwise; and () the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Welfare must comply with the rules in force under the principle of legality. In this regard, the Committee observes that section (a) of Supreme Decree No.  of , which is contested by the complainant organization, provides that public, fiscal and municipal administration services are among those considered to be public services, where the suspension of work is prohibited. In this respect, the Committee recalls that, on numerous occasions, it has indicated that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited: () in the public service only for public servants exercising authority in the name of the State; () in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population); and () in the event of an acute national emergency [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee considers that municipal workers, other than those who provide essential services in the strict sense of the term, are not included in the abovementioned categories and therefore should be able to exercise the right to strike. While observing that the Government has informed the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) that in follow-up to the adoption of the new Constitution it has initiated a legislative reform [see  Report of the CEACR, observations on the application of Conventions Nos  and ], the Committee expects that all the necessary measures will be taken to modify or amend Supreme Decree No.  of  in order to bring it into full conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations, the Committee expects that the Constitutional Court will hand down a ruling in the very near future regarding the arbitration tribunal s award concerning the list of demands by the Union of Municipal Public Works of the Municipality of Cercado Province in Cochabamba Department. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee expects that all the necessary measures will be taken to modify or amend Supreme Decree No.  of  in order to bring it into full conformity with the principles of freedom of association enunciated in its conclusions.",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
20,".The complaint is contained in communications from the Federation of Medical Practitioners' Unions and Allied Branches of the National Health Fund (FESIMRAS) dated  April and  May . The FESIMRAS of the Oil Workers Health Fund forwarded allegations related to the complaint in a communication dated  June . Furthermore, the FESIMRAS sent additional information in a communication dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  April,  May and  July , the FESIMRAS states that the Government adopted Supreme Decree No.  on  January , increasing the working day of health professionals and workers. The complainant organization adds that the decree s corresponding regulations (RM No. ) were issued on  March  and confirms that the increase in working hours will not be commensurately and proportionately remunerated. The FESIMRAS considers that the supreme decree in question and its regulations constitute a direct violation of a right acquired under all pre-existing employment contracts and run counter to the constitutional mandate, which provides that acquired rights are inviolable. The complainant organization states that it lodged an appeal to revoke the decree, but that it received no reply from the Government, and that it also requested the National Health Fund (CNS) not to implement the decree.
.The complainant organization states that, in view of the lack of State mechanisms to which it could turn for help in seeking a solution to the violation of employment and constitutional rights, it was forced to hold a series of protest marches and work stoppages (a -hour work stoppage on  March; a -hour work stoppage on  and  March; and a strike that lasted from  March to  April , when a truce was signed with the Ministry of Health and Sports). The complainant organization adds that the Ministry of Health and Sports failed to comply with the truce and therefore the Medical Association of the Plurinational State of Bolivia called for an indefinite general work stoppage as from  April , seeking to have Supreme Decree No.  revoked. The complainant organization alleges that, in response to these actions, the administrative authority, acting both as judge and party, declared the work stoppages and strike illegal. It also alleges that on  April  the Ministry of Health began signing the first dismissal notifications. In the complainant s view, declaring the strikes illegal and acts of intimidation and persecution involving the dismissal of union members who took part in the work stoppages constitute violations of freedom of association. The FESIMRAS of the Oil Workers Health Fund refers to the same issues in its communication of  June .
.In its communication of  July , the FESIMRAS reports that a temporary solution was found to the change in the working day (the FESIMRAS provides a copy of a decree suspending and holding off implementation of Supreme Decree No.  until after the National Summit for the Revolution of Public and Free Health Care, during which all stakeholders will analyse, discuss and agree on a new national health system). The FESIMRAS also provides a copy of the inter-agency agreement between the Ministry of the Interior and the National Health Commission (signed, inter alia, by the FESIMRAS), according to which: Professionals from the national health system and the public social security system who had been dismissed for the protest marches that led to the agreement will be reinstated in their posts immediately, thereby revoking the dismissal notifications and safeguarding respect for their employment rights and guarantees; and that, after signing this agreement, the national Government is committed to refraining from instituting or continuing legal proceedings against union leaders, rank-and-file members, professionals and administrative staff who took part in the protests against Supreme Decree No. . Lastly, the FESIMRAS alleges that no solution was found regarding the exercise of the right to strike in the health sector, which continues to be restricted.
.In its communication of  September , the Government first states that, it appears from its analysis of the complaint that during the strike held by doctors and health workers of the Plurinational State of Bolivia in April and May , the Government in no way violated the trade union immunity or trade union rights of the leaders of the complainant federation. According to the Government, neither the provisions of ILO Conventions Nos  and  nor national regulations for the protection of trade union immunity have been violated.
.The Government states that, following the work stoppages and strikes called for in the health sector, the Ministry of Health and Sports requested the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to declare them illegal, by taking appropriate legal action, in view of the perceived failure to comply with the relevant regulations on calling a strike. In this respect, and in the strict implementation of the regulations referred to in article (II) of the Constitution, which states that health services shall be provided without interruption (in accordance with the provisions of article  of the General Labour Act, prohibiting the suspension of work in public services, and the provisions of article (d) of Supreme Decree No.  of  March , prohibiting strikes in public services), the aforementioned strikes were declared illegal through the respective administrative rulings of the Directorate of Labour and Occupational Health and Safety. The Government adds that the FESIMRAS lodged appeals against the aforementioned rulings, as the law provides, and that these were rejected, thereby confirming that the strikes could be declared illegal.
.The Government also states that, despite the foregoing, during the dispute the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the Ministry of Health and Sports in particular opened negotiation channels and spaces, not only with the health workers' unions and medical practitioners' professional associations of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, but also with the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, as the most effective way to find a satisfactory solution for the workers and end-users of public health services. As a result of those negotiations and as illustrated in the documents that the FESIMRAS itself sent to the ILO, the Government decided to suspend implementation of Supreme Decree No.  concerning an eight-hour working day in the health sector pending agreement of a health-care package deal. In this regard, it was agreed to hold a National Summit for the Revolution of Public and Free Health Care, the agenda, programme of work, date and venue of which are being coordinated by the Government, the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, health workers' unions, medical professionals and the Executive Board of the Bolivian University. The Government adds that this summit will aim to develop a new health policy, taking into account the interests and needs of Bolivian health service union members, and to find short-, medium- and long-term solutions to all the challenges facing the health sector in the Plurinational State of Bolivia. The summit is planned for the final quarter of this year. The Government further emphasizes that, as a result of the agreement, the dismissal notifications were also revoked and a procedure to provide compensation for days not worked during the dispute was established by mutual agreement.
.The Government states that it is evident that the rights of the workers, let alone those of the union leaders, have not been violated, given that declaring the strikes called for by the FESIMRAS illegal was permitted in law; thus, there has been no violation of trade union immunity or existing national labour standards.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that, following the adoption of Supreme Decree No.  amending the working day of health professionals and workers, work stoppages and strikes were held, which were declared illegal by the administrative authority (the complainant organization objects to the restrictions on the right to strike in the health sector and to the fact that the administrative authority declared the industrial action illegal) and that many workers in the sector were subsequently dismissed.
.In this respect, the Committee notes first with interest that the complainant organization and the Government provide a copy of an inter-agency agreement between the Ministry of the Interior and the National Health Commission (signed, inter alia, by the FESIMRAS), according to which: Professionals from the national health system and the public social security system who had been dismissed for the protest marches that led to the agreement will be reinstated in their posts immediately, thereby revoking the dismissal notifications and safeguarding respect for their employment rights and guarantees; and that, after signing this agreement, the national Government is committed to refraining from instituting or continuing legal proceedings against union leaders, rank-and-file members, professionals and administrative staff who took part in the protests against Supreme Decree No. . The Committee also duly notes that the Government and the complainant organization provide a",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
21,"copy of a decree suspending and holding off implementation of Supreme Decree No.  (which was the root cause of the dispute in this case) until after the National Summit for the Revolution of Public and Free Health Care, during which all stakeholders will analyse, discuss and agree on a new national health system. Under these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.Finally, as regards the allegations that the right to strike continues to be restricted in the health sector, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that national legislation prohibits strikes in the health sector. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ] and deems that the health sector may be considered as an essential service. However, the Committee wishes to recall that  where the right to strike is restricted or prohibited in certain essential undertakings or services, adequate protection should be given to the workers to compensate for the limitation thereby placed on their freedom of action with regard to disputes affecting such undertakings and services' and that  as regards the nature of  ppropriate guarantees' in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, restrictions on the right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented' [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, while recalling that in cases where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services and the public service, these restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration proceedings, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
22,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see rd Report, paras ' ]:(a)	The Committee invites the COB to send to the authorities the names of the persons who were assaulted, injured or taken into custody during the general strike and demonstrations held in April  so that the Government can conduct an investigation without delay to determine responsibilities and, should excessive force prove to have been used, so that the perpetrators can be punished.(b)	The Committee expects that once the objections regarding non-compliance with the regulations of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz have been settled, the decision will be issued, if appropriate, establishing the union leave entitlement of the union officers concerned.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the deducted pay is refunded without delay to those National CNS workers who did not take part in the strike of April . Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal does not lie with the Government but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved, and to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal filed by FENSEGURAL against Ministerial Decision No.  whereby the strike in the sector was declared illegal.(d)	With regard to the alleged dismissal of union officer Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez from the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that an investigation is conducted into the grounds for the dismissal and to keep it informed of the outcome.(e)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure the implementation of the order for the reinstatement of union officers Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova at the Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda enterprise.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure the implementation of the order for the reinstatement of union officers Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina at the Novara SRL enterprise and to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) reportedly filed by the persons affected.
.In a communication dated  September , the Government states the following with regard to the Committee s recommendations:' With regard to recommendation (a), it is for the COB to send its observations on the matter. The Committee takes note of this information and once again requests the COB to send to the authorities the names of the persons who were assaulted, injured or taken into custody during the general strike and demonstrations held in April  so that the Government can conduct an investigation without delay to determine responsibilities and, should excessive force prove to have been used, so that the perpetrators can be punished. In the event that the relevant information is not sent, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of these allegations.' With regard to recommendation (b), the request for recognition of, and granting of union leave entitlement to, the executive committee of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz, headed by Mr Mario Vidal Ojeda, has been brought to the attention of its parent body, the COB, led by Mr Juan Carlos Trujillo, and its entire executive committee, which is in the process of resolving the internal dispute, claims and other issues of its member organization. Once these internal matters have been dealt with and the COB has communicated the results of its own internal actions, the relevant ministry will proceed to issue the appropriate ministerial decision. The Committee takes note of this information and expects that, once the objections regarding non-compliance with the regulations of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz have been settled, the decision will be issued, if appropriate, establishing the union leave entitlement of the union officers concerned.' With regard to the first part of recommendation (c), the general management of the CNS has sent note No.  of  August , in which it reports that, in May , the deductions made from those workers who could produce documentation to demonstrate that they had worked on the days when the dispute occurred were reimbursed. With regard to the second part, the preliminary draft of the new General Labour Act is planned to include procedures and conditions for declaring strikes illegal. Lastly, in connection with the appeal lodged by FENSEGURAL against administrative decision No. , it should be reported that, by means of administrative decision No. - of  May , the appeal was rejected and all the provisions of administrative decision No.  were upheld. The Committee takes note of this information and trusts that the amendments to the General Labour Act will take account of the fact that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the Government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved.' With regard to recommendation (d), the Departmental Labour Office for La Paz reports that, according to verification activities carried out by the labour inspection services, Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez submitted her letter of resignation to the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos enterprise voluntarily. The amounts corresponding to her social benefits were deposited with the holding unit of the Departmental Labour Office for La Paz. This amount was paid by cheque to the former worker and beneficiary in May , thereby ending the employment relationship between the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos enterprise and Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez. The Committee takes note of this information.' With regard to recommendation (e), the Departmental Labour Office for La Paz has reported that, according to report No. V/, prepared by the labour inspection services, Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova was reinstated in his post on  February , while Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta was paid his social benefits. The Committee takes note with satisfaction of the reinstatement of Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova. However, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the reasons why Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta has not been reinstated in his post, as requested.' With respect to recommendation (f), the amparo proceedings have been before the Civil Chamber of the Higher Court for District No.  since  December . The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee once more requests the Government to ensure the implementation of its own order for the reinstatement of union officers Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina at the Novara SRL enterprise. With regard to the amparo claim brought by the union officers in question, the Committee regrets that such a long time has passed without a ruling being handed down in this regard by the courts. The Committee recalls that  justice delayed is justice denied' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ] and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these amparo proceedings.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB) and the National Federation of Social Security Workers of Bolivia (FENSEGURAL) and in a communication dated  June  from the Departmental Federation of Industrial Workers of La Paz (FDTFLP). The COB sent additional information in a communication dated  July .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July,  September and  November .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB) states that because of the Government s lack of response to its demands it organized a protest march from the town of Caracollo to La Paz. On  May  the COB, in conjunction with the mobilized union members, had reached an agreement with the Government in the town of Panduro to engage in direct negotiations with a view to settling the collective dispute with the Government. Subsequently, direct negotiations were opened in accordance with the procedure established by the labour legislation, in particular section  et seq. of the General Labour Act, and this resulted in the signature of a collective agreement, thereby ending the dispute. One of the points in the collective agreement states that the Government undertakes to promote labour standards in consensus with the COB.
.The COB indicates that, in the above context and in accordance with the Panduro agreement, the negotiation board was set up in February  with a view to considering the confederation s demands for , including with regard to a pay increase, the revival of production, the repeal of Supreme Decree No. , the General Labour Act and trade union immunity. The COB adds that, after reaching an intermediate stage in the negotiations and expressly requesting the Government to observe the consensus established in the Panduro agreement",-1,2011,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
23,"whereby it would not take any decisions on pay increases without the agreement of the confederation, the Government violated the agreement and promulgated Supreme Decree No.  of  March , which establishes a paltry wage increase of  per cent for only two sectors (health and education), showing blatant discrimination against all other workers and totally failing to comply with the Panduro agreement.
.In view of this outrageous failure of the Government to show integrity towards the workers and observe the Panduro agreement, the COB decided in April  on the gradual mobilization of all workers in the direction of La Paz. After  days of protest marches, the Government agreed to meet the COB and on  April  a new eight-point agreement was signed at the Office of the Vice-President of the Plurinational State, after more than  hours of negotiations.
.The COB states that, in view of the Government s failure to observe the Panduro agreement, it was totally lawful to declare the strike. The COB thus declared an indefinite general strike, which obliged the President to hold meetings for more than  hours in order to reach a new agreement.
.According to the COB, during the demonstrations the country s workers were the victims of brutal repression by the repressive apparatus of the State, in the form of detention, criminal trials and harassment. Trade union immunity and the most basic human rights were violated, since the workers (men and women) were the target of aggression and beatings, gunfire and tear gas, all involving pre-meditated brutality and malice. The COB alleges repression, harassment, detentions and beatings of workers, such as occurred against rural teachers in La Apacheta, and beatings and detentions of workers (men and women) in La Paz and other cities in the country. The COB declares that these acts cannot go unpunished.
.The COB indicates that on  April , continuing the direct negotiation procedure, an agreement was signed at the Office of the Vice-President of the Plurinational State which incorporated the following eight points: () an  per cent pay increase made retroactive to January , with a further  per cent as from August ; () the repeal of Supreme Decree No.  as from  May ; () revival of the apparatus of production; () restructuring of the National Health Fund (CNS); () revision of Act No.  and Act No.  as from  April  (not complied with); () respect for trade union immunity; () observance of the Panduro agreements; and () keeping the COB informed with regard to food security and stability and accessibility of food prices.
.The COB alleges that the new agreement of  April  with the Government was not honoured either, since Supreme Decree No.  of  May  was not repealed; rather, the Government tried to dupe the COB with a speech in which it announced the  elimination' of any legal provision deriving from Supreme Decree No. , which is not the same as repealing that Decree. According to the COB, the Government also failed to implement the  per cent pay increase with retroactive effect to January  and instead proceeded to dismiss workers and deduct pay for strike days from teachers, CNS workers and public health workers. In addition, it adopted Criminal Supreme Decree No.  as in the times of dictatorship and neo-liberalism, using its absolute power. This was an act of revenge, and it was alleged that the strike was illegal, when it was quite clear that the strike was legal because of the Government s own failure to honour the Panduro agreement. Furthermore, the Government s abuse and arrogance reaches its height in the blatant violation of all the labour legislation and particularly Supreme Decree No.  of  July , which states that deductions from pay must serve the workers themselves in the cultural and social activities of the organizations to which they belong, but the Government used the pay deductions as it saw fit, confiscating and appropriating them for its own political purposes.
.The COB considers that it has fulfilled the requirements of section  et seq. of the General Labour Act and also article  et seq. of the Political Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia (Political Constitution), which establishes the right to strike, and finds that the Government has violated the ILO Conventions relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining through its failure to honour the Panduro agreements, with the promulgation of Supreme Decree No.  and Supreme Decree No. , arbitrary and illegal misuse of deductions from pay, criminal trials and harassment of union officers.
.In its communication of  July, the COB points out that the ministries responsible for the treasury, labour, health and education continue to dock pay in an arbitrary and illegal manner from workers who took part in the strike and that the summary proceedings against them are still in progress. Harassment of union officers has escalated as a result of interference from the Government, which, through the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security (Ministry of Labour), refuses to issue ministerial decisions establishing the right of elected union officers to take trade union leave, as provided for by the General Labour Act. Specifically, the COB makes the following allegations: () failure to issue the ministerial decision with respect to the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz; () failure to issue the ministerial decision with respect to the Postal Workers' Union of Bolivia (SINDECOBOL) and illegal deductions from workers' wages; () illegal deductions from the pay of workers belonging to the National Confederation of Urban Teachers of Bolivia; () failure to recognize the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation for supporting the strike, failure to issue the ministerial decision concerning the union, illegal pay deductions and dismissal of union officers; and () failure to issue the ministerial decision, illegal pay deductions and dismissal of union officers from the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union.
.In its communication of  May , the FENSEGURAL states that the dispute involving FENSEGURAL stems from the promulgation of Finance Act No.  of  November , section  of which provides that the social security funds must open fiscal accounts authorized by the Deputy Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs and its Regulatory Decree No.  of  January , section  of which establishes a -day period for the social security funds to open their fiscal accounts at a bank authorized by the Deputy Minister of the Treasury, namely the Banco Unin, and to submit to this outrage. FENSEGURAL points out that the CNS has already had fiscal accounts since  and the Government had no reason to demand that such accounts be re-opened, least of all via a bank such as the Banco Unin, which is now run by the State. According to FENSEGURAL, this shows that the Government was aiming to keep the social security assets in its own bank with clearly dubious intentions. The administrative authority issued a circular on  February  and sent it to the funds, including the CNS, instructing them to comply with this order, failing which they would be liable to penalties. The funds, together with the COB, issued a statement to the public concerning the attempted confiscation of resources.
.In view of this situation and other nationwide disputes, such as those concerning non-compliance with the demands submitted by the COB to the Government and the interruption of the dialogue concerning pay increases, which in the first instance was a proposal related to the cost of living to which the Government failed to reply, FENSEGURAL and the other COB member organizations decided to launch a general strike for an indefinite period. With mass participation of more than , out of the , national members, most of whom are concentrated in La Paz, FENSEGURAL was at the forefront of the COB demonstrations. Observance of the eight points submitted by the COB to the Government was called for, including the repeal of section  of Act No.  and section  of Regulatory Decree No. .
.On  April, the Ministry of Labour, via Ministerial Decision No. , declared the COB and FENSEGURAL strike to be illegal, as from  April. According to FENSEGURAL, the right to strike established in article  of the Political Constitution has been violated and the offence of pre-judgement is being committed, since the decision did not even indicate when the strike would end. Moreover, the right to negotiation arising from the dispute between the Government and the COB is being violated. In view of Ministerial Decision No. , as is appropriate in response to an administrative act of this nature, FENSEGURAL and other national organizations representing the CNS workers are filing a legitimate appeal with the same Ministry, and this is currently pending. On  April, the Minister of Health sent a note to the CNS general manager, to which Ministerial Decision No.  was attached, not only declaring the work stoppage supported by the CNS to be",-1,2011,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
24,"illegal but also instructing it to take measures such as dismissing the workers who were involved in the stoppage for more than six days. This was despite the fact that the Ministry of Health does not have the status of employer with regard to the CNS, since the latter is owned by the contributing workers and not by the State, least of all the Government.
.FENSEGURAL indicates that on  April the Government promulgated Supreme Decree No. , which provides that all public health establishments, social security management bodies and other non-profit-making establishments subject to agreements shall, on an exceptional and immediate basis, provide health care to persons affiliated to the CNS. It should be noted that all social security funds took part in the indefinite general strike declared by the COB. The complainant also adds that the CNS, being a health entity, did not stop providing emergency care and different shifts were organized to take part in the demonstrations (one group of workers being mobilized one day while others stayed at work, and vice versa the following day).
.On  April , another unconstitutional decree (Supreme Decree No. ) was promulgated, stating that in order to guarantee the exceptional regime of the previous decree, the revenue generated by the deductions accruing from the strike ' which was claimed to be illegal ' would be used for the purchase of medical supplies in oncology and paediatrics for the public health system networks. The Ministry of Health has its own budget, which is what it should use for this purpose and not seek to use the workers' money, as provided for by the previous supreme decree.
.On  April, an agreement was signed between the Government and the COB, to the effect that the strike would be suspended on  April, the decisions reached to be communicated to the authorities so that everything would return to normal in the country. On  May, because of the attempted pay deductions for the strike days and pressure from the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Health, FENSEGURAL and the COB met the CNS authorities. It was explained that while Ministerial Decision No.  issued by the Ministry of Labour declaring the strike to be illegal was being challenged by an appeal and until such time as administrative labour remedies were exhausted, no deductions could be made until a verdict was issued on the matter or it was overturned in favour of the workers. The lawyers and the authorities concurred and the general manager therefore ordered wages to be paid for April without any deductions, pending review by the Ministry of Labour. On  May, the Deputy Health Minister sent a note to the CNS general manager and ordered him to apply Supreme Decree No. , disregarding the document signed by the general manager, violating the managerial and administrative autonomy of the CNS and hinting that dismissals would occur at the CNS.
.On  May, the financial manager ordered deductions at three-day intervals as from April from all CNS staff, regardless of the fact that many workers had not taken part in the stoppage, such as those on holiday, those working on the night shift in hospitals, those working emergency shifts, kitchen and laundry workers, porters, ambulance drivers for the emergency networks, surgeons and operating theatre staff, and many others including those on sick leave, as well as FENSEGURAL officers on union leave and others belonging to the various social security unions throughout the country.
.FENSEGURAL considers that the above is clear evidence of violation of the rights established in the Political Constitution and that the agreement between the COB and the Government is broken. FENSEGURAL requests the Committee to send a commission to the country in connection with these facts.
.In its communication of  June , the FDTFLP alleges the following violations of trade union rights:' Case of Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez from the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos (pharmaceutical laboratories) enterprise: she was elected general secretary of the LAFAR Industrial Workers' Union from  February  to  February , and was also elected secretary for women s issues and social action from  May  to  May . Despite enjoying the union immunity established by article (VI) of the Political Constitution, she was wrongfully dismissed from her post in June  without regard for section  of the Labour Proceedings Code, which states that until such time as a ruling has been issued removing union immunity, the worker concerned shall remain in his/her post. To date, Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez has received no pay for more than two years, which is a clear violation of the right to organize. The background to the case is attached as evidence.' Case of Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova from the Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda enterprise: the officers were dismissed wrongfully and without due notice despite their union immunity, as recognized by Ministerial Decision No. / of  March  and Ministerial Decision No. / of  May . Further to the illegal dismissals and the issue of reinstatement orders by the Ministry of Labour, which the enterprise refused to implement, an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) was filed, having been declared admissible; despite this, however, the enterprise still refuses to reinstate the workers in their posts and in their union activities. To date, Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova have received no pay and been unable to exercise their union activities for a year, which is a clear violation of the right to organize.' Case of union officers Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina of the Novara SRL enterprise: the workers were elected as officers of the Novara SRL Industrial Workers' Union as from February . Despite having this status, they were wrongfully dismissed on  May , their union immunity thus being violated. The Ministry of Labour issued a reinstatement order. However, this public institution does nothing to enforce its decisions, thus failing to discharge its duties. To date, Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina have been unable to exercise union activity and have received no pay, which is a clear violation of the right to organize.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that the complaint presented by the COB reports the existence of a collective agreement (Panduro agreement) which provides for the possibility of settling collective disputes; however, nowhere does it identify the collective dispute in question, merely stating that there was a failure to comply with the agreement. It is therefore important to make the following clarifications: (a) the underlying basis for the Panduro agreement was the petition to reform the Pensions (Long-Term Insurance) Act, on the basis of contributions from the State and the employers. Honouring and respecting this agreement, the Government decided to set up labour commissions, with the participation of the COB. The discussions were concluded with the promulgation of the Pensions Act (No. ) of  December , in a public ceremony held at the offices of the COB itself, in the presence of the persons who presented the complaint to the International Labour Organization (ILO); and (b) it should be made clear that the Panduro agreement is not a collective labour agreement but a political agreement whereby the Government expresses its willingness to allow the participation of the labour sector in the formulation of preliminary draft legislation. However, this concession should not be construed as the delegation of constitutional powers to labour organizations; it should be made clear that the authority to legislate rests with the legislature of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in the context of the independence of state bodies, without any interference from the executive authority.
.The Government adds that its archives and records show that the last set of claims submitted by the COB to the Government was for  and no claims were submitted for ' . The wage increase for  provided for by the Executive of the Plurinational State was authorized under the powers established in article ()(I) of the Political Constitution, in accordance with section (I) of Supreme Decree No.  of  February  concerning the organization of the Executive. For this purpose, annual inflation of . per cent in  was taken into account and Supreme Decree No.  of  March  was issued, which determines a  per cent increase for .
.Here it should be noted that the fourth point of the Panduro agreement sets out the Government s undertaking not to approve any law that goes against the interests of the labour sectors affiliated to the COB. This wage increase was set at one percentage point above the annual inflation rate, thus setting a real wage increase of benefit to the workers, not to their detriment, as implied by the complaint which was presented; no measures were adopted at any time that involved",-1,2011,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
25,"pay reductions or freezes or an increase below the rate of inflation.
.With regard to the strike undertaken by certain sectors affiliated to the COB, the Government states that the action was pursued by a number of workers from two sectors affiliated to the COB (health and education) and certain members of the executive committees concerned. The COB states that the procedures concerning legal strikes established by section  of the General Labour Act had been exhausted, owing to the fact that the collective agreement signed in Panduro in  had allegedly not been honoured by the Government. Here reference should be made to article  of the Political Constitution, which provides that the right to strike is guaranteed as the exercise of the workers' legal entitlement to interrupt work in defence of their rights, in accordance with the law, and also section  of the General Labour Act of  December , which states that any unscheduled stoppage of work in any enterprise by either employers or workers shall be prohibited until all means of conciliation and arbitration provided for under the present title have been exhausted, otherwise the stoppage shall be deemed illegal. Moreover, article (II) of the Political Constitution states that health services shall be provided without interruption, and section  of the General Labour Act adds that the suspension of work in public services shall be prohibited. Any breach of the aforementioned provision shall incur the maximum penalties under the law. The Government indicates that the teachers, CNS workers and public health sector workers took part in the strike in blatant violation of the abovementioned legal provisions.
.As regards the right to strike, the Government guarantees the exercise thereof under the provisions of the Political Constitution and the General Labour Act. A strike represents an extreme course of action called for by a trade union when it has been unable to settle a dispute by means of conciliation or arbitration and involves a peaceful suspension of work; however, the violent mobilization instigated by the workers concerned violated the provisions of section  of the General Labour Act, which states that the concept of the strike means the peaceful suspension of work and any hostile act or demonstration against persons or property shall incur criminal penalties. In this context, the supreme task of the Government is to guarantee the fundamental right to education, health and work as provided for in articles () and (I) of the Political Constitution.
.As regards the allegation that the workers were the victims of brutality by the repressive apparatus of the State, were tear-gassed, illegally detained, subjected to criminal trials and harassed constantly by government officials, their trade union immunity thus being violated, the Government wishes to make it clear that the Plurinational State of Bolivia, by constitutional mandate, does not have a repressive apparatus but legally established defence and protection institutions. Article (I) of the Political Constitution states that the Bolivian police, as a public force, has the specific mission to defend society, preserve public order and enforce the law throughout the national territory. In this case it acted accordingly, protecting public safety, private and public property, the institutional heritage of the State and the national emblems.
.The Government adds that trade union immunity represents a constitutional guarantee conferred on union officers, in accordance with article () of the Political Constitution, Legislative Decree No.  (raised to the status of Act No.  of  February ) and Supreme Decree No.  of  May . Hence the Government has never disregarded the fundamental right of union immunity. On the contrary, it protects and guarantees it. All in all, the complaint lacks any factual or legal basis; the fulfilment of a constitutional mandate in response to events that violate the most basic principles such as social peace and respect for the state of law cannot be deemed a violation of trade union immunity.
.Finally, the COB states in its document that as a continuation of the direct negotiation procedure an eight-point agreement was signed on  April  at the Office of the Vice-President of the Plurinational State and it claims that the agreement was not honoured, inasmuch as Supreme Decree No.  of  August  was not repealed. It is important to note that the second point of the agreement between the Government and the COB states that a Supreme Decree will be drafted by both parties for promulgation on  May, providing for the definitive elimination of Supreme Decree No. . Thus Supreme Decree No.  was issued on the said date,  providing for the complete elimination of any legal provision or consideration established by Supreme Decree No. '  with the further establishment of a high-level commission representing both the Executive and the COB.
.The Ministry of Education, in order to guarantee the continuity and regularity of educational activities and the quality of the education service, in accordance with section  of Supreme Decree No.  of  February , which established education as a public service whose continuity and regularity is essential for the achievement of quality objectives, determined that any stoppages, strikes or unjustified absences would not be entitled to remuneration under the public education service regulations. Accordingly, with the exception of unionized teachers on union leave, teachers were guaranteed to be paid for days actually worked, on the basis of the procedure established in Ministry Decision No. / of  April , according to reports written by the departmental and district education directorates which were forwarded to the staff management unit of the Plurinational Education Service attached to the Ministry of Education.
.Finally, the Government emphasizes that the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in the context of ratified international instruments for the protection of the right to work, guarantees freedom of association at all levels, and also unions' right to the free exercise of functions assigned under the Political Constitution for the defence of workers' interests.
.In its communication of  September , the Government makes the following statement in relation to the allegations presented by the FDTFLP:()	Case of Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez from the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos enterprise: further to checks in the systems and archives regarding claims of violation of trade union immunity, no record was found of the complaint made by Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez regarding union immunity but only a  first summons regarding an occupational accident and a pay reduction'  Hence, there is no evidence of presentation of the formal complaint to the Ministry of Labour.()	Case of Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova from the Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda enterprise: the Ministry of Labour issued the corresponding reinstatement order to Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda, failure to implement which would incur the corresponding penalty and result in the Labour and Social Security Court being informed.()	Case of Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina of the Novara SRL enterprise: given the violation of union immunity, the Ministry of Labour will issue the corresponding reinstatement order to Novara SRL, failure to implement which would incur the corresponding penalty and result in the Labour and Social Security Court being informed.
.The Government wishes to point out that the Plurinational State of Bolivia does not have any sort of complicity with private enterprise; rather, the Ministry of Labour is an institution which is unyielding in the defence and protection of workers' constitutionally established social and labour rights, as expressed by the Political Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Trade union immunity is a constitutional guarantee conferred on union officers. The Ministry of Labour has acted in accordance with the labour legislation in force and has followed all due procedures for the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and union officers, bearing in mind that under paragraph IV of Supreme Decree No.  and Ministerial Decision No. / the workers have filed for constitutional amparo.
.As regards the allegations made by the FENSEGURAL, the Government makes the following statement:()	As regards the opening of fiscal accounts: section  of Finance Act No.  of  November  establishes that the social security funds must open fiscal accounts authorized by the Deputy Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs; in addition, section  of Regulatory Decree No.  of  January  establishes that the social security funds must open their fiscal accounts at the Banco Unin within  days. At no time did the Government seek to confiscate the financial resources of the social security funds; the only intention was to enforce Finance Act No. , inasmuch as the CNS and the other funds are public bodies which are subject to the law like any other institutions.()	As regards the indefinite general strike of the CNS: the request from the COB to repeal section  of Finance Act No.  and section  of Regulatory Decree No.  was inappropriate, since laws are not subject to negotiation but necessitate compliance. Accordingly, article  of the Political Constitution provides that the right to strike",-1,2011,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
26,"is guaranteed as the exercise of the workers' legal entitlement to interrupt work in defence of their rights, in accordance with the law. Moreover, section  of the General Labour Act of  December  states that any unscheduled stoppage of work in any enterprise by either employers or workers shall be prohibited until all means of conciliation and arbitration provided for under the present title have been exhausted, otherwise the stoppage shall be deemed illegal. Furthermore, article (II) of the Political Constitution states that health services shall be provided without interruption, and section  of the General Labour Act adds that the suspension of work in public services shall be prohibited. However, the teachers, CNS workers and public health sector workers violated the strike prohibition established by the General Labour Act without exhausting the conciliation and arbitration mechanisms provided for in the General Labour Act. A strike represents an extreme course of action called for by a trade union when it has been unable to settle a dispute by means of conciliation or arbitration and must involve a peaceful suspension of work; however, the violent mobilization instigated by the workers concerned violated the provisions of section  of the General Labour Act, which states that the concept of the strike means the peaceful suspension of work and any hostile act or demonstration against persons or property shall incur criminal penalties. In this context, the supreme task of the Government is to guarantee the fundamental right to education, health and work, as provided for in articles () of the Political Constitution, which indicate that guaranteeing public access to education, health and work forms part of the essential duties of the State.()	As regards the deductions for days not worked: further to the strike being declared illegal, Supreme Decree No.  was promulgated, which provides for deductions from all workers and professional staff at the CNS; moreover, it provides that the resources accumulated through these deductions shall benefit the oncological centres of the CNS itself through the purchase of specialist medicines, a situation that benefits the most needy persons affiliated to the social security schemes. For that reason, these resources cannot revert to the workers themselves. Before the deductions were made, the CNS was asked to send a list of staff on the payroll who took part in the strike but the list was never sent, and this resulted in deductions being made from CNS staff who were working shifts, from union officers, etc.
.Finally, the Government states that since  it has adopted various labour provisions and standards in favour of the workers, such as Supreme Decree No. , which promotes the labour stability of workers, raising Legislative Decree No.  concerning trade union immunity to the rank of Act No. , and above all the Political Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, which came into force in February  and is extremely protective of the workers, guaranteeing above all the stability and irremovability of trade union officers.
.In its communication of  November , the Government makes the following statement in relation to the additional information supplied by the COB:' regarding the ministerial decision relating to the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz: the archives of the Ministry of Labour show that Ministerial Decision No. / of  August  extended Ministerial Decision No. / of  April  concerning union recognition and union leave until  October , as well as the restructuring of the executive committee of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz. Consequently, mention should be made of the provisions of the Political Constitution, since this is the fundamental legal instrument of the State to which all standards of lower rank must be aligned. It should be noted that the Political Constitution maintains its juridical nature, being by definition the supreme and fundamental legal instrument within the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Therefore, when a fundamental instrument comes into force, its provisions must be applied with immediate effect. Accordingly, in line with the mandate established by article  of the Political Constitution, since the latter is the supreme instrument of the Bolivian legal system and takes absolute precedence, any other legal standard must be aligned to the new constitutional order in observance of, and coherence with, international human rights treaties and conventions ratified by the country and forming part of the constitutional bloc. In this context, according to the documentation sent by the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz, the existence of objections was initially determined regarding the failure of union officers to comply with the union s own regulations. Firstly, with respect to numbers and functions, it emerges that there are more than  elected officers, whereas section  of the union regulations stipulates  elected officers. Secondly, the leadership presence at its second general assembly does not reflect the class proportional representation that guarantees the hegemony of the proletariat in the structure and management of the confederation, in accordance with sections (d),  and  of the union regulations, approved by Supreme Decree No. . In the light of the above, and in view of the fact that the present request did not come within the scope of article (I) of the Political Constitution, ILO Convention No.  or the union s own regulations, it was impossible to continue with the procedures concerned inasmuch as the Ministry of Labour is prohibited in law from interfering in the internal and organic disputes of such organizations, in accordance with Article () of ILO Convention No. ;' regarding the ministerial decision relating to the SINDECOBOL: by means of Ministerial Decision No. / of  November , the Ministry of Labour recognizes the leadership of the SINDECOBOL located in La Paz, who were elected to hold office from  August  to  September . Consequently, on  July , the date on which the COB presented the additional information relating to the complaint, Ministerial Decision No. / was in force until  September . Hence this allegation is untrue and groundless since it is clear that Ministerial Decision No. /, which was issued with respect to SINDECOBOL, was in force on  July  and was valid until  September ;' regarding the ministerial decision relating to the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation: by means of Ministerial Decision No. / of  March , the Ministry of Labour recognizes the leadership of the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation and their entitlement to union leave during their elected term of office from  July  to  July . Moreover, on  July , the date on which the COB presented the additional information relating to the complaint, Ministerial Decision No. / was in force until  July . Hence this allegation is untrue and groundless since Ministerial Decision No. / was valid until  July  and has not been revoked by the Ministry of Labour;' regarding the ministerial decision relating to the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union: the ministerial decision relating to the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union which is valid until August  is still in force and has not been and will not be revoked by the Ministry of Labour.
.With regard to the deductions for taking part in the strike, the Government makes the following statement:' regarding the deductions from the National Confederation of Urban Teachers of Bolivia: section  of Supreme Decree No.  of  February  establishes that education is a public service in which the continuity and regularity of educational activities is essential for the achievement of quality objectives. Hence any stoppages, strikes or unjustified absences would not be entitled to remuneration or compensation of any sort under the public education service regulations. Accordingly, with the exception of unionized teachers on union leave, the teachers were paid for days actually worked, on the basis of the procedure established in Ministerial Decision No. / of  April , according to reports written by the departmental and district education directorates which were forwarded to the staff management unit of the Plurinational Education Service attached to the Ministry of Education;' regarding the deductions from SINDECOBOL in La Paz: with regard to the allegations of unjustified deductions from this union, the Bolivian Postal Service (ECOBOL), by means of communication DENAPER No. / of  April , asked the Ministry of Labour for information on the arrangements made by the COB and the measures that should be applied to the officials who were absent from work between  and  April . Accordingly, the Ministry of Labour sent ECOBOL the report of the Departmental Labour Chief of La Paz, attaching three administrative decisions which were issued concerning the strike days called by the COB. The aforementioned administrative decisions do not refer to the ECOBOL workers and hence the enterprise did not make any deductions with respect to the SINDECOBOL members in La Paz. However, ECOBOL, through its national personnel department in mutual agreement with SINDECOBOL in La Paz, allowed workers to leave their posts in groups of",-1,2011,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
27,"no more than  persons to enable them to take part in the protest marches called by the COB, without any deduction of pay. It should be noted that ECOBOL worked as normal during the strike days called by the COB;' regarding the deductions from the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation: the National Railways Enterprise (ENFE) comprises two sections, namely the western network, which is a state enterprise, and the eastern network, which has undergone privatization. The trade union within the ENFE western network is the Unified Single Railway Union, which enjoys full respect of its rights to organize and freedom of association, and so ENFE did not make any deductions from the affiliated workers or initiate any proceedings, let alone effect any dismissals, with respect to the strike days called by the COB. Accordingly, ENFE announced, by means of communication P.E./No./ of  October , that its eastern network, as a result of the privatization of the Bolivian railways, had ceased operations, assuming a residual function as administrator of the national heritage, not affecting the public rail service, and so the allegation made by the COB is totally untrue, since at no time were deductions made from the workers for the strike declared by the COB. The Ferroviaria Oriental SA enterprise, for its part, made no deductions of any kind from the workers for the dates of the work stoppage called by the COB in April , and the union officers are covered in their rights, benefits and obligations by the legal provisions in force, with no dismissals being effected.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the COB alleges that, owing to the Government s failure to comply with an agreement signed by the COB and the Government in the town of Panduro in May , it launched a general strike with protest marches in April  which were the target of brutal repression (involving assaults, gunfire, beatings and detentions) by the repressive apparatus of the State, and that subsequently: () a new agreement was reached with the Government on  April  with which the Government also failed to comply: () the ministerial decisions establishing the entitlement to union leave of the elected officers of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz, the trade union at the ECOBOL enterprise, the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union and the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation were not issued; () illegal deductions were made from the pay of workers who took part in the strike at ECOBOL and of workers belonging to the National Confederation of Urban Teachers of Bolivia, the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation and the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union; and () union officers were dismissed from the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation and the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union. The Committee further observes that: () the FENSEGURAL alleges that the strike undertaken by the workers of the CNS together with the COB was declared illegal and that, although an appeal was filed against the declaration, pay for the strike days was deducted from all staff, regardless of the fact that many workers did not take part in the strike; and () the FDTFLP alleges the dismissal of a number of union officers at various enterprises.
.With regard to the alleged repression by the repressive apparatus of the State (involving assaults, gunfire, beatings and detentions) of workers who were taking part in a strike and demonstrations, the Government declares that: () the Plurinational State of Bolivia, by constitutional mandate, does not have a repressive apparatus but legitimately established defence and protection institutions; () the Political Constitution states that the police, as a public force, has the specific mission to defend society, preserve public order and enforce the law throughout the national territory; () in this case, it acted to protect public safety, private and public property, the institutional heritage of the State and the national emblems; and () the fulfilment of a constitutional mandate in response to events that violate the most basic principles such as social peace and respect for the state of law cannot be deemed a violation of trade union immunity. Observing that the Government confirms the intervention of the police but does not refer to the alleged violence and that the complainant has not sent any specific information (names of the workers who were reportedly assaulted, injured or taken into custody, etc.), the Committee recalls that it has emphasized on many occasions that  in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities'  Also, the Committee recalls that  taking part in picketing and firmly but peacefully inciting other workers to keep away from their workplace cannot be considered unlawful. The case is different, however, when picketing is accompanied by violence or coercion of non-strikers in an attempt to interfere with their freedom to work; such acts constitute criminal offences in many countries' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. The Committee therefore invites the complainant organization to send to the authorities the names of the persons who were assaulted, injured or taken into custody during the general strike and demonstrations held in April  so that the Government can conduct an investigation without delay to determine responsibilities and, should excessive force prove to have been used, so that the perpetrators can be punished.
.With regard to the Government s alleged failure to comply with the agreements signed in Panduro in May  (according to the complainant, the Government failed to comply with what was agreed as regards not taking any decisions on pay increases without the consent of the COB) and on  April  (according to the complainant, the Government failed to comply with this agreement by not repealing Supreme Decree No. ), the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () the Panduro agreement was connected with the petition to reform the Pensions Act and in accordance with this agreement the Government decided to set up labour commissions with the participation of the COB and the discussions concluded with the promulgation of the Pensions Act (No. ) in December  at the COB offices; () the Panduro agreement is not a collective labour agreement but a political agreement whereby the Government allowed the participation of the labour sector in the formulation of preliminary draft legislation; () the COB did not submit a list of claims; () the pay increase for  is in line with the Panduro agreement in that it reflects the Government s undertaking not to approve any law that goes against the interests of the labour sectors affiliated to the COB; and () the agreement of  April  established that a supreme decree would be drafted by both parties to provide for the definitive elimination of Supreme Decree No. , this occurred in the form of Supreme Decree No. , and a high-level commission representing both the Executive and the COB was established. Observing that the versions of the Government and the complainant differ as regards compliance with the agreements, the Committee recalls  the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations' and in particular that  agreements should be binding on the parties' [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ].
.With regard to the allegations of failure to issue the ministerial decisions establishing the union leave entitlement of the elected officers of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz, SINDECOBOL, the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union and the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () with respect to the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz, the existence of objections in the documentation sent by the confederation was established in relation to non-compliance by its officers with the confederation s own regulations and hence it was impossible to continue with the procedures concerned; () with respect to SINDECOBOL, the allegation is untrue since Decision No. / remains in force until  September ; () with respect to the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation, Decision No. / remains in force until  July ; and () with respect to the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union, the ministerial decision remains in force until August  and will not be revoked by the Ministry of Labour. The Committee therefore expects that once the objections regarding non-compliance with the regulations of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz have been settled, the decision will be issued, if appropriate, establishing the union leave entitlement of the union officers concerned.
.With regard to the alleged illegal deductions of pay from workers who took part in the strike, namely members of",-1,2011,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
28,"the National Confederation of Urban Teachers of Bolivia, the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation and the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () with respect to the National Confederation of Urban Teachers of Bolivia, section  of Supreme Decree No.  of  establishes that education is a public service in which the continuity and regularity of educational activities is essential in order to achieve its quality objectives and hence any stoppages, strikes or unjustified absences will not be entitled to any remuneration or compensation, and accordingly the teachers were paid for days actually worked; () with respect to SINDECOBOL, the enterprise did not make any deductions with respect to the union members and allowed them to leave work in order to take part in the protest marches; () with respect to the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation and the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union, no deductions were made from the workers for their participation in the work stoppage. Taking all this information into account, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the dismissals of officers of the Eastern Rail Network Workers' Federation and the Santa Cruz Rail Workers' Union for taking part in the protests called by the COB, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the union officers are covered in their rights, benefits and obligations by the legal provisions in force and that no dismissals have occurred. Consequently, taking account of the above and the fact that the complainant organization has not sent any detailed information relating to these allegations (names, dates of the dismissals, etc.), the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations unless the complainant provides this information.
.With regard to the allegation that the strike undertaken by the workers of the National CNS together with the COB was declared illegal and that, although an appeal was filed against this declaration, wages were deducted from all staff for the strike days, regardless of the fact that many workers did not take part in the strike, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () Supreme Decree No.  provided for deductions to be made from all CNS workers and professional staff and for the resources accumulated through these deductions to benefit the oncological centres of the CNS itself; and () before the deductions were made, the CNS was asked to send a list of staff on the payroll who took part in the strike but the list was never sent, and so deductions were also made from staff who were working shifts, from union officers, etc. Recalling that  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], the Committee considers that such deductions should only apply to workers who take part in a strike or protest action. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the deducted pay is refunded without delay to those workers who did not take part in the strike of April .
.Furthermore, with regard to the strike being declared illegal by means of Ministerial Decision No.  (which was appealed against by FENSEGURAL), the Committee recalls that  responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that this principle is respected and to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal filed by FENSEGURAL against Ministerial Decision No.  whereby the strike in the sector was declared illegal.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of union officer Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez from the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos enterprise, the Committee notes the Government s statement that there was no record in the systems or archives of a formal complaint having been presented to the Ministry of Labour in connection with this allegation. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take steps to ensure that an investigation is conducted into the grounds for the dismissal and to keep it informed of the outcome.
.With regard to the alleged dismissals of union officers Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova from the Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda Enterprise, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the Ministry of Labour issued the corresponding reinstatement order to the enterprise and that in the event of failure to implement that order the corresponding penalty would be applied and the Labour Court would be informed. The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to ensure that the order for the reinstatement of the union officers is implemented.
.With regard to the alleged dismissals of union officers Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina from the Novara SRL enterprise, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the Ministry of Labour has acted in accordance with the labour legislation in force and has followed all due procedures for the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and union officers (according to the complainant, the administrative authority issued a reinstatement order) and that the latter have filed an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights). The Committee therefore requests the Government to ensure that the order for the reinstatement of the union officers in question is implemented and to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) reportedly filed by the persons affected.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee invites the COB to send to the authorities the names of the persons who were assaulted, injured or taken into custody during the general strike and demonstrations held in April  so that the Government can conduct an investigation without delay to determine responsibilities and, should excessive force prove to have been used, so that the perpetrators can be punished.(b)	The Committee expects that once the objections regarding non-compliance with the regulations of the Departmental Workers' Confederation of Santa Cruz have been settled, the decision will be issued, if appropriate, establishing the union leave entitlement of the union officers concerned.(c)	The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the deducted pay is refunded without delay to those National CNS workers who did not take part in the strike of April . Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal does not lie with the Government but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved, and to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal filed by FENSEGURAL against Ministerial Decision No.  whereby the strike in the sector was declared illegal.(d)	With regard to the alleged dismissal of union officer Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez from the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos enterprise, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that an investigation is conducted into the grounds for the dismissal and to keep it informed of the outcome.(e)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure the implementation of the order for the reinstatement of union officers Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova at the Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda enterprise.(f)	The Committee requests the Government to ensure the implementation of the order for the reinstatement of union officers Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina at the Novara SRL enterprise and to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) reportedly filed by the persons affected.",-1,2011,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
29,".The Committee last examined this case concerning allegations that, following a strike declared illegal, criminal proceedings were started against eight trade union officials at its November  meeting and on that occasion made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government: () to keep it informed as to the ruling that is handed down in respect of the trade union officials Freddy Puente Camacho, Wilma Alcocer Mayorga, Ral Limachi Choque, Mara Rosala Orellana Jimnez, Jos Maldonado Gremio, Jonny Calani, Marlene Ortz Flores and Jeny Vilma Camacho guila; and () to forward the present report and the abovementioned principles to the relevant judicial authority.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government states that the eight trade union officials in question have been acquitted by the judicial authority.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.This complaint is contained in a communication from the National Federation of Social Security Workers of Bolivia (FENSEGURAL) dated  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.The Plurinational State of Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that despite the Single Union of Social Security Workers of the National Health Fund of the Cochabamba Region (CASEGURAL CBBA) and the administration of the National Health Fund of the Cochabamba Region (CNS CBBA) reaching an agreement after the strikes on  and  February , the authorities of the Hospital Obrero Number  were requested verbally by trade union officials to give an explanation in relation to the head of personnel of the hospital (who had been dismissed and then exonerated, and was therefore allowed to be reinstated in his post), and notes that the authorities started criminal proceedings ' which to date are not closed and, according to the complainant, suggest systematic intimidation ' against eight members of CASEGURAL s board.
.The Committee notes that the Government refers in its reply to the agreement reached by the parties after the strike and that it states with regard to the alleged criminal prosecution of CASEGURAL trade union officials that: () the head of personnel of the Hospital Obrero Number , Juan Carlos Ayala, filed, as an individual and not as an official of the CNS, a complaint and charge against Freddy Puente Camacho and others for the offences of preventing or obstructing the exercise of duties and for violations of the freedom to work; () the Government cannot prevent or restrict an individual from appealing, if he so wishes, to the judicial authority requesting the law be applied; () on  February  the Prosecutor of Cochabamba, after reviewing the evidence, decided to formally accuse Freddy Puente Camacho, Wilma Alcocer Mayorga, Ral Limachi Choque, Mara Rosala Orellana Jimnez and Jos Maldonado Gremio of committing offences punishable under sections  (obstruction or prevention of the exercise of duties),  (crimes against public health),  (illegal lockout, strikes and stoppages) and  (violation of the freedom to work) under the Criminal Code and to formally accuse Jonny Calani, Marlene Ortiz Flores and Jeny Vilma Camacho guila of committing offences punishable under sections  and  of the Criminal Code; () the substantiation of the accusation indicates that the offences of preventing, obstructing or, where relevant, restricting the freedom to work, as stipulated in sections  and  of the Criminal Code, are considered de jure to be intentional wrongdoings and are enforceable when the mere act of preventing, obstructing or where relevant restricting labour activity occurs; () in this case, by illegally imposing a general strike at the CNS with the aim of preventing the head of personnel from carrying out his work, the accused parties prevented and obstructed the normal performance of his duties as a public official, thus infringing on his fundamental right to work, and their actions thereby constituted the offences stipulated in sections  and  of the Criminal Code; () the proceedings were started on  June ; the oral hearing was fixed for  December  but had to be suspended because the defence lawyer resigned; later the hearing fixed for  June  was suspended because none of the judges appeared; on  January  the hearing was again suspended because Trial Court No.  did not have a technical judge in office; () the executive branch was not responsible for the suspensions of the oral hearings; and () with the intervention of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security an agreement was reached between the parties of the labour dispute, establishing that the days of strike would not be deducted.
.In this respect, the Committee, like the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considers that criminal sanctions should not be imposed on any worker for participating in a peaceful strike and therefore, measures of imprisonment should not be imposed on any account; such sanctions may only be imposed if during a strike violence against persons or property or other infringements of common law are committed for which there are provisions set out in legal instruments and which are punishable thereunder. The Committee also recalls that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , para. ]. The Committee highlights that according to the Government criminal actions against the trade union officials were not brought by the Hospital Obrero Number  but by the head of personnel as an individual and that the trade union and employer reached an agreement which brought to an end the dispute. In these circumstances, the Committee expects the Government to forward the present report as well as the abovementioned principles to the relevant judicial authority. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.

.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the Trade Union Confederation of Health Workers of Bolivia (CSTSB) alleges violation of Convention No.  by the Government. It states in particular that, on  December , it presented a list of claims for  to the Ministry of Health and Sports which, together with the Ministry of Labour, instead of promoting solutions by means of appropriate negotiation, merely declared that a strike that was carried out was illegal. The complainant organization adds that, although the legal procedures for the exercise of the right to strike were respected, the administrative authority ordered the submission of the names of the workers who had participated in the strike for the purpose of making the respective salary deductions in order to frighten the workers.
.The complainant organization also alleges that certain clauses of the collective agreement concluded in  with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Finance were not complied with and that, as a result, the content of those clauses was included in the claims for . According to the complainant organization, the Ministry of Health and Sports, far from encouraging and promoting machinery for negotiation, unilaterally imposed the payment of a wage increase, without debate or discussion (the complainant organization cites as examples Ministerial Circular MS-and-D/DESP// and the merit increment).
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that the CSTSB represents officials of health federations and unions of the nine departments of the Republic of Bolivia. With regard to the allegations concerning Convention No. , the Government states that the Bolivian State, through the national Government, promotes full rights for the functioning of trade unions in Bolivia, under the following legal provisions:' Article  of the Political Constitution of the Bolivian State provides that:  Freedom of employers to form associations is guaranteed. Unionization is recognized and guaranteed as a means of defence, representation, welfare, education and culture of workers, as is trade union immunity as a guarantee for union officials while carrying out activities in the specific performance of their duties, for which they may not be prosecuted or arrested. Moreover, the right to strike is established as the exercise of the legal entitlement of workers to withhold their labour to defend their rights, after complying with the legal formalities. ?Section  of the General Labour Act provides that:  The right to form unions, which may be employers' organizations, trade unions or professional associations, whether mixed, industrial or at enterprise level, is recognized. ?Section  of the General Labour Act provides that:  The essential purpose of the union is to defend the collective interests it represents.

.The Government adds that the President of the Republic of Bolivia has promulgated Supreme Decree No. , a legal instrument through which the State guarantees the freedom of workers to unionize, from the date of election of their leaders. Furthermore, the Ministry of Labour, in accordance with its legally conferred powers, by means of Ministerial Decision No. / of  February , has recognized the executive board of the CSTSB, elected for the period from  October  to  October , made up of  trade union leaders. The leaders of the Confederation concerned were officially declared as being on secondment with entitlement to  per cent of their salary and other labour rights, in accordance with the provisions of section  of Supreme Decree No.  of  January . Furthermore, the Government states that section  of the General Labour Act provides that  Public servants may not unionize regardless of their category and status' 
.The Government considers that, for the reasons stated and in view of the legal provisions in force and national government policies, the complaint presented by the CSTSB alleging failure to comply with Convention No.  by Bolivia s Executive is shown to have no basis whatsoever. In the specific case of the organization concerned, the fact that it assumed the role of intermediary between the Government and the worker members of the federations united by it shows that the Ministry of Labour of Bolivia did not at any level deny the exercise of the right to unionize. The activities of the complainant organization were declared legal, it was recognized as a legally established organization and its leaders were officially declared as being on secondment so as to guarantee full and absolute freedom of association.
.With regard to the allegations relating to compliance with Convention No.  and specifically to the request made by the CSTSB in the list of claims for a wage increase, the Government points out that on  March , by means of Note No. /, the Minister of Health and Sports informed the executive secretary of the complainant organization that the national Government had provided a detailed reply to all the points raised in the list of claims. The trade union organization agreed to several points, which indicates the progress made in dealing with the sectoral claims. With regard to the central points of the list of claims, the Government indicates that the reply sent indicated the Government s decision, by means of Supreme Decree No. , to approve a wage increase for all public and private sector workers in Bolivia.
.Furthermore, the Government indicates that, on  June , by means of Note No. /, the Minister of Health and Sports informed the President of the Republic of the following:  We have been informed of the request made by the leaders of the CSTSB for consideration to be given to its demands set out in its list of claims for . As soon as it became aware of these claims, my Authority convened the leaders of this Confederation for dialogue, as proven by the fact that the first and only meeting was held on  February , which they abandoned based on their refusal to discuss the list of claims with the Committee appointed by my office. Following this failure of dialogue caused by the leaders of the CSTSB, the leaders requested a written reply to all the points in their claims, which was met with a reply to the  points in the list of claims, dated  March . The leaders subsequently submitted a counterproposal to us, in which they accepted more than  per cent of our reply, which we took into account in continuing to negotiate the handling of the points not agreed upon. Regrettably, without offering any explanation, the Confederation declared a national -hour strike, which was declared illegal by the Ministry of Labour. Despite this attitude, we subsequently convened further negotiations on  April , which were not attended by the Confederation, which discredited and refused to recognize the authority of the Deputy Health Minister and the General Adviser from my office, whom I had appointed to continue the dialogue.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:

This benefit was to be paid from May , but regrettably, this was once again obstructed by the leaders of the complainant organization, who questioned and challenged the instructions for the evaluation procedure issued by the Ministry of Labour in a circular dated  May addressed to the departmental (regional) health services (SEDES) to initiate the payment of this benefit. The directors of the departmental (regional) health services are currently being asked once again to send the list of persons eligible for a merit increment so that the payment can be initiated as soon as possible. With regard to the vaccination bonus, the Government points out that the payrolls are being prepared to meet this commitment on  July, as laid down in the Supreme Decree. The Government emphasizes that it has fulfilled its undertaking in respect of the sector presenting the complaint and that the workers of this sector have been awarded the  per cent increases established for their seniority bonus, infant nursing benefit and border-worker subsidy, all paid retroactively from January of the current financial year. Furthermore, they are to receive the same percentage increase in the service increment, which was paid together with the vaccination bonus on  July .
.The Government emphasizes that, in these circumstances, efforts are clearly being made to agree upon criteria with all social sectors, both public and private, so that wages increase annually in line with the rising cost of living.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the Trade Union Confederation of Health Workers of Bolivia (CSTSB) alleges that, in December , it presented a list of claims for , that the authorities of the Ministry of Health and Sports and the Ministry of Labour failed to promote collective bargaining and merely declared that a strike carried out in the sector was illegal (according to the complainant organization, in order to frighten workers, the names of the strikers were demanded so as to make the relevant salary deductions) and, finally, that the administrative authority imposed the payment of a wage increase without holding a debate.
.The Committee notes that the Government mentions the legal provisions which, in its view, guarantee trade union rights and compliance with Convention No.  in Bolivia and with regard to the complaint it states that: () the CSTSB is recognized as a legally established organization and by means of Ministerial Decision No. / of  February  its executive board was recognized and its leaders were placed on official secondment with full salary entitlement; () the General Labour Act provides that public servants may not unionize regardless of their category and status; () in reply to the CSTSB s list of claims, the Minister of Health and Sports provided a detailed reply to all the points raised, the complainant organization agreed to several points and it was notified of the Government s decision to approve by supreme decree a wage increase for all public and private workers; () following a meeting with the complainant organization held on  February  and the reply of the Minister of Health and Sports to the list of claims, dated  March , the CSTSB sent a counterproposal and then, without any explanation, declared a national -hour strike which was declared illegal by the Ministry of Labour; () the Ministry of Health and Sports convened the CSTSB to further negotiations to be held on  April , but the organization did not attend and, on  April , it was informed of the Government s decisions, including its decision to consider the matter of the list of claims concluded given that the CSTSB had rejected dialogue; () in this context Decree No.  establishing a wage increase of  per cent and Decree No.  providing for an additional increase of  per cent for the health sector were promulgated; and () the only matter remaining pending with the sector is the payment of a merit increment, which has not been made since the executive board of the CSTSB has obstructed the respective procedure.
.Firstly, the Committee notes the Government s statement that section  of the General Labour Act provides that public servants may not unionize, regardless of their category and status. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has recognized the complainant organization and its leaders. The Committee recalls that  public servants, like all other workers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing, without previous authorization, for the promotion and defence of their occupational interests' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, sixth edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the General Labour Act so as to ensure that public servants enjoy the right to establish and join organizations of their own choosing.
.With regard to the negotiation of the list of claims for  presented by the CSTSB and the alleged unilateral imposition of a wage increase, the Committee notes the contradictory information provided by the Government and the complainant organization. The CSTSB alleges that the authorities of the Ministry of Health and Sports failed to promote collective bargaining, while the Government states that it convened the parties on at least two occasions and that, even though the CSTSB did not participate in the second meeting, it declared a national strike. In this regard, observing that the collective bargaining process was not carried out in a structured manner and with every effort being made, the Committee emphasizes that  genuine and constructive negotiations are a necessary component to establish and maintain a relationship of confidence between the parties' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee hopes that in future the authorities and the trade union organizations concerned in the health and sports sector will endeavour to enforce this principle. In this regard, the Committee considers that the collective bargaining problems mentioned in this case seem to be linked to public servants not having the right to organize (including those in the health sector) and, therefore, to the lack of legal framework regulating the exercise of the right to collective bargaining by public servants who are not engaged in the administration of the State, a right recognized in Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to establish a legal framework in this area, even though it observes that in practice trade union organizations exist and collective bargaining takes place.
.With regard to the declaration by the administrative authority that the strike held was illegal, the Committee notes that the Government states that, in the context of the negotiation of the list of claims and following the submission of a counterproposal, the CSTSB, without any explanation, declared a national -hour strike, which was declared illegal by the Ministry of Labour. In this regard, the Committee recalls that  Responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal, where this is necessary, lies with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved.
.With regard to the allegation that, in order to frighten workers, the administrative authority ordered the submission of the names of the strikers for the purpose of making the respective salary deductions, the Committee recalls that  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the General Labour Act so as to guarantee that public servants enjoy the right to form and join organizations of their own choosing and to establish the legal framework regulating the right to collective bargaining of public servants not engaged in the administration of the State.(b) The Committee hopes that in the future, the authorities and the trade union organizations concerned in the health and sports sector will endeavour to hold constructive negotiations and that",-1,2008,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

33,".The Latin American Confederation of Judiciary Workers (CLTJ) presented its complaint in a communication of June . It presented new allegations on  August .
.At its May  meeting, the Committee observed that despite the time which had elapsed since the last examination of the case, it had not received the information requested of the Government. The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it may present a report on the substance of the case even if the Government s observations or information have not been received in due time and requested the Government to transmit the information requested as a matter of urgency [see th Report, para. ].
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of June and  August , the CLTJ alleges violation of the right of assembly, reprisals and acts of persecution against the trade union leaders of the National Association of Employees of the Judiciary and the Administration (ANAFUJA). It refers in particular to disciplinary proceedings (No. /-SER) initiated ex officio by the Council of the Judicature against Ms Magda Valdez Meja, Chairperson of ANAFUJA La Paz. Moreover, administrative proceedings were initiated against Ms Ana Mara Murillo Michel, Chairperson, and Mr Lucio Medrano Flores, General Secretary of ANAFUJA Nacional which resulted in their suspension, for three months and one month, respectively, and in which their right of defence was not observed. According to the complainant organization, these measures were taken as a result of the votes cast by the trade union leaders during an extraordinary assembly of ANAFUJA La Paz and ANAFUJA Nacional, which took place in accordance with the statutes and regulations and which was convened in reaction to non-compliance with an agreement reached between the judicial authorities and ANAFUJA on  August . The assembly voted in favour of strike action with a view to forcing compliance with the agreement and protesting against the restructuring process under way in the judiciary. It was in the light of these decisions that the sanctions were imposed.
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the case was last examined, the Government has not sent the information requested although it has been invited on various occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, to submit its observations and comments on the case.
.Under these circumstances, and, in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is bound to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information it hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the ILO for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for trade union rights, in law and in fact. The Committee remains convinced that if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognize the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them.
.The Committee observes that, according to the CLTJ, the trade union leaders of ANAFUJA at national level and at the level of the district of La Paz (Ms Magda Valdez Meja, Chairperson of ANAFUJA La Paz, Ms Ana Mara Murillo Michel and Mr Lucio Medrano Flores, members of ANAFUJA Nacional) were the subject of disciplinary proceedings and sanctions of one to three months of suspension from duty because of their participation in an extraordinary assembly of the trade union organization where it was decided, by vote, to authorize a strike condemning the non-compliance by the judicial authorities with an agreement reached on  August , and protesting against the restructuring process under way.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to ensure that an inquiry is held into the administrative proceedings and the sanctions of suspension imposed on the trade union leaders of ANAFUJA Nacional and ANAFUJA La Paz and, if it is found that these measures were taken because the trade union leaders legitimately exercised their right to vote at an extraordinary assembly of the trade union, to take the necessary steps to ensure that said measures are set aside and that they are reinstated in their posts with back pay, if this has not been done yet. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to ensure that an inquiry is held into the administrative proceedings and the sanctions of suspension imposed on the trade union leaders of ANAFUJA Nacional and ANAFUJA La Paz and, if it is found that these measures were taken because the trade union leaders legitimately exercised their right to vote at an extraordinary assembly of the trade union, to take the necessary action to ensure that said measures are set aside and that they are reinstated in their posts with back pay, if this has not been done yet. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",-1,2007,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
34,".The Committee last considered this case at its meeting of March , where its requested the Government to initiate mediation efforts with a view to helping the parties to reach a global solution (reinstatement or, if this is not possible on account of the time that has elapsed, financial compensation if not yet received) for the alleged acts of anti-trade union discrimination, in particular, bearing in mind that months after the collective agreement on the dispute, signed  May , the employment contracts of many strikers have not been renewed. Mediation should further endeavour to find a solution to the criminal and civil suits that have been brought by both parties in connection with the strike, dating back to April . The Committee also asked to be kept informed of developments and of judicial decisions [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that, through mediation, the parties involved in this case reached a global solution, as recommended by the Committee, as regards both financial compensation and court cases. This final solution was achieved through consultation and conclusion of two transactional agreements. The first of these agreements was signed on  February  between the company and leaders of the Federation of Factory Workers. The agreement was ratified and complemented by a second transactional agreement of  October  between the company and the workers directly involved. These documents essentially provide for the following agreements whereby the dispute is terminated: () the employer undertakes to withdraw unconditionally the suits brought against former employees and renounces any compensation for damages caused during and as a result of the strikes; () the workers involved likewise withdraw their suits against the company; () both parties agree to recognize that social benefits were paid and collected in timely fashion, but decide to carry out a tripartite review of the corresponding payments in one month s time.
.The Committee takes note of this information with satisfaction.
.This complaint is contained in a communication dated  February  from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September  and  January .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) claims that the company Moda Express Ltda. (MEX) has undergone rapid expansion in the past decade, that its profits have increased exponentially and that this has been achieved through the imposition of illegal, inhuman and slavery-like working conditions which have led to the deaths of two workers.
.According to the complainant, on  April , faced with this situation, the workers presented the company with a list of demands; not long after this, workers who had signed the document were dismissed. On  April , angered by these unjustified dismissals,  workers at the MEX textile factory who were members of the trade union of employees of the company Moda Express Ltda. (MEX) declared a general strike. They remained on the street in front of the company's premises for several days, without obtaining any undertaking from the company to respect labour rights. They were finally removed by police who burst in violently on the workers as they slept. A number of the workers were detained for more than eight hours.
.On  May, a collective agreement between the parties was signed in the presence of Ministry of Labour representatives. Although the agreement provided for the reinstatement of the striking workers, only  workers went back to work for the company and were able to do so only after new contracts of employment were signed for periods of six months to one year. The company forced these  workers to sign an apology for instigating the strike, to renounce their seniority and all the social benefits which they had enjoyed before the strike and to make up for the lost days of production. Once training had been given to new workers hired by the company, almost none of the  workers had their contracts renewed. The complainant states that at the date of the submission of the complaint, only  of the workers who had participated in the strike and had been reinstated were still with the company. A complaint was submitted to the Ministry of Labour in January  and the case is before the Labour Court.
.The complainant explains that the  workers who were temporarily reinstated did not include the trade union officials and those with greater seniority; these workers were not paid the  bonuses and received insignificant social benefits. The company thereby reneged on the undertaking to respect trade union rights which it had accepted by signing the collective agreement.
.The Ministry of Labour declared the strike illegal in resolution No. / of  April . The company initiated legal proceeding against union officials and members ( in all) for participation in an illegal strike, sabotage and incitement in Criminal Investigations Tribunal No. . The judge issued arrest warrants against the workers (these have still not been carried out), basing its decision on section  of the Penal Code according to which any person who instigates a lockout, strike or stoppage which has been declared illegal by the labour authorities can be punished by imprisonment of between one and five years and a fine of between  and  days' wages. The complainant fears that the sanction that may be applied will be a fine so heavy that it will be impossible for the officials to pay it. Where a person fined is insolvent, the penalty applied is imprisonment. The WCL alleges that this case sets an extremely serious precedent in criminalizing a strike and that this could become an increasingly common practice intended to intimidate Bolivian workers in the exercise of their rights. In addition to the criminal proceedings, the company has started a civil action against a number of the workers.
.In December , Mrs. Graciela Mamani, a former official of the company union, was elected by the National Industrial Congress as a member of the General Confederation of Industrial Workers of Bolivia with special responsibility for promoting women's interests. The MEX plant challenged the result of the union election which the Ministry of Labour then refused to ratify.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states, first, that the list of demands presented by the workers was thought by the employer to be excessive and not in tune with the social realities of the country, in that it meant a  per cent increase in labour costs. The Government also states that there is no evidence that the list of demands was approved by the workers' assembly, and that the current leadership maintains that there was no such approval and indeed that signatures were falsified and the list put forward by an adviser for reasons unconnected with trade union interests. All this violates national legislation (sections  and  of the Regulating Decree of the General Labour Act).
.Secondly, the Government indicates that the trade union declared the general strike before the expiry of the statutory ten-day period within which employers can reply to workers' demands (section  of the above Decree) and before they had exhausted the conciliation measures provided for in legislation. There is also evidence that the measure in question was not adopted by the assembly or without the majority required under legislation. There was no five-day advance warning of the strike, which was a violation of section  of the General Labour Act. The union placed pickets in the vicinity of the plant and the pickets prevented access by non-striking workers and company representatives. According to the Government, there were many complaints concerning the attitude of the strike pickets, who acted violently on company premises, destroying equipment and company infrastructure. A police report contains an account of an attack involving the virtual kidnapping of an official who had been sent to investigate. The current leadership of the union denounces the pressure put on dissident workers which violates the constitutional right of dissent. The Government indicates that the police intervention was limited to efforts to maintain public order and that there were no arrests or detentions of trade union officials or members.
.The Government maintains that the right to strike is not absolute, unlimited or entirely discretionary, and that the individuals who planned the strike failed to comply with the legislation governing the exercise of that right in Bolivia.
.Many conciliation meetings were arranged for the parties to the dispute under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour. Representatives of the Confederation of Workers of Bolivia (COB), the La Paz District Federation of Industrial Workers (FDTFLP) and the Confederation of Industrial Workers of Bolivia (CTFB) participated in these meetings.
.The Government indicates that according to the company, the illegal strike stopped production and export of MEX products for more than  days, causing losses of more than US$,.
.At the end of April , MEX employees held",-1,1999,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
35,"internal union elections. On  May , with the participation of the organizations referred to above (COB, FDTFLP and CTFB), a new collective agreement was signed according to which the workers were to suspend their stoppage and the company undertook to re-hire  of the workers who were considered to have been dismissed for abandoning their work. This did not include those workers who were involved in other legal dismissal proceedings for valid reasons, who were nevertheless paid all their employment and associated benefits.
.The Government maintains that throughout all these proceedings, the Ministry of Labour endeavoured at all times to provide the parties with the means for conciliation and consultation, in accordance with its duty to encourage negotiations and safeguard the exercise of workers' and employers' fundamental rights.
.MEX, acting in its capacity as an employer, initiated criminal proceedings at the end of , accusing some of its former workers of sabotage and other offences.
.In August  the former union officials initiated their own proceedings under employment law in order to defend the rights of the dismissed workers under the terms of the collective agreement. To that end, they brought a complaint of violation of trade union privilege and non-compliance with the collective labour agreement. The lower court ruled that the case was unproven in respect of the allegation concerning violation of trade union privilege and proven in respect of the alleged violation of the collective agreement. Both parties appealed against this ruling. Another application relating to violation of trade union privilege and non-compliance with the collective agreement was suspended following the lower court ruling against the claims of the former union officials.
.Judicial proceedings have also been initiated by the company MEX against the senior labour court judge and others who, it is alleged, were implicated in falsification of evidence and documents in the proceedings before the tribunal.
.As regards the staff cuts, the Government explains that according to the company, these resulted from the company's inability to maintain its position in a very competitive export market and from acts of sabotage and deliberate damage at its premises, facts which, it claims, have been recognized by the parties in the dispute. The cuts were agreed by the workers following consultations with the country's principal trade union organizations.
.According to information supplied by MEX and a review of existing official records, general conditions of employment concerning daily working hours, timetables, safety and medical assistance, have thus been brought into line with labour and social standards and the workers have not made any demands in this respect.
.The Government categorically rejects the claim that strikes are outlawed in the country and considers that it is inappropriate and indeed misleading to generalize on the basis of an illegal strike without any other evidence. In Bolivia, according to the Government, there is no provision for systematically penalizing trade unionists who resort to measures such as strikes and peaceful protests; on the contrary, peaceful protests are almost everyday occurrences in the country's major cities. The Government adds that strikes are not outlawed, indeed they occur frequently and the authorities often show considerable tolerance in the face of threats to public order. The Government maintains that in the process of legislative reform that is now under way, the Penal Code will be reviewed, as agreed with the major workers' and employers' organizations, and the Government will propose reform of that Code to the legislative assembly.
.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that Mrs. Mamani was elected as an official of the General Confederation of Industrial Workers of Bolivia in December . The company MEX did not - as it was claimed in the complaint - challenge that appointment. However, Mrs. Mamani was not named in the ministerial order recognizing the union's officers because she had not shown that she met one of the statutory requirements for holding trade union office - that is, that she worked regularly and actively in the relevant sector and had done so for a certain minimum period. This requirement is specified by Legislative Decree No.  of  June , and both the Confederation of Workers of Bolivia and the Confederation of Private Employers, during the last direct contacts mission to the country, expressed the wish that this requirement be retained. Lastly, Mrs. Mamani continues to carry out the functions entrusted to her by the General Confederation of Industrial Workers of Bolivia and the fact that she was not named in the ministerial order has not prevented her from carrying out those duties.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant alleges a series of measures against officers and members of the trade union at the company Moda Express Ltda. Those measures were adopted by the company and the authorities following a strike which began on  April  and, according to the complainant, included detentions, declaration of illegality of the strike by the administrative authorities, the removal of workers from in front of the plant, numerous dismissals, non-renewal of many employment contracts of strikers after the signing of an agreement which ended the strike and provided for the reinstatement of the workers, legal proceedings and possible criminal sanctions, pressure to sign a statement of apology for going on strike, and other anti-union acts. The complainant also alleges that the election of Mrs. Gabriela Mamani to union office was challenged by the company.
.The Committee notes, on the other hand, that the Government refers to the illegal, irregular and violent nature of the strike and claims in particular that the list of demands was not approved by the workers' assembly or by the majority required under legislation (the current union officers maintain that there was no such approval and that signatures were falsified); that the union did not adhere to the statutory time limit of ten days within which the employer can reply to workers' demands; and that strike pickets barred access to non-striking workers and acted violently, destroying equipment and company infrastructure (the employer initiated criminal proceedings against some workers for sabotage and other offences) and assaulting and virtually kidnapping an official. According to the Government, the police confined itself to maintaining public order, there were no arrests and the Ministry of Labour made it possible at all times for conciliation and consultations to take place. The Government indicates that a collective agreement between the company and the new union leaders provided for the reinstatement of  of the dismissed workers. The Government also points out that the former trade union officers started judicial proceedings (currently before a court of second instance) relating to trade union privilege and failure to comply with a collective agreement. According to the company, the staff cuts were connected with the strike and damage to company property. Lastly, the Government is disposed to amend the provisions of the Penal Code which make illegal strikes punishable by imprisonment.
.On the other hand, the Committee recalls that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ) and regrets the damage done to property at the company Moda Express Ltda., the fact that pickets prevented non-striking workers and company representatives from entering company premises (see Digest, op. cit., para. ) and the fact that signatures were falsified; however, it also regrets that the company resorted to collective sanctions which, by their very nature, do not take account of different degrees of individual responsibility and that after a period of several months it did not renew the contracts of employment of the strikers whom it had undertaken to reinstate.
.The Committee also notes that the Government cites non-compliance with legislation on strikes by the trade union concerned and the fact that there is no evidence that the list of demands was approved by the workers' assembly or by the majority required under legislation. In this regard, the Committee would point out that the Committee of Experts in its comments on the application of Convention No.  by Bolivia in  and previous years criticized certain restrictions in respect of the right to strike, such as the requirement for a majority of three-quarters of the workers of the enterprise to call a strike (section  of the Act and section  of the Regulation), the unlawful nature of general and sympathy strikes which are liable to penal sanctions (sections  and  of Legislative Decree No.  of ), the recourse to compulsory arbitration by decision of the Executive Power to put an end to a strike (section  of the General Labour Act), and the lack of provisions to protect workers who are not trade union leaders against anti-union discrimination. The Government expressed a commitment to the Committee of Experts to ensure the amendment of all of the provisions which were not in conformity with the Convention (see Report III (Part A), , pp. -). Furthermore, legislation allows the Minister of Labour, rather than",-1,1999,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
36,"an independent body, to declare a strike illegal, contrary to the principles of the Committee (see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and ). Under these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to adopt measures as a matter of urgency with a view to amending legislation concerning strikes in respect of all the points raised in the conclusions, and with regard to the need to ensure that strikes may be declared illegal only by an independent body, given that excessive requirements and restrictions in many cases make legal strike action impossible in practice and can give rise to abuses when workers realize that they will be breaking the law anyway.
.As regards the mass sanctions adopted by the company against the strikers without regard to the degree of personal responsibility in each individual case and the limited number of perpetrators of violent acts, the Committee cannot rule out the possibility that the abuses committed by the trade union may be related to the excessive restrictions imposed by legislation on the right to strike and the lack of adequate legal protection against acts of discrimination against workers. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to begin mediation initiatives with a view to ensuring that the parties can find a comprehensive solution to the alleged acts of anti-union discrimination (reinstatement or, if this is not feasible because of the time that has elapsed, financial compensation if this has not already been paid), taking into account the fact that months after the signing of the collective agreement on  May  by a new union committee many strikers had still not had their contracts of employment renewed, and with the aim also of resolving the issue of the criminal and civil proceedings which the parties began in the courts following the strike in April . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee emphasizes that no worker on strike who has acted peacefully should be subject to criminal sanctions, and asks the Government to reform the Penal Code with this principle in mind and to inform it of any rulings that are handed down in this regard
.Lastly, as regards the allegation concerning the non-registration of the election of Mrs. Gabriela Mamani as a member of the General Confederation of Industrial Workers of Bolivia, the Committee notes that the company did not contest the election. The Committee notes the Government's statements to the effect that the non-registration was based on her failure to meet the statutory requirement of having worked regularly, actively and for a minimum period in the company. The Committee emphasizes that it is for union by-laws to determine the conditions of election of trade union officials. Nevertheless, in the present case, the Committee notes that in practice, Mrs. Mamani can carry out her trade union activities. The Committee notes that the Committee of Experts raises this question in its comments concerning the application of Convention No. .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to adopt measures as a matter of urgency with a view to amending legislation concerning strikes in respect of all the points raised in the conclusions, including those of the Committee of Experts.(b) The Committee requests the Government to begin mediation initiatives with a view to ensuring that the parties can find a comprehensive solution to the alleged acts of anti-union discrimination (reinstatement or, if this is not feasible because of the time that has elapsed, financial compensation if this has not already been paid), taking into account the fact that months after the signing of the collective agreement on  May  by a new union committee many strikers had still not had their contracts of employment renewed, and with the aim also of resolving the issue of the criminal and civil proceedings which the parties began in the courts following the strike in April . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c) The Committee emphasizes that no worker on strike who has acted peacefully should be subject to criminal sanctions, and asks the Government to reform the Penal Code with this principle in mind and to inform it of any rulings that are handed down in this regard.(d) The Committee notes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations raises the question concerning the eligibility of trade union leaders in its comments concerning the application of Convention No. .",-1,1999,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
37,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting (see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), in which it came to interim conclusions.
.Given the lack of information provided by the Government on the issues pending, the Committee has had to postpone the examination of this case on three occasions. At its November  meeting, the Committee also drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it might present a report on the substance of this case at its next session, even if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time (see th report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), para. ). To date, no information from the Government has been received.
.Bolivia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the Committee's previous examination of the case, the issue concerning the consequences of the state of emergency in Bolivia, declared in April  following strikes in major sectors, demonstrations and marches, remained pending. More specifically, the Committee made the following recommendations (see th Report, para. ):... the Committee stresses that the state of emergency is incompatible with the full exercise of freedom of association. It urges the public authorities not to resort in the future to such measures. The Committee requests the Government to confirm that the state of emergency has been lifted. It requests the Government to provide information on the manner in which the constitutional provisions concerning the state of emergency were applied and on the impact of its application on trade union rights. It emphasizes that the consequences of the state of emergency which have violated the rights of trade unionists must be set aright. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that all those who were dismissed be reinstated in their jobs and to guarantee the full exercise of freedom of association.
.First of all, the Committee regrets that the Government has not communicated the observations requested on the issues pending, despite the time which has elapsed since the last examination of the case and that it was invited to submit its comments and observations on a number of occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal.
.In these circumstances, in accordance with the applicable procedural rule (see para.  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session), the Committee will have to present a report on the substance of the case without being able to take account of the information it hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee would remind the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure instituted by the International Labour Organization to examine allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact; the Committee therefore remains confident that, if the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward (see first Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee has noted that the state of emergency, declared under Supreme Decree No.  of  April  and approved by the Council of Ministers under a resolution dated  April , was extended by  days. According to article  of the Constitution ""the Executive shall not extend the state of emergency beyond  days or declare another within the same year ..."".
.As regards the consequences of the state of emergency (April ) on trade union rights, the Committee, noting that the state of emergency has come to an end and that the Government has not provided the information requested on this matter, urges the Government once again to redress any wrongs that might have been inflicted on trade unionists as a result of the state of emergency and to ensure that all those who might have been dismissed for their trade union activities be reinstated in their jobs.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that the Government has failed to send its observations on the issues that remained pending during its last examination of the case, in spite of having been invited to do so on a number of occasions.(b) Despite the fact that the state of emergency declared in April  has come to an end, the Government has not provided the information requested on its consequences on the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee, therefore, urges the Government once again to redress any wrongs that might have been inflicted on trade unionists as a result of the state of emergency and to ensure that all those who might have been dismissed for their trade union activities be reinstated in their jobs.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  April and  May  respectively.
.Several trade union organizations had previously requested the Director-General of the ILO to intervene with the Government of Bolivia concerning the same acts alleged in the above-mentioned complaints.
.In response to the intervention by the Director-General of the ILO, the Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April . Subsequently, the Government sent a new reply in a communication dated  May .
.Bolivia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleges that on  April  a special unit of the Bolivian police stormed the headquarters of the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization (COB) during the holding of a national meeting of trade union officials which decided to pursue its protest action against government policies and at the same time continue its dialogue with the Government. All the trade unionists present were arrested, as well as attending journalists. Throughout the country more than  leaders were arrested and sent into internal exile to various regions, in particular San Joaqun ( persons), Apolo ( persons), Ramn Daro ( persons), Colcha ( persons) and Puerto Rico ( persons). The WCL includes in an annex two lists of  persons who were arrested and sent into internal exile or held in detention.
.Furthermore, after the declaration of a state of emergency during the night of - April , following the above-mentioned arrests, the Government of Bolivia suspended basic rights, and in particular the right to strike and the right to assemble of trade union organizations. Through these measures, which according to the WCL are a serious infringement of human and trade union rights, the Government is attempting to deliver a blow to any protests by workers and their organizations against the social and economic policy of the Government, a policy which accentuates inequalities and injustice. The social security reform and the constant privatizations have resulted in massive lay-offs, as well as the reduction and disappearance of social protection for a large number of workers and members of their families. Furthermore, Act No.  to reform education is the clearest example of the refusal by the Government to solve the situation through consensus. By modifying the text established by the various parties concerned - modifications involving very sensitive and controversial points - the Government sought confrontation rather than a lowering of tensions.
.The WCL concludes by stating that the workers expressed their discontent with the anti-social policy implemented by the Government, in particular through demonstrations and strikes, which are legitimate means available to them to defend their social and economic interests, but instead of listening and trying to understand the reasons for the population's discontent, the Government reacted in a brutal and dictatorial manner.
.In its communication of  May , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that the Government ordered a state of emergency throughout the territory of Bolivia on the night of - April . Hours before, the police burst into the headquarters of the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization (COB), during a meeting of the National Executive of this organization and proceeded to detain those present, including Mr. Oscar Salas, its executive secretary. At the same time, national and regional trade union leaders were arrested in various parts of the country and held in confinement at various military posts. The total number of persons thus detained was  (the ICFTU includes a list in the appendix to its communication). The emergency measure was promulgated by the Government supposedly to put an end to the daily demonstrations organized over a period of six weeks by the strike",-1,1995,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
38,"committees of teachers in the public education, health workers and workers in the COMIBOL state mining enterprise, all of whom were supported by the COB. The teachers' trade unions had gone on strike in support of wage claims and to express their opposition to a bill to reform the educational system.
.The ICFTU points out that the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization (COB) and the Government, with the mediation of the Catholic Church, were engaged in negotiations, which was the reason why the COB convened on  April the above-mentioned National Executive to assess the progress achieved. On the same day, the Office of the President of the Republic sent a communication to the trade union leader Oscar Salas, congratulating the COB on the mature attitude shown by its officials in resolving problems which affected them mutually. The state of emergency was ordered a few hours after the dispatch of this letter (the ICFTU encloses a copy).
.The ICFTU adds that given the seriousness of the situation it decided to send as a matter of urgency on  April a mission from the ICFTU, its regional organization for the Americas (ORIT) and the Coordinating Committee of Central Trade Union Organizations of the Southern Cone (of which the COB is part) with a view to gaining first-hand information on the situation of the detained trade unionists and requesting their immediate liberation. This mission confirmed that there were serious violations of human and trade union rights: trade unionists were arrested in a violent manner, their trade union premises were searched, they were beaten with electric truncheons by the police and sent into internal exile in distant places where they were kept incommunicado. Some of them were sick without any access to medical treatment.
.Furthermore, according to the ICFTU, the clandestine Single Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB) denounced the disappearance of its leader Mr. Flix Santos whose name does not appear on the official lists provided by the Government of persons arrested and sent into internal exile.
.Similarly, the ICFTU alleges that the Trade Union of Press Workers of La Paz denounced the fact that on  April , during a violent attack by the police on the National Executive of the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization (COB), around  journalists, cameramen and photographers were brutally beaten, as were the trade unionists present. Some journalists were arrested and taken to a hangar at the air force base in El Alto. Some of them were sent into internal exile. When the state of emergency was introduced, the Minister of Government promised to release immediately all persons who had been detained, but this did not happen. Ten days later, ten journalists were released, but at least six press workers are still being held in confinement.
.Finally, the ICFTU states that the ICFTU/ORIT mission was harassed and persecuted by the Bolivian authorities after expressing at a press conference the international trade union movement's solidarity with and support for the workers and people of Bolivia. Mr. Alan Flores, President of the Single Trade Union Workers of Paraguay, and Mrs. Maria del Carmen Leunda, ICFTU secretariat official responsible for Latin America, were arrested in the El Dorado de La Paz Hotel, where they were staying, and taken to an unidentified place. They were not allowed to contact their respective embassies. Subsequently, they were taken to the Secretariat of Migrations, where they were told that the delegation had been declared non grata in Bolivia because its presence and activities constituted serious interference in the internal affairs of the country. Following mediation by some international bodies, they were able to return to their hotel later although they were forced to leave the country the following day.The Government's reply
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that for a long time different social and trade union sectors, some acting independently and others within the framework of the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization (COB), have been carrying out acts contrary to the normal exercise of their activities and the development of the country in general, such as work stoppages, strikes, blockades and acts of violence against persons, property, public order and social peace. The most serious case is that of urban and rural teachers who have so far prevented the resumption of classes in the public sector throughout the country.
.The Government adds that in response to this clearly politicized trade union movement promoted by sectors interested in thwarting the implementation of the reforms established by the Government of the President of the Republic, the administration has made every effort through dialogue and conciliation to find negotiated and mutually satisfactory solutions to the problems raised by the different labour sectors, including with the good offices of the Catholic Church, without any positive response from the leaders of the COB. On the contrary, the COB executive has stepped up its pressure through acts of vandalism, hunger strikes, blockades and the sabotage of public services, all of which are contrary to the political Constitution of the State and the laws of the Republic.
.As a result of all the events occurring in the national territory as noted above, the Government, in pursuance of the powers conferred upon it by articles ,  and () of the Political Constitution of the State, declared a state of emergency on  April  throughout the national territory, with the support of the Council of Ministers.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the denunciation made does not objectively reflect the true framework and context of the situation of social conflict and fails to note the share of responsibility for this situation by the labour movement headed by the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization, which resulted in serious street disturbances and disruption of public order for more than  days and a work stoppage by teachers for a similar period, which finally led to the recent declaration of the state of emergency. The Government points out that the socio-labour movement itself lost control of the dispute to a small group of Trotskyist radicals which distorted the just labour demands and called for the unconstitutional shortening of the mandate of the democratically elected Government. However, the Government, adopting an attitude which was widely recognized by the public as being both tolerant and democratic, urged the workers to engage in dialogue with a view to finding appropriate solutions to their claims through consensus.
.To this end, the Ministry of Government sent two notes on  February and  March  to Mr. Oscar Salas Moya, executive secretary of the COB, informing him of the full withdrawal of the police during the demonstrations and marches. This same information was communicated to Mr. Javier Baldiviezo, executive secretary of the Confederation of Rural and Urban Teachers of Bolivia, in a note dated  February .
.During the negotiations, which were convened by the Executive, both the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization and the national teachers systematically used pressure in the form of constant street demonstrations of a violent nature which threatened the life and property of other citizens, disrupting public order and peace through acts which were unworthy of the valuable process of dialogue initiated between the COB and the Government.
.As regards the denunciation concerning the supposed raid on the trade union premises by the police and military authorities and the repression of demonstrations and gatherings described as peaceful, the Government points out that it acted in full respect of trade union freedom and immunity and that the intervention of the police, in pursuance of the provisions of the Political Constitution of the State and the laws of the Republic, was strictly limited to the specific mission of maintaining public order and peace and protecting the large majority of citizens whose rights of free circulation and work were affected. As a result of this emergency action, some trade unionists of extremist tendencies were temporarily held in preventive detention, which was fully subject to the national legal order. At present they enjoy full freedom and all the guarantees afforded by the Government concerning respect of their human rights.
.Finally, the Government states that on  May  an agreement was reached between the COB and the Government whereby the Government, in pursuance of the ILO Conventions which it has adopted, satisfied the wage demands put forward by the COB.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations have alleged the detention or sending into internal exile of more than  trade unionists, the raiding of trade union premises, the assault of trade unionists and the declaration of a state of emergency - all as a result of strikes in various sectors (education, health, etc.) - as well as harassment by the authorities of members of an ICFTU/ORIT mission which expressed its solidarity with the Bolivian workers.
.The Committee notes the statements by the Government which basically emphasized:
.First, as regards the declaration of the state of emergency and the subsequent suspension of certain constitutional guarantees and rights, the Committee should examine whether, in the light of the circumstances of the case, the measures adopted",-1,1995,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
39,"as a result of the declaration of the state of emergency violated trade union rights.
.In this respect, although it has noted the intensity of the collective action taken by the trade union organizations during a long dispute related to matters of great importance to the country (privatization, social security reform, educational reform, etc.) and repudiates the acts of violence against persons and property to which the Government refers, the Committee must emphasize, with a view to determining whether the measures adopted by the authorities were contrary to freedom of association, several points mentioned by the complainant organization: first, the very high number of trade unionists arrested or sent into internal exile (more than , according to the complainants); second, at least some of these arrests and internal exiles and the search of trade union premises occurred hours before the declaration of the state of emergency; third, such measures were taken when the Government was negotiating with the trade union organizations of the country (the complainants provided a copy of a letter from the Minister of the Presidency dated  April  which refers to ""important progress achieved in the negotiations"" and notes that ""the leaders of the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization have acted in a clear spirit of maturity in the negotiations"").
.In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the scope and seriousness of the measures adopted by the authorities within the framework of the state of emergency, precisely at a time when negotiations were under way which had allowed significant progress to be achieved, were contrary to freedom of association and their objective and result were largely to neutralize the trade union movement as a whole, in violation of Convention No. . In this context the Committee must deplore the arrests and internal exiles, the search of trade union premises and the acts of aggression against trade unionists, and the fact that the Government had not considered other solutions or alternative formulas. Noting that the persons who were arrested or sent into internal exile now enjoy full freedom and that the Government and the COB reached an agreement on  May , the Committee stressed that the state of emergency was incompatible with the full exercise of freedom of association (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ). It requests the Government to confirm that the state of emergency has been lifted and to provide information on the manner in which the constitutional provisions concerning the state of emergency were applied and their impact on trade union rights. The Committee emphasizes that the consequences of the state of emergency which have violated the rights of trade unionists must be set aright, in particular, in that all those who were dismissed be reinstated in their jobs and that the full exercise of trade union rights be guaranteed.
.As regards the allegation concerning the harassment by the authorities of members of an ICFTU/ORIT mission which expressed its solidarity with the Bolivian workers, the Committee regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on this point, deplores the hostility which was shown to the members of this mission and the arrest of the trade union leaders Alan Flores and Maria del Carmen Leunda, who were forced to leave the country because of their trade union activities, and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that ""any assistance or support that an international trade union organization might provide in setting up, defending or developing national trade union organizations is a legitimate trade union activity."" (See th Report, Case No.  (Cuba), para. .)
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the mass arrest and internal exile of trade unionists, the search of trade union premises and the assault of trade unionists, as well as the fact that the Government had not considered other solutions or alternative ways of resolving the labour dispute between the Bolivian Workers' Central Organization and other trade union organizations and the Government.(b) Noting that the persons arrested or sent into internal exile now enjoy full freedom and that the Government and the COB reached an agreement on  May , the Committee stresses that the state of emergency is incompatible with the full exercise of freedom of association. It urges the public authorities not to resort in the future to such measures. The Committee requests the Government to confirm that the state of emergency has been lifted. It requests the Government to provide information on the manner in which the constitutional provisions concerning the state of emergency were applied and on the impact of its application on trade union rights. It emphasizes that the consequences of the state of emergency which have violated the rights of trade unionists must be set aright. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that all those who were dismissed be reinstated in their jobs and to guarantee the full exercise of freedom of association.(c) As regards the allegation concerning harassment by the authorities against the members of an ICFTU/ORIT mission which expressed its solidarity with the Bolivian workers, the Committee deplores the hostility shown to the members of this mission, the arrest of the trade union officials Alan Flores and Maria del Carmen Leunda, who were forced to leave the country because of their trade union activities, and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that any assistance or support that an international trade union organization may provide in setting up, defending or developing national trade union organizations is a legitimate trade union activity.",-1,1995,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
40,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  December . The Government replied in communications dated  and  February  (when the Government refers to the statements it made in a communication dated  December , in reply to the complaints submitted to the Director-General of the ILO by a number of international trade union confederations, in which they requested that the ILO contact the Government of Bolivia in connection with the same issues that the ICFTU raises in this case).
.Bolivia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  December , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that on  October , the teachers' trade union officials declared a hunger strike - the number of strikers totalled , throughout Bolivia - in support of the wage dispute started by , urban teachers, who were nevertheless continuing with their classes as normal. This strike had the backing of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB). Twenty-one days into the strike, a number of teachers were in a pre-coma state.
.The ICFTU points out that the conflict had arisen when the teachers asked for a bonus to compensate for cost-of-living increases during the year, consisting of  bolivanos (approximately  US dollars). They had been paid this bonus in  and , as a result of an agreement with the previous Government. The present Government refused to acknowledge this acquired right and, therefore, to pay the bonus, on the grounds that there were no funds in the State Treasury.
.The ICFTU adds that as the movement was growing and spreading to other sectors, the Government responded by declaring a state of emergency and proceeded to arrest thousands of workers (all those workers on hunger strike) and banished about  trade unionists to internal exile in districts in the forest area of the country. Daniel Santalla, Secretary-General of the COB, was amongst those arrested, together with eight officials from the National Executive Committee. Wilma Plata, head official of Public Prosecutor's Office in the Department of La Paz, was also arrested and brutally beaten up at the moment of her arrest. It is particularly striking that the Government decreed a state of emergency for three months, on the grounds of an alleged public danger - such was the description of the trade union's hunger strike - and then proceeded to repress and arrest workers and send them to desolate areas, thus violating their human and trade union rights.
.The Government states that on  August , only two days after the new Government had taken office, trade union officials representing the teaching profession asked for a wage increase exceeding  per cent. This increase in the total pay of the teaching and administrative staff would have meant that the budget for wages of the Ministry of Education and Culture accounted for  per cent of the national budget. It should not be forgotten that the previous Government (which left office on  August ) had had more than half a year to take the necessary legal steps and make a budget allocation for a wage bonus or supplement in , but they had done nothing. Neither is there any evidence of an agreement between the Ministry of Education and the teachers' confederations on the presumed obligation to make a special payment to ensure that the normal commitment to end the school year was fulfilled.
.Nevertheless, the Government, always open to dialogue, received the trade union requests but pointed out that the wage claims had to be considered in the light of the economic and financial possibilities within the  financial year. The trade union officials in this branch of activity dismissed outright the Government's proposals and, as a means of pressure, called a hunger strike (the strikers received adequate medical attention in due time). Justifying the action on the basis of an erroneous concept of trade union solidarity, the unions proposed that this hunger strike should spread to other trade union sectors, thereby seriously threatening to disrupt public law and order. In spite of the intransigence of the teachers' trade union officials, the Government, in an attempt to maintain social peace, reopened talks with the confederations of urban and rural teachers of Bolivia and a number of delegates from the Bolivian Central of Workers. It succeeded in reaching a written agreement, which provided for the setting up of a committee, made up of representatives of the executive power and the teaching profession - entrusted with putting forward a favourable solution to the teachers' request in the  financial year, but ensuring it was in line with the irrefutable need to maintain economic and financial stability within the country. At the same time, the trade union officials undertook to end the hunger strike, as a prerequisite for beginning the work of this committee, acting with respect for trade union immunity and the current Bolivian Code of Education.
.The Government adds that it acted with the certitude that this agreement would end the dispute and pave the way for a peaceful and adequate solution to the issue. However, unexpectedly, the agreement was rejected, seemingly because of the existence of interested parties within the teachers' movement, most of whom belong to the Federation of Urban Teachers of La Paz. There were calls to extend and step up the dispute, leading to violent action and public unrest, thus turning the strike movement into a political attempt to destabilise the democratic system and undermine the constitutionally established authority. This resulted in systematic and recurrent acts of street violence which seriously disturbed public law and order and created a state of internal unrest. Given the decision of the trade union leadership of Bolivian teachers and the situation, the Government felt bound to decree a state of emergency on  November , in accordance with the Constitution. The Government points out that  citizens were arrested after the state of emergency had been adopted. After making a detailed assessment of the records of these persons, it was decided to exile  of them to various districts throughout the Republic. The number of persons in exile was gradually reduced as, after a personal assessment had been made of each case, the Government ordered their release. In the first ten days of December , there were no more citizens in exile within the country or persons detained whilst awaiting criminal proceedings in connection with these events. To be more precise, the trade union officials Baldivieso, Osorio and Garabito are completely free and are not facing any charges whatsoever before the normal courts.
.The Government specifies that the state of emergency was decreed on the very brink of a serious institutional crisis, because there was danger that the social events would extend beyond the trade union executives - themselves with marked internal differences - and lead to a chaotic situation of conflict with the Constitution and democratic system in force. As a result of the general amnesty granted by the Government before Christmas , all the problems that had arisen as a result of the dispute described above were resolved. There is not one single person in exile, either within or outside the country, on account of the events that occurred amongst the teachers and in other branches of activities.
.At present, the Ministry of Education is open to dialogue with the legal representatives of the teachers, as they have already been offered a readjustment of their salaries in . However, there are many other problems besides the question of salaries: the shortcomings of the educational system itself, the high level of illiteracy, etc. The Ministry of Education wishes to convoke the teachers to discuss implementation of the educational reform and is relying upon their active particiption. The wage problems and others are inter-related.
.Finally, the Government points out that its determination to respect and promote freedom of association is clear in the provisions contained in the recent Supreme Decree No. , which grants facilities to trade union officials and their organisations in the exercise of their duties.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant organisation alleged that the Government refused to grant teachers a wage supplement to compensate for the cost-of-living increases in  and that the Government's reaction to the hunger strike declared on  October  by trade unionists in the teaching profession in support of their claims (a movement that grew and spread to other sectors) consisted in declaring a state of emergency, arresting thousands of workers (including those who were on hunger strike) and banishing more than  of these workers to internal exile.
.As regards the Government's refusal to grant teachers a wage supplement to compensate for the cost-of-living increases in , the Committee notes the Government's explanation that there was a lack of budgetary reserves until , that it considered the wage claims excessive, and",-1,1989,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
41,"that there was no agreement or previous arrangement between the authorities and the trade union organisations concerning the payment of such a wage supplement. The Committee wishes to recall the principle in collective bargaining whereby: ""the question as to whether one party adopts an amenable or uncompromising attitude towards the demands of the other party is a matter for negotiation between the parties within the law of the land"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, third edition, , para. ). The Committee notes that, according to the Government, a written agreement was reached with the trade union leadership (later rejected by the same leadership) which provided for the setting up of a joint committee entrusted with finding a solution to the problems, and that the Ministry of Education had offered a wage readjustment in  and was proposing to convoke teachers' representatives to discuss issues concerned with the educational reform.
.As regards the alleged measures taken by the Government in response to the hunger strike declared by the teachers' union officials and the strike movement that spread to other sectors, the Committee notes that the Government acknowledges that it declared a state of emergency and arrested or banished to internal exile a large number of trade unionists and workers.
.The Committee notes that the reasons given by the Government for adopting these measures can be summarised as follows: () the trade union leadership rejected a written agreement which it had signed with the authorities and which put an end to the dispute; () there was a systematic outbreak of street violence and calls to extend and step up the dispute, leading to violent action and public unrest, thus turning the strike movement into a political attempt to undermine the constitutionally established authority.
.The complainant organisation did not provide any explanation to the Committee as to why the trade union leadership rejected the agreement that it had reached with the authorities. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that the Government did not merely resort to the usual emergency measures against acts of street violence and their perpetrators, but declared a state of emergency, arrested  workers and trade unionists and banished  of them to internal exile (according to the Government's own figures), thus taking unusually harsh steps, out of all proportion, that prevented any form of subsequent trade union action and the exercise of trade union rights in general.
.Consequently, the Committee deeply deplores the measures taken by the Government and concludes that they infringed the principles of freedom of association contained in Conventions Nos.  and  and that, given the large number of workers and trade unionists concerned, everything would seem to point to the fact that these measures were not only taken against the perpetrators of acts of violence but also against those taking part in trade union activities. In this respect, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of their trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association (see Digest, para. ) and that arrests and dismissals of strikers on a large scale involve a serious risk of abuse (see Digest, para. ). The Committee also points out that the imposition of sanctions, such as internal exile or banishment for trade union reasons, constitutes a violation of the principles of freedom of association and that it is unacceptable that sanctions of this nature should be imposed by administrative action (see Digest, para. ).
.Finally, the Committee notes that during the first ten days of December , nobody was either detained or in internal exile, the state of emergency had been lifted and, before Christmas , the Government granted a general amnesty.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) the Committee deeply deplores that the authorities arrested  trade unionists and workers (of whom  were banished to internal exile) following trade union action in the teaching sector in October ;(b) the Committee, while noting that all the measures of arrest and internal exile are no longer in force, draws the Government's attention to the principles contained in the conclusions concerning the inadmissibility of arresting and subjecting trade unionists to internal exile for trade union reasons;(c) the Committee expresses the hope that the discussions with the teachers' trade union organisations that the Government is proposing to hold on matters relating to teaching - in conformity with the agreement apparently reached previously with the interested parties - will result in satisfactory agreements for both parties.",-1,1989,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
42,".In a telegram of  September , the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint against the Government of Bolivia alleging violation of ILO's Conventions Nos.  and . The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) sent communications dated  and  September , respectively, alleging violations of freedom of association in Bolivia. Additional information was received from the ICFTU in a subsequent communication of  September . The Government responded to the allegations in letters dated  September and  October .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In its telegram of  September , the ICFTU reports having been informed by the ""Bolivian Workers' Confederation"" (COB) that on  August the Bolivian Government adopted serious measures against Bolivian workers in the form of a -day state of emergency which effectively suppressed trade unions' rights and freedoms. These measures were taken prior to a march of mineworkers on the nation's capital, La Paz, to protest against government plans to close several mining centres and to privatise others. The COB called for a general strike against these measures; the Government prohibited the strike and arrested  persons, trade unions leaders for the most part, and deported them to other parts of the country (Puerto Rico, San Joaqun and Magdalena).
.In its letter of  September , the WFTU describes the social consequences of the policy of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which recently sent a delegation to Bolivia to review the Government's economic policy. The IMF had insisted on the strict application of severe austerity measures before granting a  million US dollar loan to cover the nation's balance-of-payments deficit. Consequently, the Bolivian Government took steps to close down unprofitable enterprises, including two tin mines in Oruro, and to suspend the day-to-day operations of five other mines in the Potos region; these steps resulted in the dismissal of approximately , workers. At the same time, the Government decided to privatise the mining industry. Faced with the prospect of losing their jobs, more than , miners of the Oruro and Potos regions went on strike, demanding that the State continue operating the mines and protesting against the Government's austerity measures. It was against this background that the Government declared the state of emergency and arrested more than  organisers of the miners' strike which, according to the WFTU, was widely supported by popular and trade union organisations. The WFTU adds that about  persons were deported to inhospitable regions, which can only be interpreted as restricting freedom of movement and thereby denying the free exercise of trade union rights. The WFTU adds that those arrested include Mr. Jos Maria Palacios, Mr. Aldo Flores and Mr. Felipe Tapia, all trade union leaders of the COB, as well as Mr. Andres Soliz Rada, Executive Secretary of the Bolivian Union of Journalists (FTPB). According to the WFTU, the Government declared the state of emergency under the pretext that the miners' strike had been devised by an extreme left-wing revolutionary movement to overthrow the current Government of Mr. Victor Paz Estenssoro; it abolished the right to strike and the right to organise, and suspended the inviolability of the home.
.In its communication of  September , the WCL stresses that the Bolivian Government declared the state of emergency in response to the COB strike and peaceful demonstration in defence of workers' legitimate interests.
.With its communication of  September, the ICFTU enclosed a legal opinion prepared in January  by the COB on the Bolivian Government's infringements of the law and the Constitution, specifically through Decrees Nos.  and . The ICFTU reports that , miners are currently engaged in a hunger strike to protest against the closing of several mines and the dismissal of hundreds of workers. The complainant organisation adds that the state of emergency has considerably restricted trade union rights and freedoms.
.On  September , Bolivia's permanent mission in Geneva forwarded a reply prepared by the Minister in charge of negotiations, together with an agreement dated  September between the Government and the Trade Union Federation of Mineworkers of Bolivia (FSTMB). This communication reports that the state of emergency was decreed by the Bolivian Government on  August , in accordance with special constitutional powers in response to the social unrest that was threatening Bolivia's representative and pluralistic democratic system; on  September , the Government released all  trade union leaders who had been detained as a preventive measure under the special provisions of Bolivia's Constitution. Negotiations between the Government and the Trade Union Federation of Mineworkers of Bolivia, with the mediation of the highest authorities of the Catholic church, led to a framework agreement on modalities for the decentralisation of the Bolivian Mining Corporation (COMIBOL), the largest autonomous mining enterprise in Bolivia.
.In a second communication dated  October , the Minister in charge of negotiations furnished additional information. He indicated that Presidential Decree No.  of  August  was adopted to establish decentralisation machinery with the participation of miners, in order to reduce the deficits suffered by the State's mines. It was imperative that Bolivia's mining industry be protected against a structural crisis which had been aggravated by the instability of the international tin market, especially as tin is the country's most important mining export. The measures taken in this connection provoked a reaction on the part of the Trade Union Federation of Mineworkers of Bolivia, which organised a mineworkers' march on La Paz in violation of national law and of Conventions Nos.  and ; right from the start, according to the Government, the demonstration went beyond the objectives of a legitimate trade union protest march and became a deliberate attempt to provoke a social crisis that would destabilise Bolivia's Government and put an end to the democratic process that the Bolivian people have maintained at such great sacrifice since . The trade union protest march developed into a serious and unconstitutional threat to law and order and led the Bolivian Government to declare a state of emergency by means of Presidential Decree No.  of  August , in accordance with the Constitution. Confronted with this crisis, the Government undertook negotiations with the FSTMB with the mediation of the Bolivian Bishops' Conference, as a result of which the parties reached an agreement on the planned decentralisation of COMIBOL, the State's mining enterprise.
.The Committee notes that this case involves the Bolivian Government's declaration, on  August , of a state of emergency and its adoption of exceptional measures that curtailed trade union rights. The Committee notes the Government's claim that the state of emergency was declared in accordance with constitutional provisions with a view to quelling social unrest. The Committee notes that Chapter IV of Title Two of Bolivia's Constitution, concerning the preservation of public order, empowers the President, with the approval of the Council of Ministers, to declare a state of emergency in cases of internal disorder or international war, for a period of up to  days (Article ). The state of emergency does not ipso facto suspend the rights and guarantees granted by the Constitition, but it does permit the arrest and summons of persons charged with conspiring against public order (Article , paragraph ), and their confinement to other regions in order to protect public order (Article , paragraph ).
.These measures followed a strike and demonstration organised by workers to protect their jobs against what they claimed was the Bolivian Government's decision to close down a number of tin mines, in compliance with the IMF's request; the complainants' claim that the strike and demonstration were peaceful is not contested by the Government. The Committee deplores the fact that these peaceful events led to the arrest and banishment of trade union leaders, since workers must be allowed to exercise their trade union activities freely. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, all persons arrested or banished have been released unconditionally.
.While noting that the exceptional measures taken by the Bolivian Government to overcome a difficult situation were taken in conformity with Bolivia's Constitution, the Committee points out that the peaceful exercise (strike and demonstration) of trade union rights by workers should not lead to arrests and deportations. Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that in this particular case it does not have sufficient information to ascertain whether the real intention of the workers participating in the protest march on La Paz was, as the Government claims, to destabilise Bolivia's democratic system and the Government of President Estenssoro or merely to express the legitimate claims of workers determined to defend their jobs. The Committee recalls that it has always considered that the detention of trade union leaders for activities related to the exercise of their trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association. However, the Committee notes that, shortly after the above-mentioned events, government authorities and",-1,1986,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
43,"the Trade Union Federation of Mineworkers of Bolivia agreed to work together to resolve the problems in this sector (mine closures, management decisions affecting workers, reinstatement of dismissed workers, the turning of mines into co-operatives, restructuring of jobs). According to this agreement, persons that had been detained or placed under house arrest were released and the trade union federation called off the general strike and the hunger strikes. The Committee is of the opinion that both parties are showing a willingness to negotiate and that social tensions are diminishing.
.Although it is not within the Committee's competence to comment on economic measures which a Government may take in difficult times or on the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund, the Committee nevertheless notes that decisions involving the dismissal of large numbers of workers should be discussed extensively with the trade union organisations concerned with a view to planning the occupational future of these workers in the light of the country's opportunities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) As regards the state of emergency, the Committee deplores its existence, but notes that under Bolivia's Constitution it should not exceed  days.b) The Committee deplores the fact that the exceptional measures provided for in the Constitution should have led to the arrest and banishment of many trade union leaders for the peaceful exercise of trade union activities (strike and protest march) contrary to the principles of freedom of association. The Committee notes that these persons have now been released unconditionally.c) The Committee notes that an agreement has been reached between the Government and the Trade Union Federation of Mineworkers of Bolivia, with a view to resolving the economic problems of the mining sector and decentralising COMIBOL through negotiation and consultation with the workers.d) However, the Committee expresses the hope that negotiations will be pursued actively and, given the large numbers of jobs that are at stake in this case, that trade union organisations will be consulted on the ways and means of resolving the problems of the tin mines and invited to participate in economic decisions that directly affect workers and their jobs.",-1,1986,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
44,".Three international labour confederations have presented a complaint against the Government of Bolivia alleging violations of freedom of association: the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in a telegram of  September l, the World Federation of Trade Unions in a letter of  September l, and the World Confederation of Labour in a telegram of  October l.
.The ILO sent the Government a telegram requesting its observations on the matter on  September l.
.The Government sent its observations in a telegram of  October l.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, l (No.), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, l (No.).
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) denounces the arrest of all the members of the executive committee of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB) and of the Trade Union Federation of Mine Workers of Bolivia (FSTMB), which took place on  September l at  p.m. The ICFTU explains that these arrests occurred when the union leaders were engaged in a hunger strike at the union offices to protest against economic measures adopted by the Government, that the arrests were carried out by the police and armed civilians and that the fate of the arrested union leaders is at present unknown. The ICFTU also claims that the Government imposed a state of siege and a curfew and that tanks driven by military personnel patrol the streets. The following union leaders were arrested: representing the COB: Juan Lechn, Executive Secretary, Walter Delgadillo, General Secretary, Angel Zaballa, Secretary for International Relations, and Alberto Echazu, Secretary for Internal Affairs; representing FSTMB: Victor Lpez, General Secretary and Justo Prez, Secretary for International Relations. The ICFTU requests the unconditional release of the arrested union leaders and the safeguarding of their physical well-being.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) likewise denounces the wave of serious violations of trade union rights perpetrated by the Bolivian Government. It explains that the Government brutally repressed a general strike called by the COB to protest against the deterioration of the standard of living resulting from an agreement between the Government and the Internatinal Monetary Fund, claiming that the Government declared the strike illegal and blocked the wages of strikers, and that the armed forces arrested , strikers, including Juan Lechn and Walter Delgadillo, who were taken to the El Alto International Airport, the Air Force's military base. The WFTU confirms that a state of emergency has been declared, which may last up to  days, as well as a curfew from  p.m. to  a.m., and indicates that the Minister of the Interior announced that anyone resisting the Government's decisions will be tried within  hours. The WFTU adds that the arrested persons have gone on a hunger strike, demanding that they be treated humanely by the police forces. The WFTU demands the immediate release of the imprisoned union leaders and strikers, the resumption of the COB's normal operations, and the respect of trade union rights in Bolivia.
.The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) also presented a formal complaint against the Government of Bolivia, alleging the flagrant violation of freedom of association and the arrest and banishment of the principal leaders of the COB and many activists. The WCL requests the Director-General to intervene in order to obtain an end of the measures imposed by the Bolivian authorities, under pressure from the IMF and other forces opposed to the labour movement within the country.
.In its reply of  October , the Government indicates that in accordance with articles  and  of the State's Political Constitution, it decreed a state of siege throughout the national territory in order to safeguard the constitutional order against internal turmoil that threatened the stability of the democratic process.
.According to the Government, these disturbances were caused by certain political elements, acting under the cover of trade unions. These elements sought to instigate uprisings and sedition. They conspired against national security, blocking transport and communications and isolating the country from the rest of the world. The state of siege declared by the Executive was ratified upon its imposition, and later authorised to continue by the National Congress. In the Government's opinion, these procedures confer complete legality on the measure. The Government also indicates that, since the disturbances have ceased and the country's political and social situation has returned to normal, no one is now under arrest or in prison.
.The Committee notes that this case concerns a wave of arrests in the Bolivian trade union movement following a general strike called on  September l for economic and social reasons, as well as the declaration of a state of siege.
.The Committee also notes the Government's contention that the strike in question paralysed the country by cutting it off from the rest of the world, and that the state of siege it had proclaimed was approved by Congress.
.In light of the seriousness of the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders and activists, their detention over a period of several days, and the banishment of a number of them for having participated in a strike, the Committee firmly recalls that the detention of trade union leaders for activities related to the exercise of their trade union rights is contrary to the principle of freedom of association, and that the banishment of union leaders for activities related to the exercise of their functions constitutes not only an infringement of human rights, but also interference in the activities of the organisation to which they belong.
.Nevertheless, since the Government claims that the country's political and social situation has returned to normal, and that no one is now under arrest or in prison, and since the complainants have not presented any new allegations, the Committee understands that the trade union situation has developed favourably. The Committee therefore expresses the hope that this trend will continue, and that through dialogue with all trade union forces in the country, Bolivia's social and economic problems will thus be able to be resolved in a climate of respect for civil liberties, within an industrial relations framework which has the confidence of the interested parties.
.The Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) In the light of the seriousness of the allegations concerning the arrest, detention and banishment of union leaders and activists for having participated in a strike, the Committee firmly recalls that the detention and banishment of trade union leaders for activities related to the exercise of their trade union rights constitute not only an infringement of human rights, but also interference in the activities of their organisations.b) Nevertheless, since the Government claims that the country's political and social situation has returned to normal, and that no trade unionist is now under arrest or in prison, the Committee understands that the trade union situation has developed favourably.c) It expresses the hope that Bolivia's social and economic problems will thus be able to be resolved in a climate of respect for civil liberties, within an industrial relations framework which has the confidence of the interested parties.",-1,1985,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

.The communication forwarded by the COB on  February  implies that the detention of the last two union leaders referred to was connected with the devaluation of the local currency by  per cant on  February , which led to a -hour strike convened by the clandestine COB.
.In its communication dated  March , the WCL sends a list of union leaders who have been arrested. These include Claudio Montao, Omar Fernndez, Oscar Lpez, Faner Rojas, Eduardo Ruiz, Carlos Ortega Pantoja, Javier Ledezma, Benigno Flores Medina, Lucio Valda, Ral Martinez Valda, Juan Carlos Romero, Jos Luis Lizeca, Juan Rodriguez Guagama, Jos Maria Gutirrez, David Aguilera, Mario Cullar Quinteros, Fermin Flores, Antonio Aguirre Mamani, Francisco Mamani, Fernando Rivera, Percy Paz Mndez, Pen Cartagena, Efrain Feguez, Ronald Romero, Enrique Velsquez Lpez and Zenn Barrientos. Finally, the complainants allege that on  April  a COB leader, Jos Maria Palacios Lpez, was arrested and his house ransacked by paramilitary groups.
.The Government states that Manuel Mamani, Marcelo Zuagua, Fusebio Chambi, Humberto Hervs, Edwin Prez, Victor Blacutt' Juan Saavedra, Rolando Flores, Nstor Urquieta, Arturo Jimnez, Simn Rada and Victor Villarroel were released after having been held in custody while their alleged participation in subversive acts was investigated.
.The Government adds that Filemn Escobar was remanded in custody because of his participation in subversive acts, as a result of which he opted for voluntary exile to Spain, and that Luis Lpez Altamirano - who has recently been released - was arrested for common law offences and not trade union activities and has been brought for trial before a regular court of justice.
.The Government points out, however, that of the persons referred to only Manuel Mamani, Marcelo Zuagua, Eusebio Chambi and Humberto Hervs are union leaders, a position which Luis Lpez Altamirano and Filemn Escobar ceased to hold in July  when the trade union executives were suspended by Supreme Decree No. .

In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that the persons concerned have now been released, the Committee can only recall that the preventive detention of union leaders and trade unionists involves a serious danger of infringement of trade union rights and may constitute a grave interference in trade union activities.,
.The Committee notes however that, according to the complainants, the persons concerned, together with Filemn Escobar and Luis Lpez Altamirano, were tortured while being held in custody, an aspect of the case to which the Government does not refer. Consequently, the Committee, recalling the importance which it attaches to the fact that preventive detention should he accompanied by a set of safeguards and limitations to ensure that it cannot be used for purposes other than that for which it is designed and, in particular, to give protection against torture and ill-treatment, urges the Government to order an investigation as soon as possible to establish whether they were in fact tortured and, if so, to punish those responsible and take steps to ensure that such incidents do not recur.
.With regard to the alleged detention of union leaders Filemn Escobar and Luis Lpez Altamirano, the Committee notes that, while the allegations suggest that these arrests were connected with the economic measures decreed by the Government which gave rise to a -hour strike convened by the clandestine COB, the Government states that Filemn Escobar and Luis Lpez Altamirano ceased to be trade union leaders in July , and that the former was remanded in custody for participating in subversive acts and the latter - since released pending trial - for common law offences. Because the complainants' version and the Government's reply are contradictory, the Committee is unable to reach definitive conclusions with regard to this allegation; it therefore requests the Government to indicate the specific grounds for the detention of Filemn Escobar and Luis Lpez Altamirano, to keep it informed of developments in their trial and to send it the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Luis Lpez Altamirano.
.The Committee further notes that Filemn Escobar has opted for voluntary exile to Spain. In this connection, the Committee does not exclude the possibility that his being remanded in custody for alleged participation in subversive acts may play or may have played a decisive role in Filemn Escorbar's decision. In these circumstances and since the information at its disposal is not sufficient for the Committee to determine whether or not the events which led to his preventive detention constitute an abuse of his trade union activities, the Committee wishes to recall the general principle that the forced exile of union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights, in addition to being an infringement of human rights, is in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.Finally, while noting that the union leader, Jos Maria Palacios Lpez has been released, the Committee observes that the Government has not answered the allegations concerning the ransacking of his home by paramilitary forces and the detention of  union leaders mentioned in the WCL's communication of  March . Consequently, the Committee asks the Government to send its observations and to indicate in particular as regards the last allegation, whether the union leaders are still under arrest, the grounds for their detention and any charges against them.

49,".The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) is contained in a communication dated  December . The Government for its part replied on  February .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL refers to the situation of the General Secretary of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB), Oscar Sanjins, who, following the seizure of power by the military, was expelled from Bolivia and, it alleges, persecuted.
.The person concerned, the WCL explains, was the Bolivian Workers' delegate to the th () Session of the International Labour Conference. In view of this the previous Government had granted him an airline ticket and subsistence allowances. Since then his own and his family's property have been seized on the grounds that he is held responsible for the expenses of his delegation on the occasion of the International Labour Conference.
.The WCL recalls that the legal department of the ILO bad on  September  addressed to the Permanent Mission of Bolivia in Geneva a letter and a copy of the certificate attesting that Oscar Sanjins and two other trade union colleagues of his were accredited to and participated in the th Session of the Conference, from  to  June . The complaint is accompanied by the above-mentioned documents certified by the Ambassador and also by the bill for the Geneva hotel where the Bolivian Workers' delegation to the Conference stayed from  to  June .
.The Government considers that the complaint concerns rather political than trade union motives as is the case - it states - as regards several former Bolivian leaders.
.According to the Government the alleged confiscation of the property of Oscar Sanjins is not due solely to the fact that he was a trade union leader.
.The Government explains that the National Directorate of the Administration and Supervision of Trade Union Funds (AFOPAL) informed the Ministry of Labour of the fact that the public funds supervisory organisation, the General Inspectorate of the Republic, had sent an account of expenses (No. //) to Mr. Oscar Sanjins Rodriguez. The latter had not in fact complied with the legally prescribed formalities regarding the rendering of accounts in cases where use is made of funds, whereas he had received a sum of , Bolivian pesos or the equivalent at the time of , United States dollars under the Venezuela-Bolivia agreement. This sum had been received by Mr. Oscar Sanjins for a journey to Geneva probably, the Government agrees, to participate in the th () Session of the International Labour Conference.
.The Government points out that under the provisions in force in Bolivia, any citizen who travels abroad with funds from the public Treasury or from bilateral agreements is obliged to account for his expenses and his activities in order to obtain a discharge in respect of the funds received if he fails to do so, embezzlement of public patrimony is presumed to have taken place and the proceedings provided for by law are instituted. The account of expenses is sent to the presumed debtor and the arrears are notified to the Registry but that does not mean that the debtor's property is seized. In the Government's view this is a simple preventive measure, traditional in such cases.
.Consequently the Government considers that the complaint is not receivable and that Mr. Oscar Sanjins would do better to account for the expenses, as all other Bolivian citizens do in these circumstances. According to the Government this case does not constitute any violation of freedom of association.
.In this case the Committee observes that according to the complainant the trade union leader representing the workers at the th Session of the International Labour conference in , Oscar Sanjins, now expelled from Bolivia, suffered confiscation of his own and his family's property on the grounds that he was, responsible for the expenses incurred by the delegation on the occasion of the conference. In the Government's view, however, the person concerned is obliged to account for the expenses which he incurred. Since he has not yet done so, an account of expenses was sent to him as debtor and the arrears were recorded in a Registry but that did not in any way mean that there had been a direct seizure of his property. In addition, the Government does not deny the allegation that the trade union leader, Oscar Sanjins, is in forced exile after his expulsion from the country following the seizure of power by the military.
.From the information at the disposal of the Committee, it would seem that the person concerned, the titular Workers' delegate to the International Labour Conference in , supplied in full the supporting papers relating to his mission in Geneva since the file includes, in particular, in addition to the Geneva hotel invoices from  to  June , the attestation of the legal department of the ILO with the seal of the Ambassador of the Permanent Mission of Bolivia in Geneva certifying that Oscar Sanjins Rodriguez, Armando Morales Gmez and Nicosio Choque Donaire were accredited as titular Workers' delegate of Bolivia and Bolivian, Workers' advisers, respectively, to the International Labour Conference of .
.In these circumstances, to the extent that other administrative formalities have still to be completed by the person concerned, the Committee considers that this ought not to necessitate its intervention but it expresses the strong hope that the formal problems which may remain in dispute will be resolved shortly. Indeed, the Committee has always considered it extremely important that no delegate to an ILO body or conference and no member of the Governing Body should be hindered in any way whatsoever from carrying out his mandate, or for having carried out such a mandate. Thus the Committee trusts that neither the person concerned, who is now in enforced exile, nor his family will suffer any prejudice resulting from the fact that he carried out his mandate during the  Session of the International Labour Conference.
.As regards the forced exile of the trade union leader, Oscar Sanjins, the Committee recalls that it has already had the opportunity in a recent case to remind the Government of Bolivia that the forced exile of trade unionists deprives them of the possibility of working in their country and separates them from their families. It is also an infringement of freedom of association in that it weakens the trade union movement by depriving it of its leaders. Consequently, the Committee considers that normal trade union activities can only be said to be fully restored when the trade union leaders now exiled are able, after returning to Bolivia, to stand again for trade union elections if they so wish, and perform the offices to which they may be elected.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) The Committee recalls that no delegate to an ILO body or conference should be hindered in any way whatsoever so as to prevent him from carrying out his mandate, or for having carried out his mandate.(b) Consequently, noting that the person concerned has forwarded supporting papers relating to his participation in the th Session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva in June  as titular Workers' delegate of Bolivia and to the expenses incurred by him and his delegation, the Committee trusts that neither the person concerned, who is new in enforced exile, nor his family will suffer any prejudice resulting from the fact that he carried out his mandate during the aforementioned session of the Conference.(c) As regards the forced exile of the trade union leader, Oscar Sanjins, the Committee again stresses that forced exile not only deprives trade unionists of the possibility of working in their country and joining their families, but infringes freedom of association in that it weakens the trade union movement by depriving it of its leaders. The Committee considers that any trade union leader now exiled should be able to return to Bolivia to perform the offices to which they might be elected.",-1,1981,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
50,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented complaints of infringement of trade union rights in Bolivia in communications dated  and  November , respectively. The Government sent its observations in a letter dated  January .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the ICFTU refers to a strike called by the Huanuni, Catavi, Siglo XX and San Jose miners for the purpose of obtaining restoration of trade union rights and better living and working conditions. The ICFTU states that the police arrested more than  trade union leaders.
.The WCL, for its part, alleges that more than  workers have been arrested since  November  and mentions the names of . It adds that the Government refuses to recognise the leadership of trade unions and has prohibited the right to strike. Lastly, it claims that the trade unionists arrested have been tortured.
.The Government considers that the complaints by the ICFTU and the WCL are a result of affirmations by former Bolivian trade union leaders oriented more towards political than trade union purposes. According to the Government, those leaders, in wishing to justify the economic assistance they receive from international Confederations, have attempted to distort the true picture of the Bolivian social process which the Confederations might have acquired from more objective information.
.As regards the dispute at the mines, the Government explains that, in the days preceding  November , persons with no trade union responsibility called illegal strikes in the Huanuni, Catavi, Siglo XX and San Jos mining undertakings. All of those mines belong to the Bolivian State. The strike movement caused losses of over  million American dollars. In those circumstances, the Government ordered the remand in custody of several unionised workers for infringement of certain provisions of Bolivian law. Subsequently, all of those workers were released.
.Lastly, with a view to solving the dispute and with the mediation of the Catholic Church, the Government carried out negotiations with the workers' legal representatives, resulting in the establishment of three Committees to discuss () resumption of trade union activities, () reopening of trade union radio broadcasts, and () an increase in wages and salaries. The Committees began to meet on  December . In conclusion, the Government expresses its astonishment at the use, of the terms ""torture, and ""persecution"" in describing the way in which labour disputes are settled in Bolivia.
.The Government attaches to its letter a newspaper cutting from Hoy (La Paz) dated  December , stating that the Government and the miners had decided that plant Committees would resume their activities at once, that trade unions would begin to operate again within  days and that federations would be set up within  days.
.This case relates to a strike called by miners in November . Although the Government, in its reply, refers to the political nature of the complaints, the Committee must note that the reasons giving rise to the strike were related to trade union demands (protection of trade union rights and better working conditions).
.The Committee must therefore recall that strikes are one of the essential and legitimate means available to workers for protecting their interests and consequently no one should be subjected to pressure of any kind for having launched or taken part in a strike for the purpose of protecting and promoting these interests.
.Concerning the measures of preventive detention taken by the Government, the Committee, while noting that the trade unionists have now all been released, must stress that the adoption of such measures against workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee notes that Committees have been set up to deal with each of the demands put forward by the miners with a view to settling the dispute. According to the information in the Committee's possession, an agreement has apparently been signed regarding the gradual resumption of the activities of trade union organisations (plant Committees, trade unions and federations, but apparently not Confederations). The Government does not supply any information on the results reached by the other Committees. Accordingly, the Committee would like to be kept informed of the findings of the other Committees set up for settling the dispute. The Committee also notes that a case concerning the general trade union situation on Bolivia (Case No. ) is still pending. It is the Committee's intention therefore to keep the resumption of activities of trade union organisations under review within the context of that case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) Regarding the Government's decision to declare the miners' strike illegal, the Committee recalls that strikes are one of the essential and legitimate means available to workers for protecting their interests.(b) Regarding the measures of preventive detention, the Committee, while noting that the trade unionists have been released, draws the Government's attention to the fact that the adoption of such measures against workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights.(c) Regarding the outcome of the dispute, the Committee notes that an agreement has been signed concerning the resumption of activities of trade union organisations. It requests the Government to keep it informed of the findings of the other Committees set up for solving the dispute.",-1,1981,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
51,".The Committee already examined this case at its meeting in February , when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government sent certain additional information in a communication dated  May .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still pending in this case concern a violent death and the arrest of trade union leaders.
.More specifically, the complainants alleged that Julio Cossi Meruvia, Secretary-General of the Joint Trade Union of Mine Workers of Catavi, died on  August  in a clinic in Oruro as a result of tortures inflicted on him, to the point of leaving him it a coma, by para-military forces of the special security service in the military headquarters of Uncia. The complainants also state that Julio Cossi Meruvia had been arrested on  August  simply because he had been elected leader by the workers whom he had represented worthily.
.The complainants also alleged that Dionisio Huaynapaco, a peasant leader of the Bolivian Workers Central (COB) as well as the miners Raimundo Paredes, Abraham Salas, Antonio Saravia, Humberto Blanco, Jos Fernando Espinoza, Carlos Gonzles, Roberto Calasich, Roberto Quisbert Navia, Victor Peralta Pios, Ricardo Garcia Camacho, Andrs Mamani and Lorenzo Oropeda were arrested for their participation in the strikes which took place at the beginning of August .
.At its March  Session, the Governing Body approved the interim conclusions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, and in particular, in view of the serious nature of the allegations concerning the death of Julio Cossi Meruvia after being tortured and the arrest of a peasant leader and  miners for their participation in strikes which took place in August , urged the Government to send its observations without delay.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government supplies no information on the alleged death of the trade union leader Julio Cossi Meruvia.
.Furthermore, it gives no information on the present situation of those persons who were arrested following their alleged participation in the strikes which took place in August , and whose names are supplied by the complainants. In this connection, however, the Government explains that it does not have enough information available at the moment to make specific observations concerning each of the former leaders or workers mentioned by the complainants. The Government states nevertheless that the participation of the persons concerned in the illegal strikes which took place in the mining districts of Huanuni, Siglo XX, Catavi and San Jos at the beginning of August  must be viewed as subversive activity in as far as the strikes in question were not declared in accordance with the procedure set forth in sections  and  of the Labour Code and that acts had been committed in violation of the right to freedom of work.
.Firstly, the Committee notes with keen regret that the Government does not supply any information on the alleged death of Julio Cossi Meruvia in a clinic of Oruro after being tortured. The Committee therefore urges the Government to supply the most precise information possible on the circumstances in which this person died and to confirm that his death did occur. In this connection, the Committee insists on the need for an independent judicial inquiry to establish the facts and assess responsibilities.
.As regards the arrest of  persons following their participation in the strikes at the beginning of August  in the mining districts of Huanuni, Siglo XX, Catavi and San Jos, and whose names have been supplied by the complainants, the Committee notes the very general statement by the Government that the strikes were illegal and deemed to be of a subversive nature. The Committee notes in particular that, according to the Government, the strikers did not respect sections  and  of the labour Code and that acts were committed against the right to freedom of work.
.For its part, the Committee has examined sections  and  of the Labour Code and notes that these provisions concern conciliation and arbitration in labour disputes. It notes that the provisions relating to arbitration contained in Part X of the labour Code allow considerable restrictions to be placed on the use of strikes, and even their prohibition. In particular, section  stipulates that a strike movement is illegal until all means of conciliation and arbitration have been exhausted; section  establishes that an arbitration award shall be binding if the Executive so decides by a special order; section  requires e three-quarters majority of the number of workers actually employed before a strike can be declared and section  establishes penalty of imprisonment of between two and six months for those persons who commit acts against the freedom of employment of those trade unionists or workers who do not approve of the strike.
.The Committee has pointed out on many occasions' that the preventive detention of trade unionists on the ground that breaches of the law may have taken place in connection with a strike involves a serious danger of infringement of trade union rights. The Committee stresses once again that the right of workers and workers' organisations to strike is one of the essential means for the promotion and defence of their occupational interests. The provisions established by legislation concerning the legality of a strike should therefore be reasonable and must not constitute a restriction placed on the possible recourse to strike except as regards essential services understood in the strict sense of the term, i.e. services whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population. However, the Committee cannot consider that the mining sector as a whole to which those workers who have allegedly been imprisoned since August  belong is an essential service in which the workers' right to promote and defend their interests by recourse to strikes could be prohibited. The Committee recalls furthermore that the action of peaceful strike pickets should not be impeded by the authorities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the firm hope that those persons whose names have been supplied by the complainants will, if they are still imprisoned, be released as rapidly as possible. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this matter.
.The Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) As regards the allegation concerning the death of Julio Cossi Meruvia after being tortured during his detention, the Committee notes with keen regret that the Government has not replied. It urges the Government once again to supply the most precise information possible on the circumstances of the death of this person if it is true that he is in fact dead.(b) As regards the allegation concerning the imprisonment of thirteen workers for their participation in strikes in the mining districts in August , and whose names have been supplied by the complainants, the Committee expresses the firm hope that, given the importance which it attaches to the right of workers to strike as one of the essential means of promoting and defending their occupational interests, these persons will, if they are still imprisoned, be released as rapidly as possible. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this matter.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the Trade Union Federation of Bolivian Miners (FSTMB), the. World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) dated  August,  and  September,  October and  August , respectively. The COB sent further information in communications of  August and  October , and the WFTU in communications of  September and  October . The Government replied in a communication of  January .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that Julio Cosso Meruvia, Secretary-General of the Joint Trade Union of Mineworkers of Catavi, died on  August  in a clinic in Oruro, as a result of the brutal tortures inflicted on him to the point of leaving him in a coma by paramilitary forces of the special security service in the military headquarters of Uncia. The complainants state that Julio Cosso Meruvia had been arrested on  August  and that his only ""crime"" was to have been elected leader by the working class and to have represented it worthily.
.The complainants also allege that Edgardo Vzquez Ursula Goyzueta, members of the executive Committee of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), were arrested by pare-military forces on  August  in the region of  Alto and charged by the Government with terrorism, which means that their lives are in danger. The complainants draw attention, moreover, to the imprisonment of Dionisio Huayrapaco, a peasant leader",-1,1981,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
52,"and member of the executive Committee of the COB, as well as of the miners Raimundo Paredes, Abraham Sales, Antonio Saravia, Humberto Blanco, Jos Fernando Espinoza, Carlos Gonzalez, Roberto Calasich, Roberto Quisbert Navia, Victor Peralta Rios, Ricardo Garcia Camacho, Andrs Mamani and Lorenzo Oropeda, all imprisoned for their participation in the strikes which took place at the beginning of August .
.Finally, the complainants allege that Guido Arze, Relations Secretary of the Central of Departmental Workers of Santa Cruz, was detained by the police on  September , which they consider to constitute a violation of the ILO Conventions.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that, according to information provided by the ministry of the Interior, the former leaders Guido Arze and Edgardo Vzquez are at liberty and that Ursula Goyzueta has never been detained.
.The Committee takes note of the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply, in particular the letter's statement that Ursula Goyzueta, a member of the executive Committee of the COB, has never been detained.
.The Committee also notes the Government's statement that the trade union leaders Guido Arze and Edgardo Vzquez are at liberty. In this respect, the Committee notes that while it could be inferred from the tenor of the Government's reply that the trade union leaders mentioned had in fact been detained, the complainants have not emphasised the existence of specific anti-trade union reasons for the detentions in question. In these circumstances, the Committee can only recall generally in the absence of details on this question that the detention of trade union leaders, trade unionists or workers for activities related to the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee notes further that the Government has not replied to the other allegations (the death of the trade union leader, Julio Cossio Meruvia, as a result of torture inflicted during his detention; the detention of the peasant leader of the COB, Dionisio Huaynapaco, and of the miners Raimundo Paredes, Abraham Salas, Antonio Saravia, Humberto Blanco, Jos Fernando Espinoza, Carlos Gonzlez, Roberto Calasich, Roberto Quisbert Navia, Victor Peralta Rio, Ricardo Garcia Camacho, Andrs Mamani and Lorenzo Oropeda, for their participation in the strikes that took place at the beginning of August ). Consequently, the Committee in view of the serious nature of these allegations, urges the Government to send its observations promptly on these matters.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) With regard to the detention of the trade union leaden, Ursula Goyzueta, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, she was never detained.(b) Concerning the detention of the trade union leaders Guido Arze and Edgardo Vzquez, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that they are at liberty, and recalls generally, it the absence of specific details as to the reasons for the arrests, that the detention of trade union leaders, trade unionists or workers for activities relating to the exercise f trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) Regarding the other allegations (death of the trade union leader, Julio Cossio Meruvia, as a result of torture inflicted during his detention; the detention of the peasant leader of the COB, Dionisio Huaynapaco, and of the miners Raimundo Paredes, Abraham Salas, Antonio Saravia, Humberto Blanco, Jos Fernando Espinoza, Carlos Gonzlez, Roberto Calasich, Roberto Quisbert Navia, Victor Peralta Rios, Ricardo Garcia Camacho, Andrs Mamani and Lorenzo Oropeda, for their participation in the strikes that took place at the beginning of August ), the Committee, in view of the serious nature of these allegations, urges the Government to send its observations promptly.",-1,1981,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
53,".The Committee already examined this case at its November  and February  Sessions, when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then the complainant organisations have sent the ILO the following communications: the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), communications dated  April and  June ; the Latin American Federation of Farm Workers (FCLA), a communication dated  June ; the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), communications dated  June,  June and  July  and  January ; the external co-ordination secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), communications dated  June and  July ; the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), a communication dated  July ; and the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), a communication dated  July .
.The Government, for its part, sent observations in letters dated  July ,  and  January,  and  February .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints presented in this case related to repressive action taken against the trade union movement following the change of government on  July . The allegations mainly concerned the violent death of certain trade unionists, including Gualberto Vega Yapura, a leader of the Trade Union Federation of Bolivian Mineworkers, and the arrest of numerous trade union leaders and militants. The external co-ordination secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers had supplied a list of more than  persons arrested, which was transmitted to the Government for its observations. The complaints also related to the dissolution by administrative authority of the Bolivian Central of Workers and almost all the trade union organisations. Following a mission carried out on the spot by a representative of the Director-General in October , the Committee proceeded to an initial examination of the case in November . Subsequently, the Committee received additional complaints concerning the death of several trade unionists and the arrest of trade union leaders and militants.
.At its March  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, expressed its concern at the gravity of the allegations which continued to be brought to its knowledge. It recalled that a free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected. Concerning the specific allegations of the complainants, the Governing Body requested the Government to continue its investigation into the death of Gualberto Vega and to supply information on the circumstances surrounding the death of certain trade union leaders, including Artemio Amargo, on  January . The Governing Body also requested the Government to supply as precise information as possible on the fate of Gregorio Andrade, a peasant leader, Walter Delgadillo, a leader of the COB, Pablo Copa, a leader of the Federation of Miners, and Gloria Ardaya, alleged to have been arrested in January . Lastly, as regards the revision of the trade union legislation, the Governing Body requested the Government to continue to keep it informed of the progress made in this connection, and expressed the firm hope that the legislation so amended would be in full conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Bolivia, and would lead rapidly to the restoration of freedom of association in the country.
.In its communication of  April , the WCL supplies particulars about the circumstances in which Gregorio Andrade, a peasant leader and member of the COB executive Committee, was arrested on  January  after his arrest, he is said to have been held in the Political Department prison in La Paz and to have disappeared after  March . The WCL also refers to the disappearance, since  July , of Ren Sanchez, secretary of the Federation of Industrial Workers of La Paz lastly, the WCL states that numerous workers were arrested following trade union reactions to the economic measures adopted by the Government in mid-January , including the trade union leader, Bernab Quiroz, who was killed and whose corpse was handed over to his family by the army.
.The communications sent by the complainant organisations in June and July  concern the arrest of Genaro Flores, secretary-general of the COB for farm workers and general co-ordinator of the COB underground. According to the complainants, Genaro Flores belonged to a group of  trade union leaders who were attacked on  June  by paramilitary groups and then arrested. Seriously wounded by bullets in the spine, Genaro Flores was transported to the police hospital in La Paz. Fearing that his life was in danger, the complainant organisation requested the Director-General to intervene so that. Mr. Flores would be allowed to leave Bolivia for a country where he could receive care.
.Lastly, the external co-ordination secretariat of the COB alleges that Marcelo Quezada, a journalist of the COB magazine, was arrested in La Paz on  June .
.Regarding the death of the trade union leaders, Gualberto Vega and Artemio Camargo, the Government regrets to confirm in its communication of  January  that these two persons died, on  July  and  January , respectively.
.The Government also states that Pablo Copa, Walter Delgadillo and Gloria Ardaya have gone into exile in different countries of Europe.
.As regards the position of Genaro Flores, the Government, after pointing out in its letter of  July  that this trade union leader had been wounded by the police when attempting to escape and was receiving proper care, states in, its communication of  January  that he is now in exile in Europe.
.Regarding the trade union situation in general, in its letter of  January  the Government states that it concluded an agreement with the mineworkers' representatives on  December , with the Catholic church acting as mediator, as part of the efforts being made to bring about, through dialogue, a gradual return to normal trade union activities by sectors. The Government supplies the text of the agreement in question along with its communication of  February .
.The Bolivian workers' right of association is fully recognised under that, agreement. Consequently, like the mineworkers, and immediately after hem, other workers will re-establish their trade union organisations according to a sectoral timetable fixed by the Ministry of Labour.
.The mineworkers will set up their trade unions and federations within  and  days, respectively, from the date of the agreement. The National Directorate of Bolivian workers will be re-established within  days when all of the sector have organised their federations and Confederations.
.Pending the implementation of his timetable, the workers will be represented in their relations with the employers by plant Committees democratically elected in each sector of activity. In this connection the Government has adopted Resolution No. / dated  January  which sets out the organisation of the elections, prescribes that there will only be one plant Committee per undertaking and that candidates for these Committees shall fulfil certain conditions, in particular, to be born in Bolivia, to have worked at least one year in the undertaking concerned and not to have been convicted of any criminal charge. In addition, negotiations on, wages and the reopening of broadcasting stations will be resumed with the workers' representatives starting on  January . Lastly, the Government will issue rules for the elections to plant Committees according to a timetable established in the agreement of  December . Decree No.  to dissolve trade union leadership and Decree No.  to appoint ""labour relations officers"" have also been repealed.
.In, its communication of  February , the Government states that the workers are presently standing for election to the plant Committees in an atmosphere of freedom. To this moment  of these Committees have been recognised.
.The Committee takes note of the general development of the trade union situation in Bolivia. It must however note with regret that the Government has replied only partially to the allegations made by the complainants about specific events.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information about the circumstances surrounding the death of Gualberto Vega and Artemio Camargo or replied to the allegations concerning the death of eight trade union leaders who, like Artemio Camargo, are said to have been shot down in La Paz on  January . In these circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the violent deaths of these trade unionists. It must recall the importance in such cases of carrying out at once an impartial and full inquiry to clarify the facts and determine responsibilities. The atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue, which the Government states it wishes to restore, may be created more easily once the responsibilities of officials concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.Regarding the four trade unionists alleged to have been arrested in January , the Committee notes that three of them have been forced into exile in this connection, the Committee tresses that the forcing",-1,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
54,"of trade unionists into exile, although a lass severe measure than detention, deprives them of the possibility of working in their country and joining their families. It is also an infringement of freedom of association in that it weakens the trade union movement by depriving it of its leaders. Moreover, normal trade union activities in the country can only be said to be fully restored when the trade union leaders now exiled are able, after returning to Bolivia, to stand again for trade union elections and perform the offices to which they may be elected.
.The Government has not supplied information about the fourth trade union leader, Gregorio Andrade, alleged to have been arrested in January  and reported to be missing since March . Non has it replied to the further allegations made by the complainants concerning the arrest of Marcelo Quezada, COB journalist, the disappearance of Perz Sanchez, secretary of the Federation of Industrial workers of La Paz, and the death of Bernab Quiroz, a trade union leader.
.Concerning the situation of Genaro Flores, a COB leader, the Committee has been informed of the approaches which the Director-General made to the Government in order that Mr. Flores could receive care abroad. The Committee notes that Mr. Flores was able to leave Bolivia for Europe where he is now living in exile.
.Regarding the trade union situation in general, the Committee notes that under an agreement concluded with the mineworkers' representatives a timetable has been established for a return to normal trade union activities. It also notes that the Government will organise plant Committee elections, thus putting an end to the functions of the ""labour relations officers"" introduced in August  to represent the workers. However, the Committee observes that the ministerial resolution relating to these plant Committees contains several regulations which are contrary to the principles of freedom of association, in particular the obligation of only one Committee per undertaking and the various conditions of eligibility. Finally the Committee notes that Decrees Nos.  and , on which comments had been made, have been repealed.
.The Committee expresses the hope that the agreement will lay the necessary groundwork for a return to normal trade union activities on the basis of legislation and practice consistent with Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Bolivia. The Committee also considers it would be useful if the Government would submit the draft of any new legislation prepared by it to the ILO for comments, as has been done in several other cases and as the Government stated its intention of doing during the direct contacts.
.The Committee would like to be kept informed of developments in the situation, in particular the implementation of the agreement concluded with the mineworkers' representatives as it bears on the establishment of local trade unions and federations and Confederations. The Committee would also like to obtain clarifications about the scope of that agreement, in particular the possibility available to workers of organising a national Confederation of their own choosing.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) Regarding the violent death of trade union leaders, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information about the circumstances in which those deaths took place. It considers that the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue may be created more easily when the responsibilities of officials concerned have been established and the persons who abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.(b) Regarding the trade unionists arrested in January , the Committee notes that three of them have been forced into exile. It stresses that forced exile not only deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and joining their families but constitutes an infringement of freedom of association in that it weakens the trade union movement by depriving it of its leaders. The Committee considers that the trade union leaders now exiled should be able to return to Bolivia and to perform the trade union offices to which they may be elected.(c) Regarding the further allegations made by the complainants, the Committee requests the Government for its observations on the disappearance of Gregorio Andrade and Ren Sanchez, the death of Bernab Quiroz and the arrest of Marcelo Quezada.(d) Regarding the restoration of normal trade union activities, the Committee notes that Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  to deprive trade union leadership of their office and introduce labour relations officers have been repealed. It expresses the hope that the agreement concluded between the Government and the mineworkers' representatives will lay the necessary groundwork for a return to normal trade union activities on the basis of legislation and practice consistent with Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Bolivia. It suggests that the Government, according to its stated intention expressed during the direct contacts, should submit to the ILO any bills that may be prepared, far comments. The Committee requests the Government to supply information about the implementation and scope of the agreement (establishment of trade union organisations and the possibility of establishing a national Confederation of labour)
.The Committee already examined this case at its session of November  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. Since that meeting or shortly before, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the Miners' International Trade Union Federation (MITUF), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL) presented additional allegations in communications dated  October and  November  and , ,  and  January  respectively. The Government furnished its observations in communications dated  and  December  and  February .
.Bolivia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints presented in this case concerned the repression suffered by the trade union movement following the change of government on  July . The allegations principally concerned the violent death of certain trade union leaders, including Gualberto Vega and the many detentions of trade union leaders and activists. Thus the external co-ordination secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers supplied a list of more than  persons who had been arrested, which had been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The allegations also concerned the dissolution by administrative authority of the Bolivian Central of Workers and almost all the trade union organisations. For its part, the ICFTU denounced the arrests of the members of a humanitarian mission which had been sent to Bolivia and the confiscation of $, which had been destined for assistance to the families of the imprisoned trade unionists.
.At its session in November , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted that a representative of the Director-General had visited the country to examine the trade union situation on the spot, jointly with the Government. The Governing Body expressed its concern at the gravity of certain allegations and recalled as a general principle that a truly free and independent trade union movement could only develop where fundamental human rights were respected. Furthermore, the Governing Body urged the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the death of trade union leaders and to communicate information on the precise circumstances of these deaths if it were true that these persons were no longer alive. It also noted that certain persons mentioned by the complainants had been released but that a significant number of other persons had either been restricted to specified towns or exiled.
.As a consequence, the Governing Body recalled the principles and considerations to which it was committed concerning measures of arrest, restriction to specified towns and exile, and in particular, the importance of appropriate judicial safeguards, and it asked the Government to supply information on the present position of the other trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. It also called the Government's particular attention to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Bolivia, according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority and it expressed the hope that the Bolivian trade unions would soon be returned to their previous status, that the proposed new legislation would be in full conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  and that in revising the trade union legislation the Government would, as it had indicated was its intention, seek the advice and co-operation of the ILO. It requested the Government to supply information on the progress made in the adoption of this legislation and on the evolution of the trade union situation. The Governing Body noted furthermore that the members of the ICFTU who were arrested during a mission to Bolivia had been released and expelled but, in the absence of observations from the Government on this point, it had requested it to provide",-1,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
55,"information on the alleged confiscation of a sum of money carried by members of the mission.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that on  November  there were no more political prisoners and arrested trade unionists in prison. Since then, the Committee has received complaints relating to the death of nine persons, including several trade unionists, and to the arrest of several trade union leaders and active trade unionists.
.Firstly, the Committee must note with regret that the inquiries carried out by the Government have not led to the identification of Gualberto Vega. According to the allegations coming from several complainant organisations, it would concern Gualberto Vega Yepura, leader of the Federation of Trade Unions of Mine Workers in Bolivia, representative of the Catavi district, who is said to have died on  July  during attacks by the armed forces. Due to the particular seriousness of this allegation, the Committee considers it necessary that the investigations continue with a view to clarifying the facts and it requests the Government to keep it informed on this point.
.Furthermore, in November , the Committee had expressed the hope that the Bolivian trade unions would be returned to their previous situation and that the proposed new legislation would be in conformity with ILO standards. In this connection, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates its declarations that the Bolivian trade union movement is being organised on the basis of workers' Committees and that the Government gives its assurances that account will be taken of the advice and co-operation of the ILO when its social legislation is revised. The Committee can only insist on the importance of the right of workers to be able to establish and join organisations of their own choosing. It wishes to request the Government to continue to furnish information on developments occurring in the legislative situation.
.In addition, the Committee notes the assurances given by the Government that the sum of money confiscated from the ICFTU delegation will very soon be returned.
.As concerns the allegations of the WCL that , trade unionists employed in the civil service were dismissed, the Committee wishes to point out, while noting the very general observations provided by the Government, that the authorities should not, even during times of political upheaval, undertake anti-trade union activities and should not in particular dismiss trade unionists working in the public sector. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures with a view to allowing the workers concerned to be reinstated in their jobs.
.In the absence of comments by the Government on the new allegations concerning the death of nine leaders of the opposition, including Artemio Camargo, and the arrest of trade unionists including Gregorio Andrade, Walter Delgadillo, Pablo Copa and Gloria Ardaya, the Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on these aspects of the case.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee would like firstly to express its concern at the gravity of the allegations which continue to be presented to it and to recall that the free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected.The Committee must note with regret that the inquiries carried out by the Government have not led to the identification of the leader of the Federation of Miners, Gualberto Vega, whose death has been alleged. The Committee requests the Government to continue its investigations and to keep it informed on this point. As regards the deaths of the trade union leaders including Artemio Camargo, which allegedly occurred on  January , the Committee urges the Government to provide information on the circumstances surrounding these deaths.The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the most exact information available on the fate of Gregorio Andrade, the peasant leader, Walter Delgadillo, leader of the BCW, Pablo Copa, leader of the Federation of Miners, and Gloria Ardaya, who were allegedly arrested in January .It notes that the sum of money confiscated from the ICFTU delegation will very soon be returned.Regarding the allegations of dismissals of trade unionists in the public service, the Committee wishes to point out that the authorities should not, even during times of political upheaval, undertake anti-trade union activities. It requests the Government to take measures with a view to allowing the workers concerned to be reinstated in their jobs.Finally, as regards the revision of the trade union legislation, the Committee requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of progress made in this connection, and it expresses the firm hope that the legislation so amended will be fully in conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Bolivia, and will rapidly permit the restoration of freedom of association in the country.
.By communications dated ,  and  July  respectively, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented complaints alleging grave violations of trade union rights in Bolivia.
.In addition, the ICFTU, the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions (IFFTU) and the CPUSTAL sent information in communications dated , ,  and  July, and the Miners' International Federation and the WCL sent communications on  and  August. Finally, up-to-date lists of persons who had been arrested were transmitted by the WCL on  September and by the External Co-ordination Secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers on  October. On  September the ICFTU sent a telegram containing further allegations.
.In view of the seriousness of the allegations, the Director-General, in conformity with the procedure established by the Governing Body and with the agreement of the Chairman of the Governing Body Committee on Freedom of Association, sent the Bolivian Government a telegram on  July asking it to receive a senior official of the ILO to discuss the trade union situation on the spot. The Government agreed on  August, and this mission was carried out from  to  October by Mr. Ian Lagergren, Deputy Chief of the International Labour Standards Department, accompanied by Mr. Daniel de Patoul, ILO associate expert. Since then, the Government has supplied its observations in a communication dated  October  and transmitted to the ILO on  November .
.In essence, the present case is examined in the light both of the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during his mission, and of the above-mentioned observations of the Government.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisations have given a general picture of the harsh repression suffered by the trade union movement following the military coup d'Etat on  July .
.In particular, they expressed their profound concern at the reported murders of certain trade union leaders and the many detentions of trade union leaders and activists, the torture and maltreatment of detainees, the occupation and demolition of the headquarters of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), the dissolution of trade unions, the confiscation of their assets, and their fears as to the fate of trade union leaders Juan Lechin, Executive Secretary of the COB, and Simn Reyes, a leader of the Miners' Federation. A number of organisations requested the sending of a direct contacts mission and the intervention of the ILO to obtain the release of the imprisoned trade union leaders.
.According to the ICFTU communication of  July,  trade union leaders had been shot and  active members of the COB arrested.
.In its communication of  July the IFFTU denounces the prohibition by the Government of two teachers' unions (rural and urban).
.The WCL communication of  August alleges that the leader of the Miners' Federation, Gualberto Vega, has been murdered and that  persons have bees arrested; a list of these, which was supplied by the External Co-ordination Secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers has been conveyed to the Government. According to the WCL, the number of arrests exceeds ,,  of them immediately after the change of government. Still according to the WCL, the Minister of the Interior, Luis Arce Gmez, admits that  persons have been arrested and that other arrests are still being made. In particular, the complainant organisation condemns the use of tanks and aviation in the mining areas where Gualberto Vega is said to have been killed; it expresses concern at the ill-treatment inflicted on Juan Lechin and Simn Reyes and at the hardships suffered by the wounded, who, when taken to hospital, are said to have been kidnapped and sent to camps of the General Staff.
.CL  October the External Co-ordination. Secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers sent an up-dating of the lists, which has also been communicated",-1,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
56,"to the Government.
.In its telegram of  September, the ICFTU referred to the arrest and maltreatment of the members of a humanitarian mission which it had sent to Bolivia. During this mission the authorities are said to have confiscated $, which had been destined for assistance to the families of the imprisoned trade unionists.
.The representative of the Director-General had talks in La Paz with Colonel Luis Arce Gmez, Minister of the interior and acting Minister for Foreign Affairs; General Augusto Caldern Miranda, Minister of Labour; Mgr. Jorge Manrique, Archbishop of La Paz; Dr. Armin E. Kobel, head of the international Committee of the Red Cross delegation to Bolivia; and Mr. Ramn Mantilla, representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He also met the President (Mr. M. Prez Monasteros) and the executive secretary (Mr. Fernando Moscoso) of the Association of Private Employers of Bolivia. He referred to the allegations received at the ILO, and drew attention to the generally accepted principles governing freedom of association, and inquired as to the Government's intentions. He also asked to meet the trade union leaders Juan Lechin and Simn Reyes.
.The Minister of the Interior stated that the suspension of trade union rights and civil liberties had become necessary as a temporary measure. The Bolivian trade union movement, whose major concern should be the protection of the economic and social interests of the Bolivian workers, had, he said, departed from its proper course and had become a purely political movement, manipulated by its leaders to serve their own political interests. Trade union rights and civil liberties were soon to be restored, however, and the Government was engaged in a reorganisation of the trade union movement designed to ensure that it would serve trade union instead of political purposes. A number of extremist trade union leaders would be expelled from the country, but other trade unionists held in detention would soon be released. It was the Government's wish that no trade unionist should remain in detention, and it agreed that the representative of the Director-General should meet Mr. Juan Lechin and Mr. Simon Reyes.
.The Minister of Labour supplied copies of Presidential Decrees Nos.  of  July and  of  August . The first of those provides for the dissolution of existing trade unions and the restructuring of the Bolivian trade union movement; the second provides for the appointment of workers' representatives (""relacionadores laborales"") to carry out certain trade union functions pending the establishment of a new trade union organisation. He also provided detailed statistics of work stoppages in different sectors of the Bolivian economy during the period June  to June ; these, according to the Minister, were politically motivated, had a disastrous effect on the country's economy and hence justified the action the Government had found it necessary to take. However, he gave assurances that the reorganisation of the Bolivian trade unions would take place with due regard to the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Bolivia, and that the Government would seek the advice and cooperation of the ILO when revising trade union legislation. In respect of two of the allegations the Minister explained, firstly, that while it was true that the headquarters building of the COB was being demolished, this demolition was not directed against the trade unions as such but formed part of a major cleaning-up operation affecting several buildings in the most important avenue in La Paz. New premises would be provided for the reorganised trade unions. Secondly, the allegation that trade union funds and assets had been confiscated was false. These funds and assets had merely been ""frozen"" to make sure that they were preserved, and would be handed over to the new unions once they had been set up.
.The representative of the Director-General met Mr. Juan Lechin in his room at the military hospital in La Paz where he was recovering from an operation. He was accompanied by Dr. Daniel Salamanca, Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of the interior, his request that the interview should take place in the absence of any witnesses having been turned down. However, Mr. Lechin did not appear to be in any way intimidated by the presence of a representative of the authorities. He indicated that he warmly appreciated the intervention of the ILO. He stated that his conditions of detention were reasonably good. He has access to, newspapers and a television set was installed in his room. His brother visited him almost daily. At no stage during his detention had he been subjected to any kind of torture.
.Mr. Simn Reyes was in detention at the Department of Political Order (DOP). The interview with him took place in the prison governor's office, again in the presence of Dr. Salamanca. Mr. Reyes also stated that his conditions of detention were reasonably good and that he had at no time been tortured or subjected to other ill-treatment. Clearly, however, Reyes was a very depressed man, much less talkative and much more subdued than Lechn, although it is difficult to judge whether this was due to differences of personality or to differences in their conditions of detention.
.The representative of the Director-General also met the President and the Executive Secretary of the Association of Private Employers of Bolivia. The President (Mr. M.P. Monasterios) considered that the dissolution of the existing trade unions had become inevitable. Frequent and irresponsible work stoppages, where trade union leaders manipulated the unions to serve their own political purposes, had had disastrous effects on the economy and on the political stability of the country. The situation was, however, now calm and under control, and it was to be hoped that harmonious industrial relations, untinged by political considerations, would be established with the new trade unions that were to be created.
.Discussions with the representatives of the international Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR and the Archbishop of La Paz made it possible to establish the whereabouts and the current situation with regard to a number of persons specifically mentioned in the complaints (see appendix). In all too many cases, however, the representative of the Director-General states that identification proved impossible since the names provided were incomplete. The delegation of the international Committee of the Red Cross travels freely throughout the country. The head of the Red Cross delegation, Dr. Kobel, undertook to inform any detained trade unionist he might encounter (and he had already seen quite a number) of the ILO's mission to Bolivia and the efforts being undertaken on their behalf.
.Finally, it should be mentioned that the representatives of the UNHCR and the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (ICEN) with whom the representative of the Director General spoke in La Paz declared their readiness to assist with the material arrangements for the departure from Bolivia of those trade unionists and the members of their families who had to leave the country.
.In its communication of  October , transmitted on  November, the Government states that the complaints are totally unfounded. It adds that they have at no time been proved and evidence a deliberate desire to damage the prestige of the Bolivian Government for political reasons.
.The Government indicates that at the present time the majority of the trade unionists who were in detention have been released or exiled at their own request. In other cases, after the subversive activities of the persons concerned had been proved, and after these persons had indicated that it was their wish to remain in Bolivia, it was decided to restrict them to specified towns in accordance with article , paragraph  of the Political Constitution which provides that, if the preservation of public order necessitates the removal of suspects elsewhere, they may by order be restricted to a departmental or provincial capital; however, persons restricted, prosecuted or arrested on such grounds may not be refused a passport if they request it in order to leave the country, and the authorities must grant them the guarantees necessary for this purpose.
.As regards the allegations that limitations have been placed on trade union freedom, the Government states that it has not placed any impediment in the way of the free exercise of trade union rights. It adds that it has merely by order ended the term of office of all trade union leaders because the offices in question had been transformed into profit-making institutions and instruments for permanent disturbances. The Bolivian trade union movement was subject to the orders of a few leaders who received guidelines and instructions from abroad. In the Government's view, the workers themselves were aware that the trade unions could not be turned into centres of political agitation and means of illegal enrichment. The Government adds that it will respect the social gains and rights which are recognised by the law and will authorise the free exercise of trade union activities.
.In order to keep the means of dialogue with the workers open, the Government has authorised the formation of groups of ""labour relations agents"" democratically elected by workers' Committees",-1,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
57,"to represent them in negotiations and in disputes.
.The Government next refers to the large-scale politicisation of the trade unions which had resulted in innumerable strikes and work stoppages over the last  months, with resulting damage to the economy of the country. In. support, the Government supplies a statistical table on the labour disputes over this period.
.The Government denies the allegations concerning the demolition of the trade union premises. It states that, on the contrary, it has decided to erect a modern building which will replace the dilapidated premises of the COB and will serve not only as the headquarters of this organisation but also for the benefit of all workers thanks to the inclusion of several levels of car parking.
.In an appendix to its communication, the Government supplies information on  persons who had been mentioned by the complainants. It appears from this information that  of them are restricted to a specified town,  have not been detained,  are in exile,  are at liberty and  has died in Geneva where he had been living for score years. The Committee noted that the names largely corresponded to those communicated by the complainants.
.The allegations made in the present case refer to the violent deaths of trade union leaders and the arrest of large numbers of trade unionists, to the dissolution of the Bolivian Central of workers and of the existing trade unions, and to the measures taken against the members of an international trade union mission.
.Before considering each of the questions raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to express its deep concern at the gravity of certain allegations, and to recall as a general principle that a truly free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected.
.The Committee observes in the first place that the Government has supplied no information regarding the death of fifteen trade union leaders who are said to have been shot, nor on the death of the Miners' Federation leader, Gualberto Vega. In this connection the Committee can only urge the Government to supply its observations on these allegations and detailed information on the precise circumstances of the death of these trade union leaders if it is true that they are no longer alive.
.As to the allegations concerning the arrests of trade unionists, the Committee notes that according to the Government the majority of these persons have not been arrested. It appears however from the information received that a significant number of them have been restricted to specified towns and that a few have been exiled. The Government has given no information on the precise grounds for these measures. Finally, some persons have been released.
.As the Committee has already had occasion to point out in earlier cases, although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the absence of guarantees of due process of law may lead to abuses and allow trade union officials to be penalised pursuant to decisions based on groundless accusations. It may also create a climate of insecurity and fear which may be prejudicial to the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has often drawn attention to the risks of violations of trade union rights involved in the detention of trade unionists against whom no grounds for accusation are subsequently found; accordingly, the Government should take steps to forestall the risk of unjustified arrests. The Committee has also considered that the granting to a trade unionist of his freedom on condition that he leaves the country although a less harsh measure is not compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee has taken note of the Government's statement that suspects who are restricted, prosecuted or arrested can, at their request, be exiled. In this connection, the Committee must emphasise, as it has in the past, that the granting of his freedom to a trade unionist on condition that he leaves the country, although a less drastic measure than detention, cannot be considered compatible with the exercise of trade union rights. Similarly, restriction to a specified town, which also deprives trade unionists of the opportunity to carry on their trade union activities, is also a measure incompatible with the normal enjoyment of the right of association, Such restrictions should also be subject to appropriate judicial safeguards operating within a reasonable time and in particular to the protection of the right of the persons concerned to a fair trial as soon as possible.
.In addition, the Committee wishes to ask the Government to supply information on the present position of the other persons mentioned in the complaints.
.The Committee has taken note of the contents of Presidential Decree No.  of  July respecting the dissolution of the trade unions of active and inactive workers, except the Transport Workers' Union which, according to the Decree, has acted within the trade union context and remained on the fringe of any political activity. It has also taken note of Presidential Decree No.  of  August to provide for the appointment of workers' representatives to perform trade union functions pending the establishment of a new trade union organisation. In this connection the Committee wishes to stress that under Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Bolivia, workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority. The Committee would like to lay particular emphasis on this principle in the present case, since the measures in question affect almost all the trade union organisations in the country and accordingly have extremely serious implications for the defence of the occupational interests of Bolivian workers.
.The Committee notes that the Government has authorised the creation of groups of labour relations agents, elected by workers' Committees to represent the workers. The Committee considers however that such groups cannot be a substitute for the trade union organisations which the Bolivian workers had freely set up. It wishes to recall the importance attaching to the right of workers to join the organisations of their choice.
.As regards the arrest of the ICFTU members on a mission to Bolivia, the Committee notes that the persons concerned, following their arrest and maltreatment, have been released and expelled from the territory. The Committee nevertheless considers it necessary to ask the Government to supply information on the allegation that a sum of money carried by the members of the mission was confiscated.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that a representative of the Director-General has visited the country to examine the trade union situation on the spot, jointly with the Government;(b) to express its deep concern at the gravity of certain allegations and to recall as a general principle that a truly free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected;(c) to urge the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the death of trade union leaders and to communicate information on the precise circumstances of these deaths if it is true that these persons are no longer alive;(d) to note that certain persons mentioned by the complainants have been released but that a significant number of other persons have been either restricted to specified towns or exiled;(e) consequently, to recall to the Government the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above concerning measures of arrest, restriction to specified towns and exile, and in particular the importance of the existence of appropriate judicial safeguards and to ask the Government to supply information on the present position of the other trade unionists mentioned in the complaints;(f) to call the Government's particular attention to Article  of Convention No, , ratified by Bolivia, according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority;(g) to express the firm hope that the Bolivian trade unions will soon be returned to their previous status and that the proposed new legislation will be in full conformity with Conventions Nos.  and , and that in revising the trade union legislation the Government will, as it has indicated is its intention, seek the advice and co-operation of the ILO, and to request the Government to supply information on the progress made in the adoption of this legislation and on the evolution of the trade union situation;(h) to note that the members of the ICFTU who were arrested during a mission to Bolivia have been released and expelled but, in the absence of observations from the Government on this point, to request it to provide information on the alleged confiscation of a sum of money carried by the members of the mission;(i) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
58,".It should be borne in mind that complaints have been coming before the Committee in connection with this case since October . In the years immediately following the change of regime on  August , the Committee was called upon to examine allegations relating to the closing down by order of the Government of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), the Bolivian Miners' Trade Union Federation (FSTMB) and the La Paz Central of Workers, the takeover of the Bolivian National Urban Schoolteachers' Federation, and the arrest or banishment of trade unionists. In more recent years, the allegations were concerned more particularly with the decrees adopted in November  involving major restrictions on trade union rights in all branches of the economy as well as the trade union situation in the mining industry. Two direct contact missions were carried out in Bolivia - from  March to  April  and from  to  July  - by a representative of the Director-General.
.Furthermore, the complaint filed under article  of the Constitution of the ILO refers to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made, in particular, of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.
.A special national Committee had drafted a new Labour Code and rules of procedure designed to replace, in particular, the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights.
.In November  the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, expressed its regret that, notwithstanding the time which had elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed to by Bolivia were still not observed in the country, and had appealed to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activities in Bolivia.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, urged the Government to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the list of persons dismissed and the reopening of the miners' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers' and miners' leaders who were still imprisoned or exiled. The Committee and the Governing Body had examined the action taken on these recommendations on several occasions. In particular, at its November  Session, the Governing Body, while noting with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, had urged the Government to continue its review of the situation of the other workers' and miners' leaders who were still under arrest or in exile. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to ensure the rapid return of the miners' radio stations to the workers.
.In broader terms, the Governing Body had suggested that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile.
.In January , the Government supplied the following information:- general elections would be held in July ;- a general amnesty had been decreed on  January ; all those who were detained for political reasons had been immediately released and exiles had been allowed to return to the country;- the draft Labour Code had been discussed with workers' and employers' organisations previous to its adoption;- Decree No. , of  January  restored the right of association for trade unions as from  January ;- effective measures have been initiated in order to reinstate the dismissed miners in their work.
.Decree No. , mentioned above provided for the renewal of the executive Committees of the trade union organisations in accordance with the legislation currently in force and with their by-laws, within  days in the case of departmental federations and within  days in the case of national federations and Confederations. Matters of interpretation or procedure that might arise during this transitional period were to be resolved in each case by means of an agreement between the competent authorities and the representatives of the existing trade union federations in accordance with the legislative provisions currently in force. Provisions contrary to the Decree were repealed.
.At its February  Session, the Committee noted with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government. It had also studied the official text of the new version of the draft Labour Code, especially of the sections dealing with trade union rights. It noted with interest that certain provisions had been redrafted in such a way as to take into account the comments made earlier by the Office. However, other provisions were not fully in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.Accordingly, at its February-March  Session, the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, decided:(a) to note with satisfaction that a general amnesty had been decreed, that trade union elections were to be held very soon and that steps had been taken to reinstate the dismissed miners in their jobs;(b) to express the hope that these measures would make possible the rapid restoration of normal trade union activity in the country, including the return to Bolivia of all exiled trade unionists and the reinstatement of those who had lost their jobs;(c) to express further the hope that the miners' radio stations would very soon be returned to the workers and to their organisations;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the differences that continued to exist between the Conventions on freedom of association (ratified by Bolivia) and the provisions both of the General Labour Act and of the draft Labour Code;(e) to request the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to follow up the matter raised in the preceding subparagraph;(f) to request the Government to communicate, by  May  at the latest, information on the development of the trade union situation in the country, particularly in the mining sector.
.The Governing Body had also requested the Government to transmit information on the evolution of the trade union situation. B. Latest developments
.In its communication dated  May  the Government states that, by virtue of Decree No. , almost all the trade unions have renewed their executive Committees and that the departmental federations are at present doing likewise in a climate of absolute freedom and with all the necessary guarantees. If there has been more delay than was initially envisaged, this has been minimal and completely independent of any outside interference whatsoever in the organisations in question.
.According to information supplied by the Minister of the Interior, there is no case at present of anyone being detained for political reasons and even less so for trade union reasons. Moreover, all those exiled have been able to return to the country unhindered.
.As regards the promulgation of the new Labour Code the Government points out that, because of the trade union elections that are presently under way and the forthcoming institutionalisation of the country, it seemed preferable not to hasten the process of promulgation that was originally envisaged. This draft will be one of the first matters to be submitted to the national Parliament after the general elections which are due to take place on  July this year. Meantime, the general labour law remains in force.
.The Committee notes, with interest, the information provided by the Government. This information shows that most of the decisions taken by the Government on trade union questions at the beginning of  have been, or are being implemented in practice. In particular, it appears that the majority of trade union organisations have now new leaders elected by the membership and that elections within the organisations are now taking place. In addition, there are no cases of persons being detained for trade union reasons and leaders who were in exile have been able to return to the country.
.As regards the trade union legislation, to which special reference was made in the complaint submitted under article  of the Constitution, the Committee notes that the draft of the new Labour Code will be submitted to the national Parliament after the elections. It notes, moreover, that comments on this draft were made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at its session in May  and that the matter will be followed by that Committee within the context of the normal procedure for the examination of reports on the application of ratified Conventions.
.The Committee expresses the hope that the trade union situation will continue to develop favourably, especially in the mining sector and that the radio stations will be returned to the workers and their organisations.
.In these circumstances, and taking account of the positive changes that have taken place in the trade union situation in Bolivia since the complaints were presented as indicated in paragraph (a) and (b), the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no purpose would be served",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
59,"in pursuing further its examination of the case either under the special freedom of association procedure or under the procedure provided for under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.It should be borne in mind that complaints have been coming before the Committee in connection with this case since October . In the years immediately following the change of regime in August , the Committee was called upon to examine allegations relating to the closing down by order of the Government of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), the Bolivian Miners' Trade Union Federation (FSTMB) and the La Paz Central of Workers, the takeover of the Bolivian National Urban Schoolteachers' Federation, and the arrest or banishment of trade unionists. In more recent years, the allegations have been concerned more particularly with the decrees adopted in November  involving major restrictions on trade union rights in all branches of the economy and with the trade union situation in the mining industry. Two direct contacts missions have been carried out in Bolivia - from  March to  April  and from - July  - by a representative of the Director-General.
.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of the Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour coordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lock-outs and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour coordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a Labour Code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.
.Furthermore, the complaint filed under article  of the Constitution of the ILO referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.
.A special national Committee drafted a new Labour Code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. According to the Government, the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO's opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government stated that it had taken a number of steps pending the adoption of the new legislation. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.
.In a communication of  October , the Government referred to a speech made on  July  by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court. He stated that the Government was preparing for Bolivia's return to a Constitutional regime. Since this would have to be preceded by what might be termed an institutionalisation phase, the people would be consulted with a view to introducing into the national Constitution amendments reflecting the new realities in the country and the prospects opening up as a result. Once these reforms had been approved by the people, continued the Head of State, Constitutional government would be restored. The Government added that the adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation were comprised in the measures to be adopted as part of the process leading up to the country's return to a Constitutional regime.
.In November , the Committee had expressed its deep concern at the slowness of the progress toward the restoration of a normal trade union situation in the country; the legislation announced had still not been adopted and the restrictions on the exercise of trade union activities were still in force. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body had expressed its regret that, notwithstanding the time which had elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed by Bolivia were still not observed in the country and had appealed to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activities in Bolivia.
.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee had examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . In November , the Committee had reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body had urged the Government to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the list of persons dismissed and the re-opening of the miners' broadcasting stations and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers' and miners' leaders who were still imprisoned or exiled. The Committee and the Governing Body had examined the action taken on these recommendations on several occasions. In particular, at its November  Session the Governing Body, while noting with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, had urged the Government to continue its review of the situation of the other workers' and miners' leaders who were still under arrest or in exile. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to ensure the rapid return of the miners' radio stations to the workers.
.In broader terms, the Governing Body had suggested that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile.
.In a letter which the Committee received just before its November  Session, the COB alleged that the Government was preventing workers who had been released from prison or had returned from exile from returning to work in the mines. Their names were in fact on black-lists which were discreetly circulated among the senior officials of the government institutions and state and private enterprises so that they should not be given any work. The COB also gave the names of several trade unionists and union leaders who had been arrested: Armando Morales, an official of the Miners' Federation, Flavio Villar, a union leader in the manufacturing industry, and Mario Carrasco, Arns, Quispe, Tola and Alarcn, trade unionists.
.The representative of the Bolivian Government had made various statements regarding the development of the trade union situation to the November  Session of the Governing Body. In a communication dated  January , the Government clarified and amplified these statements with the following information:- general elections are to be held in July ;- a general amnesty was decreed on  January ; all persons under arrest for political reasons were released immediately and those in exile have been allowed to return to the country;- consultations were held on the draft Labour Code with the employers' and workers' organisations, a procedure necessary for its adoption;- Decree No. , of  January  restores the right of association as from  January ;- effective steps have been taken to ensure that the dismissed miners are reinstated in their jobs.
.Decree No. , mentioned above provides for the renewal of the executive Committees of the trade union organisations in accordance with the legislation currently in force and with their by-laws, within  days for first-degree unions,  days in the case of departmental federations and within  days in the case of national federations and Confederations. Matters of interpretation or procedure that may arise during this transitional period are to be resolved in each case by means of an agreement between the competent authorities and the representative of the existing trade union federation in accordance with the legislative provisions currently in",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
60,"force. Provisions contrary to the decree are repealed.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated by the Government. It expresses the hope that the general amnesty and, in particular, the holding of trade union elections will permit the rapid restoration of trade union activities in the country. It also hopes that these measures will make it possible for all exiled trade unionists and union officials to return to the country and for all those who have lost their jobs, specifically in the mining sector, to be reinstated. Finally, the Committee trusts that the miners' radio stations will very soon be restored to the workers and to their organisations.
.The Committee has also taken note of the official text of a new version of the draft Labour Code, especially of the sections dealing with trade union rights. It has noted with interest that certain provisions have been redrafted in such a way as to take into account the comments made earlier by the Office. However, other provisions are not fully in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to examine this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with satisfaction that a general amnesty has been decreed, that trade union elections are to be held very soon and that steps have been taken to reinstate the dismissed miners in their jobs;(b) to express the hope that these measures will make possible the rapid restoration of normal trade union activity in the country, including the return to Bolivia of all exiled trade unionists and the reinstatement of those who had lost their jobs;(c) to express further the hope that the miners' radio stations will very soon be returned to the workers and to their organisations;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the differences that continue to exist between the Conventions on freedom of association (ratified by Bolivia) and the provisions both of the General Labour Act and of the draft Labour Code;(e) to request the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to follow up the matter raised in the preceding subparagraph;(f) to request the Government to communicate, by  May at the latest, information on the development of the trade union situation in the country, particularly in the mining sector;(g) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined allegations relating to the years immediately following the change of regime on  August  (closing down of the COB, the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers and the FSTMB; takeover of the National Urban Schoolteachers' Federation; arrest and banishment of trade unionists). It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.
.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.
.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO's opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers' and workers' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers' and workers' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.
.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.
.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.
.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts,",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
61,"but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.
.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.
.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body stressed that the miners' broadcasting stations should be rapidly returned to the workers and their organisations.
.The Committee and the Governing Body also noted the new measures as a result of which some trade unionists - arrested or exiled as a result of the events in the mining industry - had been released or had been able to return to the country. They requested the Government to continue its re-examination of the situation of the other workers and trade union leaders still under arrest or exiled.
.In a more recent complaint dated  June  (with which the WFTU associated itself), the Miners' Trade Unions International referred to the detention of Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, who was said to be undergoing torture, as a result of which his health had seriously deteriorated. He was allegedly incarcerated in the prison belonging to the Department of Public Order (DOP) in La Paz. The complainants demanded that he be released, along with the many other mining trade unionists who were in prison, and that a stop be put to the repression directed against the miners who had been calling for better living and working conditions.The latest observations from the Government
.The Government stated in its letter of  August  that Mario Cortez had been released in May ; it added that while he was in custody he was in good health, and that the Government had no knowledge of any subsequent illness. His detention had nothing to do with trade union matters, but was due to the political work of subversive agitation in which Mario Cortez had been engaged in the mines.
.In its telegram of  October , the Government supplied a further list of mineworkers who had been arrested on political grounds, according to the Government, and had now been released:Roberto Acho Huarita; Juan Alfaro Moreira; Jaime Bernal Alvarado; Alberto Camacho Pardo; Gregorio Colque Capacalle; Mario Cortez Cabrere (see preceding paragraph); Simn Chumacero Facio; Freddy Ferrufino Guzmn; Isaac Gonzlez Cabezas; Manuel Hernndez Veizaga; Armando Iporre Zegarra; Hugo Marne Terrazas; Severo Mendoza Chino; Adolfo Morales Gmez; Victor Orellana Hinojosa; Paulino Palma Lpez (since rearrested, however); Serafn Ramos Quiroz; Gonzal Rivas Mercado; Fabian Romero Gmez; Delfn Saldano Hidaldo; Teodoro Sarmiento Choque; Hugo Serrano Sanjinez; Efran Velasco Gutirrez; Milan Velasquez Jauregui; Germn Zambrana Serrudo; Wilfredo Zambrana Serrudo.The Government also mentioned the names of five trade union leaders or workers in the mining sector who had been able to return from exile. The Committee notes that this latter information has already been transmitted in earlier communications.
.In more general terms, the Government referred, in its communication of  October , to a speech made on  July  by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court. He stated that the Government was preparing for Bolivia's return to a Constitutional regime, which would enable the country to accede, through the free expression of the will of the people, to a qualitatively more advanced level. Before returning to a Constitutional regime in the strict sense of the term, during  and  the country would have to go through what might be termed the institutionalisation phase: the people would be consulted with a view to introducing into the national Constitution amendments reflecting the new realities in the country and the prospects opening up as a result. Once these reforms had been approved by the people, continued the Head of State, Constitutional government would be restored in ; nothing could alter that decision. The Government added that the adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation were comprised in the measures to be adopted very shortly as part of the process leading up to the country's return to a Constitutional regime.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, notwithstanding the time which has elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed by Bolivia are still not observed in Bolivia, and to appeal to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activity in Bolivia;(b) to note with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, including Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, but to urge the Government to continue its review of the situation as concerns the other workers and trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  as being still under arrest or in exile;(c) in broader terms, to suggest that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile;(d) to request the Government once again to ensure the rapid return of the miners' radio stations to the workers;(e) to request the Government to communicate, by  February  at the latest, information on any developments in connection with the matters raised in the preceding clauses, and to take note in the meantime of this interim report.Geneva,  November .

.The Committee already examined Case No.  in February , November  and February .It submitted to the Governing Body two interim reports and a final report which are set out in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report.
.In its nd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of a number of trade unionists who had been arrested. Despite repeated measures, this information had not been received. The Committee, therefore, addressed requests to the Government in May , November , February  and May  that it provide the information requested. This matter is also covered partly by the complaint regarding failure by Bolivia to respect the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), presented under article  of the ILO Constitution by certain delegates at the th Session () of the International Labour Conference, regarding which the officers of the Governing Body submitted a report to the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). The Government finally submitted information in a letter of  September , which also refers to the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.Regarding Cases Nos. ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: two, dated  February  and  July , from the Latin American Central of Workers; three, dated  February , ",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

.The complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, for its observations. Despite the time which had elapsed since the submission of the first complaints and despite the seriousness of the allegations, the Government submitted in its communications of  June and  October  only very partial information on one of the many allegations made by the complainants. Consequently, the Committee sent an urgent request to the Government in May  to provide the information requested (Cases Nos.  and ). The Government provided this information in communications of  May and  June  (whose text was identical),  June and  and  September .

.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, notwithstanding the time which has elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed by Bolivia are still not observed in Bolivia, and to appeal to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activity in Bolivia;(b) to note with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, including Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, but to urge the Government to continue its review of the situation as concerns the other workers and trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  as being still under arrest or in exile;(c) in broader terms, to suggest that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile;(d) to request the Government once again to ensure the rapid return of the miners' radio stations to the workers;(e) to request the Government to communicate, by  February  at the latest, information on any developments in connection with the matters raised in the preceding clauses, and to take note in the meantime of this interim report.Geneva,  November .

.The Committee already examined Case No.  in February , November  and February .It submitted to the Governing Body two interim reports and a final report which are set out in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report.
.In its nd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of a number of trade unionists who had been arrested. Despite repeated measures, this information had not been received. The Committee, therefore, addressed requests to the Government in May , November , February  and May  that it provide the information requested. This matter is also covered partly by the complaint regarding failure by Bolivia to respect the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), presented under article  of the ILO Constitution by certain delegates at the th Session () of the International Labour Conference, regarding which the officers of the Governing Body submitted a report to the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). The Government finally submitted information in a letter of  September , which also refers to the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.Regarding Cases Nos. ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: two, dated  February  and  July , from the Latin American Central of Workers; three, dated  February ,  June and  July , from the International Federation of Teachers' Unions; two, dated  November  and  March , from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions; two, dated  November  and  July , from the world Federation of Trade Unions; four, dated  November and  December  and  February and  August , from the World Confederation of Labour; one, dated  November , from the Inter-American Regional Organisation of workers; and a communication of  January  sent jointly by the Bolivian Central of Workers and the Bolivian Miners' Trade Union Federation.
.The complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, for its observations. Despite the time which had elapsed since the submission of the first complaints and despite the seriousness of the allegations, the Government submitted in its communications of  June and  October  only very partial information on one of the many allegations made by the complainants. Consequently, the Committee sent an urgent request to the Government in May  to provide the information requested (Cases Nos.  and ). The Government provided this information in communications of  May and  June  (whose text was identical),  June and  and  September .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
65,".The Committee has already examined allegations relating to the years immediately following the change of regime on  August  (closing down of the COB, the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers and the FSTMB; takeover of the National Urban Schoolteachers' Federation; arrest and banishment of trade unionists). It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.
.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.
.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO's opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers' and workers' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers' and workers' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.
.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.
.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.
.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.
.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.
.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June  session,",-1,2012,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
66,"the Governing Body stressed that the miners' broadcasting stations should be rapidly returned to the workers and their organisations.
.The Committee and the Governing Body also noted the new measures as a result of which some trade unionists - arrested or exiled as a result of the events in the mining industry - had been released or had been able to return to the country. They requested the Government to continue its re-examination of the situation of the other workers and trade union leaders still under arrest or exiled.
.In a more recent complaint dated  June  (with which the WFTU associated itself), the Miners' Trade Unions International referred to the detention of Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, who was said to be undergoing torture, as a result of which his health had seriously deteriorated. He was allegedly incarcerated in the prison belonging to the Department of Public Order (DOP) in La Paz. The complainants demanded that he be released, along with the many other mining trade unionists who were in prison, and that a stop be put to the repression directed against the miners who had been calling for better living and working conditions.The latest observations from the Government
.The Government stated in its letter of  August  that Mario Cortez had been released in May ; it added that while he was in custody he was in good health, and that the Government had no knowledge of any subsequent illness. His detention had nothing to do with trade union matters, but was due to the political work of subversive agitation in which Mario Cortez had been engaged in the mines.
.In its telegram of  October , the Government supplied a further list of mineworkers who had been arrested on political grounds, according to the Government, and had now been released:Roberto Acho Huarita; Juan Alfaro Moreira; Jaime Bernal Alvarado; Alberto Camacho Pardo; Gregorio Colque Capacalle; Mario Cortez Cabrere (see preceding paragraph); Simn Chumacero Facio; Freddy Ferrufino Guzmn; Isaac Gonzlez Cabezas; Manuel Hernndez Veizaga; Armando Iporre Zegarra; Hugo Marne Terrazas; Severo Mendoza Chino; Adolfo Morales Gmez; Victor Orellana Hinojosa; Paulino Palma Lpez (since rearrested, however); Serafn Ramos Quiroz; Gonzal Rivas Mercado; Fabian Romero Gmez; Delfn Saldano Hidaldo; Teodoro Sarmiento Choque; Hugo Serrano Sanjinez; Efran Velasco Gutirrez; Milan Velasquez Jauregui; Germn Zambrana Serrudo; Wilfredo Zambrana Serrudo.The Government also mentioned the names of five trade union leaders or workers in the mining sector who had been able to return from exile. The Committee notes that this latter information has already been transmitted in earlier communications.
.In more general terms, the Government referred, in its communication of  October , to a speech made on  July  by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court. He stated that the Government was preparing for Bolivia's return to a Constitutional regime, which would enable the country to accede, through the free expression of the will of the people, to a qualitatively more advanced level. Before returning to a Constitutional regime in the strict sense of the term, during  and  the country would have to go through what might be termed the institutionalisation phase: the people would be consulted with a view to introducing into the national Constitution amendments reflecting the new realities in the country and the prospects opening up as a result. Once these reforms had been approved by the people, continued the Head of State, Constitutional government would be restored in ; nothing could alter that decision. The Government added that the adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation were comprised in the measures to be adopted very shortly as part of the process leading up to the country's return to a Constitutional regime.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, notwithstanding the time which has elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed by Bolivia are still not observed in Bolivia, and to appeal to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activity in Bolivia;(b) to note with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, including Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, but to urge the Government to continue its review of the situation as concerns the other workers and trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  as being still under arrest or in exile;(c) in broader terms, to suggest that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile;(d) to request the Government once again to ensure the rapid return of the miners' radio stations to the workers;(e) to request the Government to communicate, by  February  at the latest, information on any developments in connection with the matters raised in the preceding clauses, and to take note in the meantime of this interim report.Geneva,  November .

The complainants point out that a few days previously, three representatives of the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia who had been invited by the complainants to attend a seminar for the River Plate Basin in Buenos Aires were arrested at La Paz airport by police and armed forces. The complainants add that there is a continually growing list of trade union leaders and members held in concentration camps in the interior of the country and that many are tortured, murdered, abducted without trace, or exiled.
.In the further communication dated  December  the complainants state that at the Sixth Latin American Congress of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, held in Caracas from  to  November , lists were drawn up of trade union leaders deprived of their liberty in Bolivia. According to the complainants these lists are based on reliable information collected from within the country. Copies of the said lists are supplied by the complainants. These lists contain the names of the following  trade union leaders, who are stated to have been deprived of their liberty: Juvenal Garabito (Cochabamba), Carmelo Andrade (""Presencia"" newspaper), Jacinto Quispe (General Secretary, ASIB), Roberto Moreira (court employee), Erasmo Barrios Villa (Potosi University Workers), Luis Pearanda (executive, Press Federation), Rodolfo Brum (Nueva Amrica Radio), Victor Michel (delegate, Huanuni Assembly), Angel Astete (Secretary, Miners' Cultural Association, San Florencio), Julin Jimnez (Colquiri Miners' Association), Juan Flores (Relations Secretary, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Patricio Cuentos (Secretary, Disputes Section, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Pedro Cruz (Disputes Secretary, State Teachers' Union, Huanuni Mine, Oruro), and Lindo Fernndez, David Quinez and Ren Higueras (Bolivian Workers' Confederation-COB). In addition, the complainants supply a list of women whom they allege to have been imprisoned. This list includes the names of Edmy Alvarez Daza, a leader of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, and Enma de Bacarreza, leader of the La Paz Teachers' Union. The complainants state that the house of the latter was searched and that she was taken to the Ministry of the Interior to make statements. This, continued the complainants, lasted several days, during which time her house was under police surveillance.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that, following the coup d'tat of October , the Government of General Torres Gonzlez was forced by extreme left-wing parties to follow a policy which bred fear and insecurity in all sectors of the country. A number of extremist agitators made their way into the Bolivian workers' movement, which had achieved much in the past.
.The Government claims that all workers' organisations enjoy every guarantee towards their development but that some leaders had compromised themselves politically with the government which was deposed in August , by substituting political activities for trade union activities. These few trade union leaders, on  August in Santa Cruz, and on  August in La Paz, distributed arms to workers and students whom they had incited against their own brothers.
.The Government also states that the free functioning of the following organisations is proof that freedom of association is observed: the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia, with  member unions; the Trade Union Federation of Railway Workers, with  member unions; the Confederation of Bank Employees and Allied workers, with  member unions; the Trade Union Federation of Drivers of Bolivia, with  member unions; the Trade Union Federation of Construction Workers, with  member unions; the Trade Union Confederation of Municipal workers, with  member unions; and the National Federation of Mineworkers with  member unions. Altogether, the Government states,  Confederations,  federations,  trade unions and other organisations are functioning normally.
.The Government adds that the small number of former trade union leaders who were arrested when it was proved that they had been involved in activities against the security of the State have been released, and that others will be tried before the ordinary courts s
.It also states that the aim of the labour policy of the Government is the independence of the Bolivian workers' movement and that there is no justification for any state intervention in the internal affairs of trade unions provided that they are not misled by anarchists.
.In its communication of  May  the Government emphasises that it respects and guarantees the independence of workers' organisations and the free exercise of trade union rights and that seven Confederations and forty federations are operating normally and that no strikes have taken place for seven months. The Government supplies a list of organisations which have re-elected their officers since  August .
.The Governing Body drew the attention of the Government to the rule which it had followed in a number of cases', namely that where allegations are made that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amount to general denials of the allegations or are simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security, or for crimes under ordinary law, the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order that a proper examination may be made of the allegations. Accordingly, the Government has been repeatedly requested to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders in question, as well as the text of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor. This information has not been received.
.At its session in May , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to supply this information. This appeal having proved fruitless, the Committee, at its session in November , and by virtue of the procedure set forth in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at the Committee's present session, even if the information requested from the Government had still not been received. So far the information requested has not been received.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observations made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to recall that in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official, the Committee and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was incumbent upon the government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned;(c) to recall that in cases of this kind, the Committee and the Governing Body have reached the conclusion that allegations relating to the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination only after considering observations from the governments showing with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by the exercise of trade union freedoms but by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature;(d) to draw attention to the principle that it should be the policy of every government to ensure observance of the rights of man and, especially, of the right of all detained or accused persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment;(e) to deplore the fact that despite the repeated requests the Government has not submitted the information sought, thereby making it impossible for the Committee to formulate its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts;(f) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraphs  and  above who were arrested.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its session in February-March , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which is contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report.
.At its session in June  the Committee, having noted that the Government had not yet supplied the information or observations which it had been requested to supply, adjourned its examination of the case.
.In a communication dated  May , addressed direct to the ILO, the Government transmitted certain observations in connection with the trade union situation in Bolivia.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the",-1,1971,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
70,"complaint concerned mainly the arrest at La Paz airport of three representatives of the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia in October , and the detention, in particular, of the following trade union leaders: Juvenal Garabito (Cochabamba), Carmelo Andrade (Presencia newspaper), Jacinto Quispe (General Secretary, ASIB), Roberto Moreira (court employee), Erasmo Barrios Villa (Potosi University Workers), Luis Pearanda (executive, Press Federation), Rodolfo Brum (Nueva Amrica Radio), Victor Michel (delegate, Huanuni Assembly), Angel Astete (Secretary, Miners' Cultural Association, San Florencio), Julin Jimnez (Colquiri Miners' Association), Juan Flores (Secretary, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Patricio Cuentos (Secretary, Disputes Section, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Pedro Cruz (Disputes Secretary, State Teachers' Union, Huanuni mine, Oruro), and Lindo Fernndez, David Quinez and Ren Higueras (Bolivian Workers' Confederation-COB). In addition, the complainants supplied a list of women whom they alleged to have been imprisoned. This list included the names of Edmy Alvarez Daza, a leader of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, and Enma de Bacarreza, leader of the La Paz Teachers' Union. The complainants stated that the house of the latter had been searched and that she had been taken to the Ministry of the Interior to make statements. This, continued the complainants, had lasted several days, during which her house was watched by the police.
.In this connection, since no specific replies to these allegations had been supplied by the Government, a fact that prevented the Committee from expressing a considered view to the Governing Body with regard to the complaint, the Committee emphasised, as it has often done in the past in similar cases, that when detailed factual charges are put forward governments should formulate detailed factual replies for objective examination by the Committee. The Committee, at the same time, drew the attention of the Government to the rule which it has followed in a number of cases, namely that, where allegations are made that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amount to general denials of the allegations or are simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security, or for crimes under ordinary law, the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to enable the Committee to make a proper examination of the allegations.
.Accordingly, the Committee requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders in question, as well as the text of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that it respects and guarantees the independence of workers' organisations and the free exercise of trade union rights. The Government adds that seven Confederations and forty federations are operating normally and that no strikes have taken place for seven months. The Government supplies a list of organisations which have re-elected their officers since  August .
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government. It regrets, however, that despite the urgent nature of the matters involved, the Government has again failed to communicate any information concerning the specific allegations formulated by the complainants. In this connection the Committee would draw the attention of the Government to the observation which it made as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.The Committee would recall that in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official, the Committee and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was incumbent upon the government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. The Committee would also recall that in cases of this kind, when the Committee and the Governing Body have reached the conclusion that allegations relating to the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further consideration, this was only after considering observations from the governments concerned indicating the specific measures taken against such persons and showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by the exercise of trade union freedoms but by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with regret that, in spite of the urgent nature of the matter, the Government has supplied no specific observations on the allegations made by the complainants, with the result that the Committee is unable to reach its conclusions on the case;(b) to recall that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations and principles set out in paragraphs  and  above;(d) to request the Government once again to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  above, as well as the texts of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor; and(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested in accordance with subparagraph (d) of this paragraph.Geneva,  November .

.The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  October , addressed direct to the ILO. In a further communication, dated  December , the complainants submitted additional information in support of the complaint.
.The complaint and additional information were transmitted to the Government, which communicated its observations thereon in a letter dated  January .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions states that the Government continues to violate the most elementary rights of workers in Bolivia. The complainants point out that a few days previously three representatives of the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia, who had been invited by the complainants to attend a seminar for the River Plate Basin in Buenos Aires, were arrested at La Paz airport by police and army forces.
.The complainants add that there is a continually growing list of trade union leaders and members held in veritable concentration camps in the interior of the country and that many are tortured, murdered, abducted without trace, or exiled.
.In the further communication dated  December , the complainants state that at the Sixth Latin American Congress of CLASC, held in Caracas from  to  November , lists were drawn up of those trade union leaders who had been deprived of their liberty in Bolivia. According to the complainants, these lists are based on reliable information collected from within the country. Copies of the said lists are supplied by the complainants.
.The above lists contain the names of the following  trade union leaders who are stated to have been deprived of their liberty: Juvenal Garabito (Cochabamba), Carmelo Andrade ("" Presencia "" newspaper), Jacinto Quispe (General Secretary, ASIB), Roberto Moreira (court employee), Erasmo Barrios Villa (Potosi University Workers), Luis Pearanda (Executive, Press Federation), Rodolfo Brum (Nueva Amrica Radio), Victor Michel (Delegate, Huanuni Assembly), Angel Astete (Secretary, Miners' Cultural Association, San Florencio), Julin Jimnez (Colquiri Miners' Associations), Juan Flores (Secretary, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Patricio Cuentos (Secretary, Disputes Section, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Pedro Cruz (Disputes Secretary, State Teachers' Union, Mina de Huanuni, Oruro), and Lindo Fernndez, David Quionez and Ren Higueras (Bolivian Workers' Confederation-COB). In addition, the complainants supply a list of women who they allege have been imprisoned. This list includes the names of Edmy Alvarez Daza, a leader of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, and Emma de Bacarreza, leader of the La Paz Teachers' Union. The complainants state that the house of the latter was searched and that she was taken to the Ministry of the Interior to make statements. This, continued the complainants, lasted several",-1,1971,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
71,"days, during which her house was watched by the police.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that following the coup d'tat of October , the Government of Torres Gonzlez, which lacked popular support, was forced by extreme left-wing parties to follow a policy which bred fear and insecurity in all sectors of the country. A number of extremist agitators made their way into the Bolivian workers' movement, which had achieved much in the past.

Altogether, states the Government,  Confederations,  federations,  trade unions and other organisations are functioning normally.
.The Government adds that the small number of former trade union leaders who were arrested when it was proved that they had been involved in activities against the security of the State have been released, and that others will be tried before the ordinary courts.
.The aim of the labour policy of the Government is the independence of the Bolivian workers' movement. There is no justification, states the Government, for any state intervention in the internal affairs of trade unions, provided they are not misled by anarchists.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns mainly the arrest at La Paz airport of three representatives of the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia in October , and the detention of a number of trade union leaders, whose names are supplied by the complainants. The Government, in reply to the complaint, makes no reference to the specific allegations made in this respect by the complainants, but confines itself to stating that a number of trade union leaders had compromised themselves with the previous Government, that a small number of leaders who were arrested have been released and that others will be tried by the ordinary courts.
.The Committee has often emphasised that, when detailed factual charges are put forward, governments should formulate detailed factual replies for objective examination by the Committee. In the present case, while the Committee has noted the information supplied by the Government concerning the number of trade union organisations which appear to be functioning normally in Bolivia, the Committee considers that it is unable to express a considered view to the Governing Body with regard to the complaint since the Government has supplied no specific information in reply to the allegations concerning the arrest and detention of the persons referred to or named in paragraphs  and  above. In a number of cases where there were allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegations or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security, or for common law crimes, the Committee followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the information supplied by the Government with regard to the trade union situation in Bolivia;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in paragraph  above and to request the Government to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders referred to in paragraphs  and  above, as well as the text of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor; and(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report when it has received the information requested in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1971,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
72,".The Committee previously examined this case at its sessions in November  and May , on each of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paragraphs -, and th Report, paragraphs -.)
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding in the present case, as contained in the complaint submitted on  October  by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights, refer in part to specific measures said to have affected the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, the Bolivian Federation of Mineworkers' Unions and other bodies. Furthermore, it was specifically claimed that the trade union legislation promulgated on  September  (replacing the Decrees issued in ) contained various clauses which ran counter to the principles of freedom of association.
.The Government supplied further observations regarding the complaint in two communications dated  June and  August , addressed to the Director-General of the ILO.
.In its communication of  June  the Government then in power stated that, on  October , a nationalist revolutionary government had assumed power in Bolivia and that, while under the previous Government the activities of the trade union movement were restricted, and trade union leaders persecuted, since  October  there had been a sharp change in the fortune of labour organisations. The Government stated that the Bolivian Federation of Labour had been able to play a prominent part on the political scene and to reach agreement at its Fourth National Congress (in May ) on a policy setting forth the responsibilities to be borne by the Bolivian working class in the life of the nation. There was, added the Government, real respect for trade union rights and freedoms. Miners had been granted a  per cent wage increase, the unions were free to publish their bulletins, and cordial relations existed between the labour movement and the revolutionary government. There existed, the Government continued, neither political repression nor harassment of organised labour, which enjoyed every freedom.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the trade union legislation enacted on  September  (Presidential Decree No. ), which replaced the legislation on trade unions issued in , the Committee notes from information supplied by the Government in another case relating to Bolivia (letter dated  December )-and confirmed in the communication dated  August -that this Presidential Decree has been repealed by Presidential Decree No.  of  September , under which provisions guaranteeing freedom of association and the free and democratic election of trade union leaders are to be drawn up, with the participation of workers' organisations established at the national level.
.The Committee observes, in connection with the legislation affecting workers' organisations in Bolivia, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in its observations addressed to the Government in March , requested the Government to provide information, in its next report under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, concerning the action taken under Presidential Decree No.  of  September  and the legislation in force regarding trade unions.
.In the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement of the Government which had taken over on  October , concerning the changes which had taken place in the trade union situation while that Government was in power;(b) to note that Presidential Decree No.  of  September  was repealed and replaced by Presidential Decree No.  of  September  and that the question of the legislation in force regarding trade unions is being pursued by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations; and(c) to decide that the outstanding allegations, and therefore the case as a whole, do not call for further examination by the Committee.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body which appeared in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The complaints are contained in a communication sent to the ILO by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights on  October  and in a communication sent to the ILO on  February  by the Confederation of American Teachers.
.When the Committee examined the case in November  it had received the preliminary observations of the Government in respect of the first of the two complaints, but not in respect of the second. In these circumstances the Committee had recommended in paragraph  of its th Report that the Government forward its detailed comments on the substance of both the complaints.
.By a communication dated  March  the Government forwarded its observations on the complaint submitted by the Confederation of American Teachers. To date, however, the Government has not forwarded the detailed comments requested by the Committee in its th Report on the complaint submitted by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint dated  February  the Confederation of American Teachers says that: "" the deplorable financial circumstances of Bolivian teachers are at the root of the protest movement in which the majority of the country's teachers have taken part."" Instead of meeting the teachers' legitimate demands for salary increases and improving their conditions of work, the Government, it is alleged, has ordered the dismissal of , teachers. It is further alleged that a Supreme Council for Education was set up, which reports directly to the President and "" with which the teachers are obliged to re-register without their union being able to intervene in any way."" According to the complaint, this was a requirement imposed upon the dismissed teachers if they wished to have a chance to work the following year.
.It is alleged that the Government of Bolivia took a series of repressive measures against the leaders of the teachers' unions. The complainants state that the General Secretary of the National Federation of Urban Schoolmasters, Mr. R. Dvila Morales, and the Press Secretary of this Federation, Mr. A. Quiroz Elguera, were expelled from the country.
.The Confederation of American Teachers, which has stated that it has affiliated organisations in Bolivia (the National Educational Workers' Confederation and the Departmental Schoolteachers' Federation of La Paz), considers that the Government has infringed the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and . It hopes that ILO intervention will induce the authorities to quash the order for the dismissal of , teachers, to restore the right to bargain collectively and to put an end to "" the persecution of leaders of teachers' unions officially recognised by the administrative authorities of Bolivia.""
.In its communication of  March  the Government draws attention to Bolivia's present economic situation, which, it claims, made it impossible for it to accede to the teachers' demands for higher wages without causing hardship to other classes of workers and damaging the economy as a whole.
.The Government points out, moreover, that, despite the fact that the teachers had disrupted the educational process by encouraging their pupils to stage solidarity strikes and practise prolonged absenteeism, it had displayed boundless patience in a situation of considerable gravity. However, when, as a result of a mass demonstration in support of the Government's refusal to accede to the teachers' demands, the people expressed their desire for the dismissal of all the teachers, it was decreed that the school year should end forthwith and the teachers be dismissed.
.The Government further states that during the school holidays the recently created National Council for Education was able to carry out the arduous task of rationalisation by means of a code of standards and decisions which settled the education problem to the satisfaction of the majority of urban and rural schoolteachers, the heads of families and the population in general.
.The Government concludes its observations by denying the allegations relating to the deportation and persecution of teachers. According to the Government certain teachers had chosen voluntary exile whereas others had considered themselves persecuted by the security services either when they found that their political resistance to the Government and the decrees issued by the National Council for Education had been a complete failure, or possibly when each of them realised the extent of his own share in the blame.
.In the light of the above information it would appear that, having put forward a certain number of claims which were not met by the Government, the teachers encouraged the pupils to stage solidarity strikes in their support. It was then that the Government decided to dismiss the teachers and to take certain measures to resolve",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
73,"the education problem. As a result of these measures the teachers were obliged to re-register with the authorities if they wished to be reinstated and it seems that most of them were, in fact, re-employed for the following school year. According to the Government, no teachers have been persecuted or deported.
.The Committee notes the complainant's request that the right to engage in collective bargaining be restored to the teachers. In the light of the principles contained in Convention No. , the Committee would like to draw attention to the desirability of promoting voluntary collective bargaining, according to national conditions, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment. If the parties cannot come to any agreement during this procedure and if the right to strike is denied to certain categories of workers (as it is in Bolivia to public servants), the Committee has always considered that adequate guarantees should be afforded to the workers concerned in order fully to safeguard their interests, such as adequate, impartial and rapid conciliation and arbitration proceedings in which those concerned may participate at all stages. The Committee is of the opinion that had these procedures been followed in the present case the consequences of the dispute arising out of the teachers' claims might have been avoided or, at least, considerably attenuated.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:
.The complaints are contained in a communication sent to the ILO by the Bolivian National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights on  October , and in a communication sent to the ILO on  February  by the Confederation of American Teachers. The texts of these complaints were referred to the Government of Bolivia, which in a communication dated  January , sent in certain preliminary observations on the first of the two complaints.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights states in its communication of  October  that it was set up "" as a result of the dissolution of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation by administrative authority, through the decree issued by the Governing Military Junta on  May  "". It states that as far as trade union matters are concerned, certain decisions taken by the Junta (which remained in power until August ) are still in force. Presidential decrees, promulgated in May and June , had ordered the reorganisation of trade unions, cancelled the mandate of all persons holding office in any trade union, federation, Confederation, or central workers' organisation and provided that for trade union elections to be valid they must be presided over by a representative of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and by the civil or military authority of the district. Once the provisions of these decrees had been met, the trade union executive committees which were thus elected were to be recognised by separate Ministerial Orders. Candidates for election to trade union office were required to submit their candidature together with a statement of their qualifications to the Ministry ten days before the date of the election. By these measures, the complainants declare, the Government disregarded the existence of the trade union organisations, interfered in their internal matters and selected candidates for trade union office. It is alleged that this interference placed the workers' organisations under the Government's supervision and absolute control.
.The complaint states that on the basis of such provisions the Government, by decrees issued in May and June , and by a decree issued on  September , took the following specific measures: withdrawal of recognition from the Bolivian Workers' Confederation as well as from the branch Confederations, federations and trade unions; withdrawal of recognition from the Federation of Bolivian Mineworkers' Unions; confiscation of all trade union property; reduction of wages for the miners employed by the Mining Corporation of Bolivia; imprisonment, banishment and persecution of trade union leaders, "" many of whom "", like certain miners employed by the Bolivian Mining Corporation, "" do not know, even today, the reason for their imprisonment ""; measures of violence against the working population of Sora Sora, Siglo XX, Huanuni, Animas-Chocaya and Quechisla, culminating in the massacre which took place on  June , in Catavi; and the mass dismissal of , teachers.
.The complainants go on to say that on  September  new trade union regulations were issued by decree, which at present govern the whole of trade union life in Bolivia and violate not only ILO Conventions but also the law of the land, including Constitutional provisions. In accordance with the decree, they add, the Ministry of Labour "" shall exercise over-all guidance over the trade union organisations without prejudice to freedom of action ""; the legal personality of every trade union organisation shall be obtained by means of an order signed by the President of the Republic; elected officers must be "" recognised by name by the Government by means of a special Ministerial Order "". The decree limits the authority of trade unions to spend their own funds to the amount of , Bolivian pesos (the equivalent of $). Trade union officials must be Bolivian by birth, have worked at least six months in the undertaking, and cannot be on the committee of any political party. The complainants further criticise the system provided in the decree for the composition of trade union executive committees.
.The complainants take the view that such provisions infringe Articles , , , ,  and  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), since they prevent the Constitution of trade union organisations except with the prior authorisation, control and supervision of the Ministry; and since the authorities are empowered to recognise trade union officers and interfere in the drawing up of the Constitutions and rules and in the establishment of federations, Confederations and central workers' organisations, by restricting their number or directly depriving them of recognition. Furthermore, job security is not guaranteed to workers whose term of trade union office has expired, who are often subjected to slanderous accusations of crime, persecuted and banished.
.Finally, the complainants maintain that the stated conditions considerably affect trade union life in the country, since the Government, in addition to interfering in trade union organisation, has seized the miners' radio transmitters and the premises of the unions, and frozen union funds in bank accounts. They urge that the ILO send a committee to investigate their complaints.
.The complaint summarised above is signed by the President and Secretary of the National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights, and also by "" officers of the national trade union organisations affiliated to this Committee "", namely the Federation of Oil Industry Workers, the Bolivian Printers' Federation, the Radio Workers' Union, the National Federation of Urban Schoolteachers, the National Confederation of Rural Schoolteachers, the La Paz Building Workers' Federation, and other bodies.
.In its complaint dated  February , the Confederation of American Teachers says that: "" the deplorable financial circumstances of Bolivian teachers are at the root of the protest movement in which the majority of the country's teachers have taken part "". Instead of meeting the teachers' legitimate demands for salary increases and improving their conditions of work, the Government, it is alleged, has ordered the dismissal of , teachers. It is further alleged that a "" Supreme Council for Education "" has been set up, which reports direct to the President and "" with which the teachers are obliged to re-register without their union being able to intervene in any way "". According to the complaint, this is a requirement imposed upon the dismissed teachers if they wish to have a chance to work the following year.
.It is alleged that the Government of Bolivia has taken a series of repressive measures against the leaders of the teachers' unions. The complainants state that the General Secretary of the National Federation of Urban Schoolmasters, Mr. R. Dvila Morales, and the Press Secretary of this Federation, Mr. A. Quiroz Elguera, have been expelled from the country.
.The Confederation of American Teachers, which has stated that it has affiliated organisations in Bolivia (the National Educational Workers' Confederation and the Departmental Schoolteachers' Federation of La Paz), considers that the Government has infringed the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and . It hopes that ILO intervention will induce the authorities to quash the order for the dismissal of , teachers, to restore the right to bargain collectively and to put an end to "" the persecution of leaders of teachers' unions officially recognised by the administrative authorities of Bolivia "".
.So far, the Government has supplied only certain observations relating to the complaint lodged by the National Trade Union Committee for the Defence of Workers' Rights. In its communication dated  January  it asserts that the said Committee is",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
74,"not a legally constituted trade union body and operates outside the laws of the country. Before these complaints can be investigated, therefore, in the Government's opinion, the complainants should provide the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association with convincing proof both of its lawful Constitution and legal personality "" which may entitle it to speak on behalf of the workers of the country "". The Government says that it is prepared to reply at greater length, if and when this point is cleared up.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government to be good enough to send in its detailed comments on the substance of the complaints made in this case (as summarised in paragraphs  to  above), and to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once the observations referred to above have been received.",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
75,".The Committee has already submitted four interim reports on this case contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its st Report.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has not, on the other hand, ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.There are already three interim reports by the Committee on this matter (th Report, paragraphs  to ; th Report, paragraphs  to ; and th Report, paragraphs  to ).
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee last considered this matter at its session in May , two series of allegations remained outstanding, namely those relating to the arrest of Mr. Barrisueta, a leader of Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), and those concerning elections in the Siglo XX mines.
.Despite repeated requests by the Committee and Governing Body, the Government has not provided the information requested of it in connection with these allegations (which concern events that took place in ). Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee urgently requested the Government to supply this information (th Report, paragraph ). No reply having been received to this request, the Committee, at its session in February , in accordance with the rule of procedure set forth in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the case at the present session, even if the information asked for had not been received. To date, this information has still not been received.
.In the circumstances, the Committee considers that, before examining the allegations made, it would be appropriate to recall what it said as early as its First Report (paragraph ) namely: "" The purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward "".Allegations concerning the Imprisonment of Mr. Barrisueta
.In a telegram dated  December , the plaintiffs had alleged that Alejandro Barrisueta, a leader of Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), had been incarcerated at La Paz with other miners' trade union leaders, and held incommunicado. Later, in a communication dated  January , they explained that Alejandro Barrisueta had been arrested on  December  and that on the th of that month the ASIB had applied for a writ of habeas corpus with a view to obtaining his release, since in the meantime the other arrested persons had been released. Following this application, the authorities had informed the ASIB that Barrisueta had been banished to Ixiamas. "" What is clear "" add the complainants "" is that according to the authorities, comrade Barrisueta was released on the night of  December. The information we have received shows that he was subjected to severe physical torture during his imprisonment, but the most serious part of the affair is that his whereabouts are unknown. All the signs suggest that Barrisueta is being held by the police so that the lamentable state he has been placed in by the torture shall not be known.""
.In its first reply, the Government merely confined itself to stating that Mr. Barrisueta was not registered as an officer of any trade union organisation in the country. Later, it said that Mr. Barrisueta "" was detained only for  hours during investigation of the possibility of his having taken part in the murder of a citizen, which is a crime under ordinary law in accordance with the general legislation of all countries "".
.At its session in May , the Committee recommended the Governing Body to urge the Government to reply to the statements made in the complaint, especially that concerning the mistreatment inflicted upon Mr. Barrisueta, and to state the whereabouts of Mr. Barrisueta. At its session in February , and again for the last time at its session in May , the Committee made similar recommendations to the Governing Body.
.The Government has so far not provided the information requested.Allegations concerning Elections in the Siglo XX Mines
.In a communication dated  December , the complaining organisation, making use of information provided by the ASIB, stated that on the occasion of the elections held in the Siglo XX mines, four groups had been seeking leadership of the union: the Independents, the official list, the ORIT, and the Christian Democratic Party. The representatives of the four groups had appeared before the Regional Labour Inspector for the Llallagua District to establish an agreement under which the winning group, whichever it might be, would be recognised by the Ministry of Labour in the exercise of its functions. According to the complainants, there was a breach of the agreement after the elections (won by the Independents); the Ministry of Labour had refused to recognise it and had insisted that the losing party (the official list) "" which was to be incorporated in the leadership to the extent of  per cent "" should represent the minority groups. The workers had refused to accept that arrangement and despite all efforts it had proved impossible to reach a peaceful settlement since the Ministry of Labour maintained an uncompromising attitude.
.Despite repeated appeals to the Government for its comments on this aspect of the case, none have been forthcoming.
.The Committee is aware that, since the events alleged to have taken place, there have been several changes of government in Bolivia.
.In this connection, the Committee recalls the principle which it has always emphasised, namely that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. Furthermore, should there be a change of government or political system in a country, the government of the day should take all the necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which the events on which the complaint is based may have had since its accession to power, even though those events took place under its predecessor.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the fact that the political system in Bolivia has changed since the events referred to by the complainants in the allegations;(b) to recall the principle whereby there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that, although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. Furthermore, should there be a change of government or political system in a country, the government of the day should take all the necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which the events on which the complaint is based may have had since its accession to power, even though those events took place under its predecessor;(c) to recall the comment made by the Committee, as early as its First Report, to the effect that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(d) to recall the principle that workers should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(e) to recall the importance which should be attached to the principle that all arrested persons should be subject to normal judicial procedure in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in accordance with the principle that it is a fundamental right of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, and the American Convention of Human Rights;(f) to deplore the fact that, despite repeated requests, the Government has failed to provide information concerning allegations, some of which are of a particularly serious",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
76,"nature, since they refer to the torture of an arrested trade union leader, and that consequently, it has been impossible for the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts; and(g) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain the information requested from it concerning the fate of Mr. Barrisueta.
.The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th report, as approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ). At its session in February  the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a further interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th report, as approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.To enable it to continue its examination of the case the Committee recommended the Governing Body (paragraph  of its th report) to ask the Government, as a matter of urgency, to supply detailed information and observations with regard to the allegations relating to the imprisonment and banishment of Mr. Barrisueta, a leader of the Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), and its observations on the facts alleged concerning the elections at the Siglo XX mines (paragraph  (e) and (f) of the th report). In a communication dated  February  the Government supplied further information relating to the case.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its latest communication, the Government confines itself to outlining, in general terms, the improved status of the trade union movement since the revolutionary regime came to power in Bolivia on  October . The Government further states that there are, at present, no political or trade union prisoners in Bolivia, and that the anti-labour policy of dissolving the leadership in the mining and industrial centres which was carried out by previous regimes has been completely reversed. The Government includes in its communication a copy of another communication received by it from the Bolivian Workers' Confederation (COB), which makes reference to the complaint before the Committee and adds that, despite the systematic persecution under previous regimes, workers' associations were able to remain intact although their activities and influence were limited as a result of the attitude of these governments. The Government contends that the complaint submitted by the World Confederation of Labour should now be examined in the light of this statement since, in the opinion of the Government, it clearly shows the present position of the Bolivian trade union organisations.
.The Committee feels obliged to point out that one of the principles established in the procedure for the examination of alleged infringements of trade union rights is that, where precise allegations are made, the Committee cannot regard as satisfactory replies from governments which are confined to generalities. It also draws the attention of the Government to the principle established in earlier cases that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor may have had since its accession to power. In the present case, the Committee is of the opinion that, while the new government cannot be held responsible for the events which gave rise to the complaint, the effects of the events which gave rise to the allegations concerning the imprisonment of Mr. Barrisueta and the elections at the Siglo XX mines could, without information to the contrary, be of a continuing nature.
.The Committee recalls that Mr. Barrisueta was alleged to have been arrested on  December , subjected to severe physical torture and banished, and, in view of the nature of this allegation, the Committee requested the Government to supply, as a matter of urgency, detailed information and its observations on the matters referred to in the complaint (paragraph  of the th report). As regards the allegation relating to the elections at the Siglo XX mines, which was contained in the communication of the complaining organisation dated  December , the Committee, at its session in February , having received no reply to its request for observations, again recommended the Governing Body (th report, paragraph  (f)) to invite the Government to send its observations on the facts alleged. No reply to either of these allegations has yet been received by the Committee.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore that, in spite of repeated requests made to the Government in this connection, no information has been supplied, and to invite the Government, as a matter of urgency, to supply detailed information and observations on these two aspects of the complaint, and especially on the present situation of Mr. Barrisueta; and(b) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received this information and these observations.
.The Committee examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, as approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ).
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee submitted recommendations to the Governing Body for the purpose of inviting the Government and the complainant organisation to send specific information and observations, to enable it to continue its examination of the case. The Government sent information, dated  May , relating to one aspect of the case, but this communication was not received by the Committee in time to be examined at its meeting in May . The World Confederation of Labour, for its part, submitted further allegations in a communication dated  May , on which the Government submitted its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to workers' radio stations, to decide that no new evidence has been submitted which would justify re-examination of the matter, with a view to modifying the conclusions of the Committee contained in paragraph  of its th Report;(b) as regards the allegations relating to Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo, subject to further examination in the context of Cases ,  and  (Bolivia) of Mr. Lechin Oquendo's position with regard to the proceedings brought against him, to take note of the Government's statement that he has not been exiled and is free to return to the country if he wishes to defend himself against these charges, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the denial of recognition to various trade union organisations by the Government:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle contained in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Bolivia and guarantees workers the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation; in Article  of the Convention, which provides that such organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, the public authorities refraining from any interference which would restrict that right or impede the lawful exercise thereof; and in Article  of the Convention, providing that these organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(ii) to invite the Government to adopt, with the least possible delay, the necessary measures to enable workers belonging to the trade union organisations referred to in the allegations to elect their representatives freely and to enable such organisations, after complying with mere requirements as to form, to obtain the legal recognition which will enable them once more to pursue their activities freely without interference by the authorities;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the denial of the right to organise to various categories of worker:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , which guarantees to all workers "" without distinction whatsoever "" the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing;(ii) to invite the Government to adopt the necessary measures effectively to recognise the right of public officials, craftsmen, and heads and administrative personnel of schools to form organisations;(e) with regard to the allegations relating to the imprisonment of Mr. Barrisueta, bearing in mind the nature of the complaints, in particular the allegation that he was subject to mistreatment, and",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
77,"to his banishment, to ask the Government to be good enough, as a matter of urgency, to supply detailed information and its observations with respect to the statements made in the complaint, and especially, to indicate the present whereabouts of Mr. Barrisueta;(f) as regards the allegations relating to the elections at the Siglo XX mines, to ask the Government, once again, to send its observations on the facts alleged as soon as possible;(g) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the present case;(h) to take note of the present report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested from the Government and referred to under (e) and (f) of this paragraph.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour is contained in three communications dated  December ,  December  and  January . The text of each of these communications was forwarded on receipt to the Government, which has made its observations on them in a communication dated  March .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants alleged in a telegram dated  December  that Mr. Alejandro Barrisueta, a leader of the Bolivian Trade Union Action (ASIB), which is affiliated to the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists, itself affiliated to the World Confederation of Labour, had been arrested and imprisoned at La Paz with other miners' leaders and held incommunicado.
.In a letter dated  January  the complainants give the following details concerning this aspect of the affair. Mr. Barrisueta and many other active trade unionists were arrested on  December ; on  December the ASIB applied for a writ of habeas corpus with a view to securing the release of Mr. Barrisueta, since all the other arrested workers had been released "" thanks to pressure by the workers, by various advanced elements in the country and by international organisations and to intervention by the Bolivian Catholic Church "".
.When the writ of habeas corpus had been applied for to secure the release of Mr. Barrisueta, the complainants go on the Bolivian authorities informed the ASIB that he had been banished to Ixiamas. "" The sole purpose of this measure "", the complainants asserted, "" was to avoid his appearing before the law courts.""
."" What is clear "", they continue, "" is that, according to the authorities, Mr. Barrisueta was released on the night of  December. The information we have received shows that he was subjected to severe physical torture during his imprisonment, but the most serious part of the affair is that his whereabouts are unknown. All the signs suggest that Mr. Barrisueta is being held by the police so that the lamentable physical state he has been placed in by the torture shall not be known. ""
.Another aspect of the case can be seen in the communication dated  December  from the complainant organisation, which gives information supplied to it by the ASIB. On the occasion of elections held in the Siglo XX mines, four groups were seeking the leadership of the union: the independents, the official list, the GRIT and the Christian Democrat Party. The representatives of the four groups appeared before the Regional Labour Inspector for the Llallagua district to establish an agreement that the winning group, whichever it might be, would be recognised by the Ministry of Labour in the exercise of its functions.
.The independents gained the election by a large majority, "" since it genuinely represents the mining working class, which has full confidence in its leadership "". It appears, however, that the agreement has been violated by the Government, through the Ministry of Labour, which refuses to recognise the managing committee and insists that the minority group, namely the official list, shall be incorporated in it to the extent of  per cent.
.The workers, according to the complainants, do not accept this arrangement and have taken many steps to have it annulled. All attempts at a peaceful settlement have been exhausted, all attempts to establish a dialogue and understanding with the Ministry of Labour have been useless, and the Ministry maintains its uncompromising position.
.The Government, in its observations, begins by stating that it is not unusual for professional agitators, working against the background of Castro-communist guerrilla warfare, to endeavour both inside and outside the country to cloak their subversive activities by making accusations before the international organisations concerning the violation of human and trade union rights in Bolivia. These procedures, the Government continues, are intended to maintain a persistent violation of the national laws and to create a climate of anarchy and chaos in the country.
.In reply to the allegations that have been made, the Government confines itself to stating that Mr. Barrisueta is not registered as an officer of any trade union organisation recognised in the country and that the ASIB has no legal existence, since it has no documents establishing its legal personality, a fact that excludes its assuming the right to represent the workers.
.The Government therefore ends by suggesting that the Committee should first determine the legal status of the ASIB and that it is only when the Government has seen the findings of the Committee in this connection that it will be able to deal officially with any request for information and observations.
.The Government, in its present observations, appears to suggest that, since the ASIB has no legal existence, the allegations contained in the present complaint are inadmissible.
.A first comment is called for. If, in the absence of recognition by the authorities or of registration-which itself may be the result of a failure by the organisation concerned or of a refusal by the authorities-or for any other reason, ASIB has no legal existence, it nevertheless has a de facto existence as borne out by its membership of an organisation affiliated to the complainant organisation.
.A second, even more important observation must be made. The complainant is not in fact the ASIB but the World Confederation of Labour, an organisation that has consultative status with the ILO and in relation to which no question of receivability can arise.
.In these circumstances-and in view of the extreme seriousness of some of the allegations made-the Committee considers that it ought to recommend the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to be good enough to reply without delay to the allegations that Mr. Barrisueta has been arrested and tortured and to state where he is at present;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to present its observations concerning the allegations analysed in paragraphs  to  above relating to the trade union elections carried out in the Siglo XX mines;(c) to request the complainant organisation to be good enough to give all relevant information concerning the trade union functions of Mr. Barrisueta;(d) to take note of this interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will submit a new report when it is in possession of the information specified in the three preceding subparagraphs.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",-1,1968,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
78,".These three cases were last examined by the Committee at its session in November  (th Report, paragraphs  to ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report containing the Committee's conclusions on certain aspects of the case which remained outstanding at that time. The Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply additional information concerning certain other aspects of the case (paragraph  (b) and (c) of the th Report).
.The aspects of the case concerning which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request additional information were the trial or exile of certain trade unionists in , and the events which occurred in  during which workers were killed. In particular, the Committee had noted that certain trade unionists, namely Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes, who had been charged with common law offences, were awaiting trial, and the Government was requested to supply information on the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons. The Government was also requested to inform the Governing Body, as soon as possible, of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibility of legally re-entering the country. The Committee had occasion, at its session in February  (th Report, paragraphs  to ) to examine the case concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the context of Case No. , since the Government had supplied certain information regarding this person. It will be recalled that the Committee, in view of the information received, recommended the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the further examination of the proceedings against Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the present cases, this aspect of the case did not call for further examination. As regards the events of  in which workers were killed, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation ordered by the Government and to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn (a trade union leader against whom proceedings were instituted in respect of various offences), together with the grounds for this judgment.
.At its various sessions since November  the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases since the Government had not supplied all the information requested.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication addressed to the Director-General of the ILO by the Government dated  December , the Government stated that the revolutionary government which came into power on  September  adopted certain measures which were of relevance in assessing the trade union situation. These measures, the Government stated, were as follows: (a) no persons were in prison for reasons of political or trade union activities; (b) the Chancellery of the Republic had been instructed to authorise ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return; (c) the Minister of the Interior had also received instructions to expedite the trials of any persons against whom legal proceedings had been instituted under previous regimes.
.The Committee feels bound to express its concern that in spite of repeated requests to the Government for information concerning the cases of Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, this information has not yet been communicated by the Government. The Committee likewise expresses its concern that the Government has so far failed to supply the information requested concerning the outcome of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed. In the absence of such information, the Committee finds itself unable to reach definitive conclusions regarding these aspects of the complaints. The Committee wishes to recall in this connection that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. This purpose cannot readily be achieved unless co-operation is obtained from both complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.Furthermore, the Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions. The Committee also points out that the communication of the texts of judgments given in such cases and the grounds on which these are based provide useful information enabling the Committee to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In all the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that instructions have been given authorising ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraph  above regarding the observance of the right of trade unionists to receive a prompt and fair trial, and the communication of the texts of judgments to the Committee;(c) to express serious regret that, in spite of repeated requests for information concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, as well as the results of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed, this information has not been received, which prevents the Committee from reaching definite conclusions regarding these aspects of the case;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure of the Committee on Freedom of Association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that this purpose cannot be readily achieved unless co-operation is obtained both from complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or to refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.These three cases have already been examined at previous meetings of the Committee, when it submitted to the Governing Body a number of interim reports containing the Committee's conclusions on various aspects of the questions raised.
.This report refers only to those aspects which are still outstanding and on which the Governing Body, at the Committee's recommendation, had requested certain additional observations and information from the Government.
.In a communication dated  July  the Government replied to these requests.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the dissolution of trade unions, to note the information supplied by the Government, according to which, on the one hand, the provision-called in question by the complainants-whereby sabotage was included in the grounds for dissolving trade unions has been repealed, and, on the other hand, by virtue of a decree of  trade union organisations can only be dissolved through a court, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or exile of trade unionists in :(i) to note the fact that Mr. Ortiz, against whom legal action was being taken, was released under an amnesty;(ii) to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to ensuring adequate safeguards in order to prevent compulsory residence measures from being used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(iii) to note the information supplied by the Government according to which the majority of the persons named in the complaints had neither been arrested nor imprisoned and only Mr. Lechn Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes are awaiting trial, charged with common law offences, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibilities of legally re-entering the country;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the events of June , in which workers were killed, to request the Government to be good enough:(i) to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation as soon as this has been concluded;(ii) to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn, together with the grounds for this judgment, as",-1,1967,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
79,"soon as it is passed;(d) with regard to the allegations concerning the occupying of trade union premises and the closing down of trade union radio transmitting stations:(i) to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that the trade union premises which had been temporarily occupied have now been restored to the workers;(ii) to decide, subject to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, that the allegation concerning the closing down of radio transmitting stations does not call for further examination;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the additional information requested from the Government in this paragraph.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (C.L.A.S.C.), the World Federation of Trade Unions (W.F.T.U.) and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) dated  June,  July and  July  respectively, which were sent directly to the I.L.O. In a communication dated  August  the C.L.A.S.C made new allegations relating to the case. All of these communications were transmitted to the Government.
.By a communication dated  July  the Secretariat of the Latin American Workers' Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity submitted allegations concerning the same questions as those referred to by the organisations mentioned in paragraph  above. In a letter dated  July  the Director-General requested the said Secretariat to state whether the Latin American Workers' Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity has any affiliates in Bolivia. Despite the time that has passed since then, this letter has remained unanswered.
.In a communication dated  September  the Government sent its observations relating to the complaints, the texts of which had been transmitted to it.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June  the C.L.A.S.C asked the I.L.O to intervene in order to obtain the release of a miners' leader, Mr. Waldo Tarqui, and other trade union leaders who, it stated, had been imprisoned. In its communication of  August  the C.L.A.S.C stated that Mr. Waldo Tarqui (trade union leader at the San Jos mine), Mr. Constancio Apaza and Mr. Ren Cumgoza (trade union leaders at Catavi) were being held in a concentration camp and that Mr. Ren Chacn (trade union leader at Siglo XX), who had been arrested with the others on  June, had since been obliged to leave the country.
.The W.F.T.U, the I.F.C.T.U and the C.L.A.S.C, in their communications of  July,  July and  August  respectively, all state that military forces attacked the mineworkers in June . According to the I.F.C.T.U, a group of miners who, accompanied by their wives and children, were waiting for a workers' meeting to begin on  June were surprised by a military detachment which fired on them and killed a large number of people. It is further alleged that Mr. Tarqui, one of the leaders of the Bolivian Trade Union Action Movement, was arrested on that occasion. According to the W.F.T.U, the persons at the meeting on  June were strikers and  of them were killed and  wounded, while  trade union leaders were arrested.
.The complaints also refer to the alleged occupation of trade union premises and radio transmitting stations by the army. The I.F.C.T.U asserts that, far from improving, the situation of the Bolivian workers appears to be worsening owing in particular to the repressive measures taken "" by the military Government "".
.In its communication of  September  the Government states, "" in order to avoid distortion of the truth "", that, in view of indications of disturbances, the Government was compelled to declare a state of siege at the beginning of June, thus suspending individual rights and guarantees. It goes on to indicate that this preventive measure was not respected in the mining centres of Huanuni, Catavi and Siglo XX where subversive activity even increased. Some mining districts had declared themselves "" free territories "", which the Government describes as a false notion that led to resistance against legal measures and against the entry of the forces of order into the mining areas arbitrarily and unlawfully declared free.
.The Government continues by stating that the right to strike is embodied as a Constitutional right in Bolivia but that subversion disregards law and order, which was what happened on  and  June, since the entry of troops into the mining areas, on orders received from the authorities, was opposed by the agents of subversion, who "" immediately used firearms and caused casualties among the forces of order "", thus explaining the armed confrontation in which the troops "" answered force with force in justifiable self-defence "". The Government states that the regrettable casualties were the consequence of ideas and aims totally foreign to trade union interests and that several of those arrested have long since ceased to work in the mining centres of Catavi, Siglo XX and Huanuni and cannot therefore be considered as trade union members or leaders.
.The Government further states that trade union privilege does not protect acts which constitute offences under the Penal Code.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, in accordance with its powers, is engaged in defending the legitimate rights of all workers and is at present devoting the utmost attention to improving the living conditions and legal protection of workers in the mining sector.
.The Government rejects the allegation contained in the complaints that it has violated trade union rights and democratic freedoms recognised by international Conventions. It also protests at the terms used in the complaints transmitted to it, which it considers improper.
.As regards this last point, the Committee wishes merely to point out, as it has done in other cases, that the character of the task entrusted to it demands that both governments and complainants should avoid using language calculated to embitter rather than to elucidate controversy and that, in replying to a request for observations on a complaint, a government is not acknowledging the propriety, still less the validity, of the complaint, but is simply co-operating with the Committee and the Governing Body in making possible an impartial examination of the matter.
.The Committee recalls that, in examining on a previous occasion Case No.  relating to Bolivia, it had before it allegations relating to similar events that had occurred in the Bolivian mining centres in May . On that occasion, on the basis of the evidence available (partly supplied by the same complainants), from which it appeared, inter alia, that the armed resistance movement accompanying the strike had exceeded the limits of strike action, the Committee did not consider that the measures adopted by the Government in order to overcome such resistance permitted any allegation of violation of trade union rights to be made in the case mentioned.
.In the present case, with regard to the serious events which, according to the complainants and the Government, did in fact take place in June , the Committee notes that, in answer to the complainants' allegation that a meeting of workers and members of their families was attacked by military forces, the Government replies that, at a time when a state of siege had been declared and Constitutional rights were therefore suspended, the miners had proclaimed "" free territories "" in certain districts and resisted the entry of the forces of order, opening fire on them.
.The question raised in the present case does not therefore appear to refer specifically to the strike but to the deaths and arrests alleged to have resulted from the intervention of the armed forces.
.In similar cases a in which it has been alleged that people have been killed when the police opened fire on strikers the Committee has recalled that, where the dispersal of public assemblies, etc., by the police on grounds of public order or similar grounds has involved loss of life, it attaches special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated by an immediate and independent special inquiry and to regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification and responsibility for the action taken by the police.
.On the other hand, the Government has not sent any specific observations concerning the arrest of the four trade union leaders mentioned in the complaints and has merely stated that some of the persons arrested cannot be considered as trade union members or leaders, no longer being mineworkers. The Government's assertion, even if proved to be true, would not automatically imply that the persons in question can no longer be considered as trade union leaders if the workers had selected them as their leaders. When it examined on a previous occasion Case No.  relating to Bolivia r, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, drew the Government's attention to the fact that certain",-1,1967,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
80,"provisions requiring that the election of trade union leaders should be subject to their being actively employed by the undertaking concerned and stating that a trade union leader should forfeit his right to office upon ceasing to be an employee of the undertaking were inconsistent with the right of all workers to elect their representatives in full freedom that is guaranteed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which Bolivia has ratified.
.The Committee therefore considers it necessary to request the Government to provide specific observations as soon as possible with regard to the arrest of Mr. Waldo Tarqui, Mr. Constancio Apaza, Mr. Ren Cumgoza and Mr. Ren Chacn and, in particular, to state the present situation of those persons before the law.
.In conclusion, the Committee notes that the Government has made no observations regarding the allegations that the Government has occupied trade union premises and radio transmitting stations.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government:(i) to inform it whether any investigation has been carried out, followed by due judicial proceedings, in order to determine the responsibility for the deaths which occurred during the events of June  to which the complaints refer, and, if so, to inform it of the results of such investigation;(ii) to furnish specific observations regarding the alleged arrest of the four trade union leaders named by the complainants and regarding the present situation of those persons before the law;(iii) to send its observations regarding the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above;(b) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the supplementary information and observations requested from the Government in subparagraph (a) above.",-1,1967,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
81,".These three cases were last examined by the Committee at its session in November  (th Report, paragraphs  to ), when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report containing the Committee's conclusions on certain aspects of the case which remained outstanding at that time. The Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply additional information concerning certain other aspects of the case (paragraph  (b) and (c) of the th Report).
.The aspects of the case concerning which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request additional information were the trial or exile of certain trade unionists in , and the events which occurred in  during which workers were killed. In particular, the Committee had noted that certain trade unionists, namely Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes, who had been charged with common law offences, were awaiting trial, and the Government was requested to supply information on the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons. The Government was also requested to inform the Governing Body, as soon as possible, of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibility of legally re-entering the country. The Committee had occasion, at its session in February  (th Report, paragraphs  to ) to examine the case concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the context of Case No. , since the Government had supplied certain information regarding this person. It will be recalled that the Committee, in view of the information received, recommended the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the further examination of the proceedings against Mr. Lechin Oquendo in the present cases, this aspect of the case did not call for further examination. As regards the events of  in which workers were killed, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation ordered by the Government and to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn (a trade union leader against whom proceedings were instituted in respect of various offences), together with the grounds for this judgment.
.At its various sessions since November  the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases since the Government had not supplied all the information requested.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a communication addressed to the Director-General of the ILO by the Government dated  December , the Government stated that the revolutionary government which came into power on  September  adopted certain measures which were of relevance in assessing the trade union situation. These measures, the Government stated, were as follows: (a) no persons were in prison for reasons of political or trade union activities; (b) the Chancellery of the Republic had been instructed to authorise ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return; (c) the Minister of the Interior had also received instructions to expedite the trials of any persons against whom legal proceedings had been instituted under previous regimes.
.The Committee feels bound to express its concern that in spite of repeated requests to the Government for information concerning the cases of Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, this information has not yet been communicated by the Government. The Committee likewise expresses its concern that the Government has so far failed to supply the information requested concerning the outcome of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed. In the absence of such information, the Committee finds itself unable to reach definitive conclusions regarding these aspects of the complaints. The Committee wishes to recall in this connection that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. This purpose cannot readily be achieved unless co-operation is obtained from both complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.Furthermore, the Committee wishes to recall that on several occasions it has emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions. The Committee also points out that the communication of the texts of judgments given in such cases and the grounds on which these are based provide useful information enabling the Committee to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In all the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement that instructions have been given authorising ambassadors to issue visas to any citizens now outside the country for political reasons and wishing to return;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles expressed in paragraph  above regarding the observance of the right of trade unionists to receive a prompt and fair trial, and the communication of the texts of judgments to the Committee;(c) to express serious regret that, in spite of repeated requests for information concerning Mr. Lechin Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Chacn, as well as the results of the judicial investigation into the events of June  in which workers were killed, this information has not been received, which prevents the Committee from reaching definite conclusions regarding these aspects of the case;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure of the Committee on Freedom of Association is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that this purpose cannot be readily achieved unless co-operation is obtained both from complainants and governments in the communication of information either to substantiate or to refute specific allegations, thus enabling the Committee to arrive at definitive conclusions in each case.
.These three cases have already been examined at previous meetings of the Committee, when it submitted to the Governing Body a number of interim reports containing the Committee's conclusions on various aspects of the questions raised.
.This report refers only to those aspects which are still outstanding and on which the Governing Body, at the Committee's recommendation, had requested certain additional observations and information from the Government.
.In a communication dated  July  the Government replied to these requests.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the dissolution of trade unions, to note the information supplied by the Government, according to which, on the one hand, the provision-called in question by the complainants-whereby sabotage was included in the grounds for dissolving trade unions has been repealed, and, on the other hand, by virtue of a decree of  trade union organisations can only be dissolved through a court, and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or exile of trade unionists in :(i) to note the fact that Mr. Ortiz, against whom legal action was being taken, was released under an amnesty;(ii) to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to ensuring adequate safeguards in order to prevent compulsory residence measures from being used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(iii) to note the information supplied by the Government according to which the majority of the persons named in the complaints had neither been arrested nor imprisoned and only Mr. Lechn Oquendo, Mr. Quispe, Mr. Pimentel and Mr. Reyes are awaiting trial, charged with common law offences, and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the results of the proceedings instituted against these four persons;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible of the position before the law of the trade unionists who, according to the complainants, were exiled in , as well as on their possibilities of legally re-entering the country;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the events of June , in which workers were killed, to request the Government to be good enough:(i) to keep it informed of the results of the judicial investigation as soon as this has been concluded;(ii) to supply the text of the judgment in the case against Mr. Chacn, together with the grounds for this judgment, as",-1,1965,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
82,"soon as it is passed;(d) with regard to the allegations concerning the occupying of trade union premises and the closing down of trade union radio transmitting stations:(i) to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that the trade union premises which had been temporarily occupied have now been restored to the workers;(ii) to decide, subject to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, that the allegation concerning the closing down of radio transmitting stations does not call for further examination;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the additional information requested from the Government in this paragraph.
.The Committee has found it convenient to deal in a single paper with these three cases concerning Bolivia, in which, following the Committee's submission of certain conclusions to the Governing Body in earlier reports which were approved, certain allegations' are still outstanding and additional information on them has been sought from the Government.
.As regards Cases Nos.  and , the Government furnished certain information in a letter dated  August .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the assault on Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo (August ), to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that no useful purpose would be served by continuing its examination of these allegations;(b) with regard to the compulsory residence measures, to emphasise to the Government in general terms the importance it has always attached to the need for accompanying the compulsory residence procedure with all necessary safeguards, so that it cannot be used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest and exile of trade unionists in :(i) to take note of the Government's statement that Mr. Orlando Capriles Villazn is now at liberty and Mr. Arturo Crespo is provisionally at liberty;(ii) to note that Mr. Juan Alberto Ortiz is under arrest and awaiting trial by the ordinary courts and to request the Government to be good enough to forward a copy of the judgment together with the grounds adduced therein, once it is given;(iii) to request the Government once more to be good enough to give details as early as possible concerning the offences which, according to an earlier statement by the Government, led to the arrest and exile of Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo, together with information concerning the present position before the law of the persons listed in paragraph  above and to be good enough, should the individuals concerned be under arrest, subjected to a compulsory residence order or in exile, to state the exact nature of the actions which led to these measures being taken and the outcome of any judicial proceedings instituted in their case;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to specify as early as possible the provisions now in force concerning the dissolution of trade unions and, should sabotage still be a ground for dissolution, the penalties now in force in the country with respect to that offence;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this paragraph.
.The Committee considers that it would be useful and convenient to deal in a single document with these two cases referring to Bolivia, which it now has under examination. Case No.  deals with the assault that, according to a complaint by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, was made in August  on Mr. Juan Lechn, head of this Confederation. Case No.  deals with the complaints made by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation and the World Federation of Trade Unions concerning alleged repressive measures taken in May  by the Military Junta against trade union organisations and leaders.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the cases as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the assault committed in August  on Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo, while deploring that, in spite of the numerous requests addressed to it by the Committee, the Government has sent no information since April  concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against those responsible for the assault, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the necessary information as soon as possible;(b) in respect of the allegations concerning the events of May :(i) to take note of the statements by the Government that Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo was arrested and deported on account of criminal acts punishable under the Penal Code;(ii) to request the Government to be good enough, having regard to the principles enunciated in paragraph  and  above, to inform it of the exact nature of the offences with which Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo was charged and to state whether he was tried on those charges before an impartial and independent judicial authority;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish specific observations on the alleged detention or exiling of the trade unionists named in the complaint of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation dated  July  and that of the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  December ;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to state whether the political amnesty declared by the Decree of  May  affects Mr. Lechn Oquendo and the other trade unionists referred to in clause (iii) above or not and, if it does, to state how this measure has affected the exercise by these persons of their trade union rights;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information to be requested of the Government in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) (ii), (iii) and (iv), of this paragraph.",-1,1965,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

.The complaint by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists (C.L.A.S.C.) was submitted in a direct letter to the I.L.O dated  July . It was forwarded to the Government, which sent in its observations on  September .

.The Confederation's letter dated  July  was accompanied by copies of four presidential decrees: No.  dated  May , No.  dated  May  and Nos.  and  dated  June .
.In all the circumstances, and having regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the provisions of Decrees Nos. ,  and  referring to intervention by the public authorities at the different stages of the procedure of electing trade union officials are incompatible with the guarantees to which trade unions are entitled under the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Bolivia, and to suggest therefore that the Government should consider amending them so as to enable workers' organisations to elect their representatives freely, the public authorities being obliged to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the provisions of Decrees Nos. ,  and  preventing the re-election of trade union officials and attaching other conditions to their election (being actively employed by the undertaking concerned, and not having been sentenced for an offence) are inconsistent with the right guaranteed by the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), to all workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, and to suggest in consequence that the Government examine the possibility of amending these provisions so as to enable workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the importance it has always attached to the principle that workers and employers should have the right to establish and to join organisations "" of their own choosing "", as laid down by Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which has been ratified by Bolivia, and to suggest in consequence to the Government that it consider amending Decree No.  to bring it into line with the aforementioned principle;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the provision of Decree No.  preventing the forming of proper trade unions in recently established undertakings is not in keeping with the principle laid down by Article  of Convention No.  that all workers should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing, and to suggest that its amendment be considered so as to enable all workers to establish their own organisations in accordance with the aforementioned principle;(e) to request the Government to inform the Committee as to what are the exact provisions in force in the country as regards penal sanctions for sabotage, and to decide in the meantime to postpone examination of this aspect of the case;(f) to bring the foregoing conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.Geneva,  November .

85,".The Committee has found it convenient to deal in a single paper with these three cases concerning Bolivia, in which, following the Committee's submission of certain conclusions to the Governing Body in earlier reports which were approved, certain allegations' are still outstanding and additional information on them has been sought from the Government.
.As regards Cases Nos.  and , the Government furnished certain information in a letter dated  August .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the assault on Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo (August ), to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, that no useful purpose would be served by continuing its examination of these allegations;(b) with regard to the compulsory residence measures, to emphasise to the Government in general terms the importance it has always attached to the need for accompanying the compulsory residence procedure with all necessary safeguards, so that it cannot be used as a means of impairing the free exercise of trade union rights;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest and exile of trade unionists in :(i) to take note of the Government's statement that Mr. Orlando Capriles Villazn is now at liberty and Mr. Arturo Crespo is provisionally at liberty;(ii) to note that Mr. Juan Alberto Ortiz is under arrest and awaiting trial by the ordinary courts and to request the Government to be good enough to forward a copy of the judgment together with the grounds adduced therein, once it is given;(iii) to request the Government once more to be good enough to give details as early as possible concerning the offences which, according to an earlier statement by the Government, led to the arrest and exile of Mr. Juan Lechin Oquendo, together with information concerning the present position before the law of the persons listed in paragraph  above and to be good enough, should the individuals concerned be under arrest, subjected to a compulsory residence order or in exile, to state the exact nature of the actions which led to these measures being taken and the outcome of any judicial proceedings instituted in their case;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to specify as early as possible the provisions now in force concerning the dissolution of trade unions and, should sabotage still be a ground for dissolution, the penalties now in force in the country with respect to that offence;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this paragraph.
.The Committee considers that it would be useful and convenient to deal in a single document with these two cases referring to Bolivia, which it now has under examination. Case No.  deals with the assault that, according to a complaint by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, was made in August  on Mr. Juan Lechn, head of this Confederation. Case No.  deals with the complaints made by the Bolivian Workers' Confederation and the World Federation of Trade Unions concerning alleged repressive measures taken in May  by the Military Junta against trade union organisations and leaders.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the cases as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) in respect of the allegations relating to the assault committed in August  on Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo, while deploring that, in spite of the numerous requests addressed to it by the Committee, the Government has sent no information since April  concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against those responsible for the assault, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the necessary information as soon as possible;(b) in respect of the allegations concerning the events of May :(i) to take note of the statements by the Government that Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo was arrested and deported on account of criminal acts punishable under the Penal Code;(ii) to request the Government to be good enough, having regard to the principles enunciated in paragraph  and  above, to inform it of the exact nature of the offences with which Mr. Juan Lechn Oquendo was charged and to state whether he was tried on those charges before an impartial and independent judicial authority;(iii) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish specific observations on the alleged detention or exiling of the trade unionists named in the complaint of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation dated  July  and that of the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  December ;(iv) to request the Government to be good enough to state whether the political amnesty declared by the Decree of  May  affects Mr. Lechn Oquendo and the other trade unionists referred to in clause (iii) above or not and, if it does, to state how this measure has affected the exercise by these persons of their trade union rights;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information to be requested of the Government in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) (ii), (iii) and (iv), of this paragraph.",-1,1964,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
86,".In this letter the Government declares that, in order to permit an impartial study of the allegations presented, it submits to the International Labour Organisation the following data:(a) True trade union organisation, that is to say the organisation of those elements among the workers which only seek the improvement of their lot, independently of harmful political activities, is effectively guaranteed and enjoys the support of the public authorities. Article  of the Constitution, furthermore, expressly recognises it.(b) On the other hand, activities whose sole object is to overthrow the present democratic Government under the pretext of "" freedom of association "" must be suppressed by the Government, whose imperative duty it is to secure its own preservation and the preservation of democratic institutions.(c) The general labour law and the Decree applying that law clearly establish the objectives of all trade unions (including, for example, representation of trade unions in collective agreements and in cases of conciliation and arbitration, the establishment of insurance funds, the organisation of cooperatives, etc.) ; they do not state that "" trade union "" objectives include the propagation of communist doctrine, insurrection against a Government based on popular support or the maintenance of a permanent spirit of revolution among trade union members leading to the commission of abominable crimes. The Bolivian State recognises trade union rights when they are exercised "" in accordance with law "", as is expressly provided in Article  of the Constitution. Article , however, provides that "" trade unions are forbidden to deal with other questions than those previously enumerated "".(d) The signatories of the complaints, who improperly call themselves "" leaders "" of the Bolivian Federation of Miners' Unions, are in reality the heads of revolutionary movements aiming at the overthrow of the Government and not at the protection of the legitimate rights of workers. The "" Thesis of Pulacayo "", the charter of the Revolutionary Workers' Party, which was approved by the congress of Bolivian miners, and which is invoked by the signatories, is not at all democratic since it is a synthesis of the most extreme and cynical communist rgime. In substantiation of its statement, the Government imputes to certain signatories of the complaint the personal commission of repeated acts of violence (in particular organisation of the ""assault groups "" in the mines for the purpose of taking forcible possession of the latter, armed attacks on a barracks, mining of communication lines, etc.).(e) The Government also refers to the Amnesty Law of  September  stating that if there were exceptions they were made in conformity with the very theory of amnesty which is intended to apply in cases of purely political events but which cannot be applied to ordinary misdemeanours. In such cases it is logical to await the decision of the ordinary courts. This law therefore is not a "" cruel mockery "", since it is the Bolivian people themselves who demand the punishment of those who for more than three years have troubled the peace and legally constituted order of the Bolivian Republic.
.In conclusion, the Government states that there can be no question of violation of trade union rights since the repressing action of the Government has not been directed against those trade union activities which are protected by the State but against revolutionary activities having for sole purpose the overthrow of the Constitutional Government and the establishment of a communist dictatorship. Accordingly, it expresses the hope that the International Labour Organisation, whose prestige and merit it recognises, may judge "" how false is the position of the former leaders of the miners who have wished to abuse its good faith "".
.In this letter the Bolivian Government sets forth the following considerations:(a) Since May  Bolivia has been governed by a Military Board, and all trade union organisations without exception enjoy full freedom and receive extensive co-operation in the development of their activities which are genuinely concerned with trade union matters. Furthermore, the trade unions and federations have publicly adopted resolutions expressing the satisfaction of the workers with the policy of social justice followed by the authorities at present in power.(b) The Government refers to the letter of  January , analysed above, which was sent to the International Labour Organisation by the Government which preceded it, in order to enable the Organisation to "" make an impartial study of the attitude of those authorities toward trade union rights "".(c) Measures will be taken to achieve progress in labour legislation in conformity with the recommendations and resolutions of the International Labour Organisation as also with the recommendations of the technical assistance mission of the United Nations headed by Dr. Keenleyside, taking into account the particular conditions obtaining in Bolivia.(d) The ratification by the new Bolivian Government of the instrument amending the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation constitutes further proof of this Government's aspiration towards social justice.
.The present case arises in very special circumstances.
.The complaints communicated to the Government of Bolivia all have reference to a situation of fact which existed previous to the Constitution of the present Government.
.The present Government indicates in its letter of  January  that henceforward "" all the country's trade unions without exception whatsoever enjoy full freedom and receive extensive co-operation in the development of their activities which are genuinely concerned with trade union matters "" ; that it has, as a "" proof of its aspiration toward social justice "", ratified the instrument amending the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation; and that "" measures will be taken to achieve progress in labour legislation for the benefit of the workers of Bolivia by the organisation of Government labour services in accordance with the Recommendations and resolutions of the International Labour Organisation and the Recommendations of the United Nations Technical Assistance Mission led by Dr. Keenleyside, taking into account the particular needs "" of the country.
.The mission led by Dr. Keenleyside to which the letter of the Bolivian Government refers was constituted under the aegis of the United Nations with the co-operation of certain specialised agencies, including the International Labour Organisation. An agreement between the United Nations and the Bolivian Government for the implementation of certain of the Recommendations made by the mission provides for the appointment by the Bolivian Government of a certain number of advisers nominated by the competent international organisations to assist the Government in its programme of social and economic development and reform. Two such advisers have been appointed on the nomination of the International Labour Office. The United Nations and specialised agencies co-operating with the Bolivian Government are represented in Bolivia by a special United Nations Representative for Technical Assistance who is a former Chairman of the Governing Body.
.Since the Bolivian Government expressly refers in its letter of  January  to the letter of  January  sent by the preceding Government, it would appear to recognise the continuity which exists before inter national bodies between the preceding and present Governments. Though the latter can obviously not be held responsible for events which took place under its predecessor, it clearly is responsible for any continuing consequences which they may have had since its accession to power.
.Bearing in mind these diverse considerations, the Committee, while recognising that the matter may have had a political character, regrets that serious interference with trade union rights would appear to have occurred under the preceding Government, and expresses the hope that the assurances given by the present Government will result in satisfactory protection for trade union rights ; in regard to the present situation, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide:(a) To express to the present Bolivian Government its appreciation of the information furnished in its letter of  January , which indicates particularly that measures are to be taken to achieve progress in labour legislation.(b) To draw its attention in this connection to the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , the desirability of ratifying which might usefully be considered by the Bolivian Government.(c) To request the Director-General to communicate the part of this report concerning the case of Bolivia, together with all the documents relative to the case, to the United Nations Representative for Technical Assistance accredited to the Bolivian Government for information, in the hope that it may be taken into account in the course of the technical co-operation between the United Nations and the specialised agencies and the Bolivian Government.Geneva,  March .",-1,1950,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
