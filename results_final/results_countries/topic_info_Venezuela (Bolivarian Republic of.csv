The Government points out that Mr Garmendia was treated courteously by the SEBIN officials who questioned him, and it requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this matter.(ii) The Government also indicates that no organization is currently shadowing or harassing former FEDECAMARAS president Mr Jorge Roig; it therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of the allegation.(iii) The Government denies the allegation of an escalation of the alleged attacks against FEDECAMARAS and indicates that there are no attacks or instances of persecution, harassment, intimidation or stigmatization against FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and members.(iv) As regards the alleged adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS, the Government indicates that the discussion of laws and bills comes within the competence of the National Assembly and that national socio-economic policy comes within the competence of the Executive, in coordination with the other branches of government, without limiting the mechanisms for consultation and broad social dialogue that already exist and are implemented with the various sectors. Furthermore, the Government again reports to the Committee that article () of the Constitution grants the President of the Republic the possibility, subject to authorization under an enabling act, of issuing decrees with the force of law, indicating that enabling acts must be approved by three-fifths of the members of the National Assembly, in order to establish guidelines, objectives and the framework for matters delegated to the President of the Republic.\n.As regards recommendation (g) (allegations of the detention of employers or leaders), the Government makes the following observations:(i) In the case of the  Da a Da Practimercados' supermarket chain, the Government reports that on  February  an inspection of the supermarket chain was carried out by a presidential commission and the Office of the National Superintendent for the Defence of Socio-Economic Rights (SUNDDE). It found irregularities in the distribution of goods, as a result of which Mr Manuel Andrs Morales Ordosgoitti and Mr Tadeo Arriechi, director-general and legal representative of the chain, respectively, are currently the subject of an investigation procedure by the Public Prosecutor s Office, the hearing for which was deferred on the request of their private defence.(ii) As regards the directors of the Corporacin Crnica company, the Government reports that, on  January , SUNDDE officials visited the establishment following complaints that it was selling goods at excessive prices. Irregularities were established during the inspection, leading to the seizure of more than  tonnes of hoarded meat products. As a result of this situation, the Government indicates that Ms Tania Carolina Salinas, Ms Delia Isabel Ribas, Ms Anllerlin Guadalupe Lpez Graterol, Mr Ernesto Luis Arenas Pulgar and Mr Yolman Javier Valderrama Santiago are currently being investigated by the Public Prosecutor s Office.(iii) As regards the case of the FARMATODO pharmacy chain, the Government indicates that even though irregular situations affecting users had been detected, a hearing was held in the competent court for the review of the precautionary measure against Mr Pedro Luis Angarita and Mr Agustn lvarez, who are managers of the pharmacy network, in which the Public Prosecutor s Office issued a decree for their unconditional release. The Government therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this allegation.(iv) The Government indicates that there is no record of investigations against the president of the National Association of Supermarkets and Self-Service Stores (ANSA), Mr Luis Rodrguez, whose freedom is unrestricted. The Government therefore requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of this allegation. It adds that, on  February , an interview was held at SEBIN headquarters, after Mr Rodriguez had expressed his wish to provide information on the  Da a Da Practimercados' case.\n.As regards recommendation (a) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, its leaders and affiliated companies), the Committee notes with deep regret that the Government is again using its reply to accuse the complainant organization and that it gives no indication that it has taken any measures to prevent acts and statements of stigmatization and intimidation, as the Committee had recommended. The Committee is therefore bound to reiterate its previous recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. A climate of violence, coercion and threats of any type aimed at trade union leaders and their families does not encourage the free exercise and full enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in Conventions Nos  and . All States have the undeniable duty to promote and defend a social climate where respect of the law reigns as the only way of guaranteeing respect for and protection of life [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].\n.As regards recommendation (b) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of violence and threats against FEDECAMARAS and its member employers, specifically the abduction and mistreatment of FEDECAMARAS leaders Mr Noel lvarez, Mr Luis Villegas, Mr Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz in ), the Committee notes that one of the accused, Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega, was sentenced to  years and eight months' imprisonment for the crimes of brief abduction, aggravated theft of a motor vehicle, criminal conspiracy and attempted homicide in the context of aggravated robbery against the victims. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that it has been demonstrated that it was a criminal act which was not committed against the victims because they were FEDECAMARAS leaders. The Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the aforementioned ruling and to continue providing additional information concerning any penalties imposed on the perpetrators of these crimes and any compensation to FEDECAMARAS and to the leaders concerned for damage caused by those illegal acts. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the points raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters on  February . In this regard, the Committee recalls that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed; that a climate of violence, such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders, or one in which the premises and property of workers and employers are attacked, constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities; that the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events; and that the inviolability of trade union premises is a civil liberty which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights [see Digest, op. cit., paras , ,  and ].\n.As regards recommendation (c) from its previous examination of the case (allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders), observing that the Government reiterates previously submitted information and deeply regretting the absence of any indication of progress, the Committee reiterates its recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. In this regard, the Committee recalls that the confiscation of trade union property by the authorities, without a court order, constitutes an infringement of the right of trade unions to own property and undue interference in trade union activities [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.As regards recommendation (d) from its previous examination of the case (bipartite and tripartite social dialogue), the Government reiterates the information already provided on previous occasions concerning the broad, inclusive, participatory and proactive social dialogue that exists in the country, referring to certain recent initiatives in this regard. The Committee takes due note of the communication sent to the president of FEDECAMARAS and welcomes the provision that it makes to give FEDECAMARAS a larger role in the discussion with a view to developing labour policies and labour-related legislation and regulations, requesting in particular the submission of proposals for the development of wage policies and the new LOTTT regulations. However, the Committee observes that the Government does not provide any indications concerning the implementation of the plan of action recommended by the Governing Body. Regretting the lack of information and progress in this regard, the Committee reiterates its recommendation and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay.\n.As regards recommendation (e) from its previous examination of the case (actions to create a climate of trust, including the appointment of"", ""the presence of the ILO, to foster social dialogue for the resolution of all pending issues, including matters relating to the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders), the Committee reiterates its recommendation and insists on the urgency of the Government taking the requested measures without delay.\n.As regards recommendation (e) from its previous examination of the case (action to create a climate of trust and, in particular, the appointment of a representative of FEDECAMARAS to the Higher Labour Council or the tripartite social dialogue body fulfilling its functions), the Committee regrets that the Government has made no observations in this regard. In line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee again urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee urges the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard.\n.As regards recommendations (f) and (g) from its previous examination of the case (detention of employers or leaders), in the case concerning the supermarket chain, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements indicating that irregularities in the distribution of goods were found and that the chain s General Director and legal representative, respectively, were investigated but are now at liberty. In the case concerning the directors of the meat processing company, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that Ms Tania Carolina Salinas, Ms Delia Isabel Ribas, Ms Anllerlin Guadalupe Lpez Graterol, Mr Ernesto Luis Arenas Pulgar and Mr Yolman Javier Valderrama Santiago are currently being investigated by the Public Prosecutor s Office. Deeply deploring that the requested additional information on the allegations against each of the seven people under investigation has not been provided, the Committee urges the Government not merely to give an indication of general criminal offences, but to indicate the specific allegations against each of the people under investigation or trial by the judicial authorities and to provide precise information on the progress of the respective judicial proceedings. Also in the case of the meat processing company, regretting that the Government has simply reiterated the statements made in its previous communication, the Committee urges it to state whether these employers and leaders have been subjected to precautionary or detention measures and again requests the authorities to consider lifting any preventive detention measures imposed on them. In the case of the pharmacy chain, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the chain s managers, Mr Pedro Luis Angarita and Mr Agustn lvarez, are at liberty and have not been charged. With regard to the alleged detention of the former Chairperson of CONINDUSTRIA, Mr Eduardo Garmendia, the Chairperson of ANSA, Mr Luis Rodrguez, and the Chairperson of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals, Mr Rosales Briceo, the Committee takes note of the fact that the Government reiterates that they have not been detained or investigated but were merely interviewed at SEBIN headquarters and that all of them are at liberty. The Committee underlines that the high number of employers and employers' organizations' leaders who were convened at SEBIN does not help creating a climate of trust free of pressure and threats.\n.As regards recommendation (h) from its previous examination of the case (adoption by the President of the Republic of a large number of decree-laws on important economic and production-related issues without consulting FEDECAMARAS), the Committee notes with regret that the Government merely repeats information that it has already provided on the constitutional legal basis empowering the President of the Republic to issue decrees with the force of law, without making any observation concerning their relevance for or impact on social dialogue. The Committee is bound to point out once again that, over the years, when examining various complaints relating to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it has noted the use in many cases of enabling legislation by the Legislative Assembly empowering the President of the Republic to adopt many decrees and laws that affect the interests of workers' and employers' organizations without a parliamentary debate being held [see, in particular, Case No. , th Report, para. ]. The Committee emphasizes that it is important that consultations take place in good faith, confidence and mutual respect, and that the parties have sufficient time to express their views and discuss them in full with a view to reaching a suitable compromise. The Government must also ensure that it attaches the necessary importance to agreements reached between workers' and employers' organizations [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee has also emphasized the value of consulting organizations of employers and workers during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests and has drawn the attention of governments to the importance of prior consultation of employers' and workers' organizations before the adoption of any legislation in the field of labour law [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ]. Deeply deploring the persistent nature of this situation, the Committee firmly urges that full consultations on draft legislation covering labour, economic or social matters that affect their interests and those of their members be held without delay with the most representative organizations of workers and employers, including FEDECAMARAS.\n.The Committee notes with great concern the new allegations made by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS on  July  and  May  to the effect that: (i) the Government has failed to honour the undertaking to establish dialogue round tables that it made before the Governing Body of the ILO, and the highest-level state bodies have refused to enter into dialogue with FEDECAMARAS; (ii) further acts of intimidation have been directed against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and their leaders by public figures and officials, including the President of the Republic, and the public has been called upon to mobilize against FEDECAMARAS; (iii) government authorities have launched attacks on the business sector and have attacked and detained leaders, employees and shareholders, accusing them of corruption or economic destabilization and subjecting them to public ridicule without guaranteeing due process or their right of defence; (iv) FEDECAMARAS has not been made a member of the National Council on the Productive Economy and has been excluded through new government measures that have an impact on business performance and undermine freedom of association, such as the approval, without consultation, of the purchase from farmers of  per cent of agro-industrial production for use by local supply and production committees and the creation of workers' production boards and other bodies through which the Government is interfering with relations between workers and employers; and (v) additional increases in the minimum wage and the cestaticket (food voucher) have been approved without tripartite consultation and two more states of economic emergency that suspended the constitutional guarantees on economic matters have been declared through instruments that contain intimidating claims that the country s economic agents have taken a hostile, destabilizing attitude, including by hindering access to essential public goods and services. On the other hand, the Committee observes that, in its communication dated  May , the Government provides its observations replying to the allegations of the complainant organizations of  May , affirming, in particular that: (i) it had responded to the allegations of intimidating attacks against FEDECAMARAS, its affiliated organizations and its leaders, before the Governing Body during its th Session (March ); (ii) the various measures that allegedly constituted attacks to various business sectors were not arbitrary and were carried out in accordance with the law and with the goal of protecting the population; (iii) the purchase of  per cent of agro-industrial production was carried out in accordance with its mandate to ensure the availability of commodities within the context of economic warfare and the creation of workers' production boards was carried out to promote the participation of the working class in the management of production, without replacing or opposing the trade union organization; (iii) the increase of the cestaticket (food voucher) was the result of its natural annual adjustment and, with respect to the salary increase of May , the opinion of FEDECAMARAS had been requested and no concrete response had been received. The Committee will examine these allegations and the reply at its next meeting, and requests the Government to communicate any additional relevant observations in this respect.\n.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)\tWhile once again expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, the Committee insists on the urgency of the Government taking strong measures to prevent such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Committee strongly urges the"", ""arrest has been alleged, despite the Committee having deemed the case to be extremely serious and having therefore drawn the Governing Body s special attention to it. The Committee expresses its concern, noting that it is alleged that some detainees might be condemned to '  years of imprisonment.\n.Since the Government s most recent reply limits itself to confirming its previous statements concerning the allegations of detention of business persons and employers' leaders, the occupation of business premises and the seizure of goods, the Committee emphasizes the importance of having the supplementary information requested, given the contradiction between the allegations and the Government s response as to whether or not it has complied with the rules of due process, whether or not economic offences have been committed, whether or not there has been an attack on employers and their officials and, whether or not there are ulterior motives which have nothing to do with defending the interests of employers' organizations and their members. The Committee stresses in particular the important need for the Government to indicate the specific allegations against each of the employers or leaders mentioned in the complaint, and not to limit itself to an indication of the general criminal offences (boycott, hoarding, smuggling, speculation, etc.). The Committee urges the Government to provide this information together with information on developments in the respective criminal proceedings. The Committee also requests the Government to forward its observations regarding the latest additional information on these questions that the IOE and FEDECAMARAS have transmitted in their communication dated  May . The Committee calls on the authorities to consider lifting the precautionary custodial measures imposed on employers and business leaders pending trial.\n.With regard to the recommendation (b), the Committee observes with concern from the Government s statements that the criminal proceedings in question have not yet been completed. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations.\n.With regard to recommendations (a) and (c)' f), that it issued in relation to other aspects of the case, the Committee expresses its deep concern, observing the lack of information and lack of any progress; reiterates its previous conclusions and recommendations and urges the Government to take the requested measures without delay. More particularly, the Committee expresses its deep concern, observing that in their allegations of  May , the IOE and FEDECAMARAS indicated new acts of intimidation and stigmatization against the latter and its leaders by the authorities, including in April .\n.In general, the Committee expresses its grave concern at the specific situation regarding the rights of freedom of association of FEDECAMARAS, its leaders and its members.\n.In the view of the above interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While expressing its deep concern at the various and serious forms of stigmatization and intimidation by the Bolivarian authorities, groups and organizations directed against FEDECAMARAS, its member organizations, their leaders and affiliated companies, including threats of imprisonment, statements of incitement to hatred, accusations of carrying out an economic war, the occupation and looting of stores, the seizure of FEDECAMARAS headquarters, etc., the Committee wishes to point out to the Government the importance of strong measures to avoid such actions and statements against individuals and organizations that are legitimately defending their interests under Conventions Nos  and , ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.(b) The Committee notes with regret that the criminal proceedings relating to the bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February  and the abduction and maltreatment in  of the leaders of that organization, Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Albis Muoz (the last-mentioned sustaining three bullet wounds) have not yet been completed, again expresses the firm hope that they will be concluded without further delay, and requests the Government to keep it informed. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and that FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned are compensated for the damage caused by these illegal acts. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the issues raised by FEDECAMARAS with regard to the bomb attack on its headquarters.(c) As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee requests that those current or former leaders of FEDECAMARAS be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee refers to the decision of the Governing Body in March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  and regrets that the Government stated in its last communication that establishing a dialogue round table on questions of recovery of estates and holding consultations on legislation are not viable. The Committee urges the Government to implement this request along the lines described in the conclusions and to report thereon. Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasizes  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' (d) As regards the structured bodies for bipartite and tripartite social dialogue which need to be established in the country, and the plan of action in consultation with the social partners, involving the establishment of stages and specific time frames for its implementation with the technical assistance of the ILO, as recommended by the Governing Body, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it has not yet concluded the process of consultation with different sectors and organizations and requests the Government to ensure that FEDECAMARAS is included in all these processes. The Committee recalls that the conclusions of the mission refer to a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, and a tripartite dialogue round table, with the participation of the ILO and an independent chair. The Committee urges the Government to immediately adopt tangible measures with regard to bipartite and tripartite social dialogue as requested by the high-level tripartite mission. Noting that the Government has not yet provided the requested plan of action, the Committee urges the Government to implement without delay the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission endorsed by the Governing Body and to report thereon. The Committee urges the Government to promote social dialogue and initiatives taken in this area, such as the meeting held between the authorities and FEDECAMARAS in February , and immediately to implement tripartite consultations.(e) The Committee, in line with the conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission, urges the Government to take immediate action to create a climate of trust based on respect for employers' and trade union organizations with a view to promoting solid and stable industrial relations. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any measures taken in this regard. The Committee further requests the Government, as a first step in the right direction that should not pose any problem, to enable a representative of FEDECAMARAS to be appointed to the Higher Labour Council.(f) The Committee notes with concern the allegations by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS of  November  concerning: (i) the detention of Mr Eduardo Garmendia, President of CONINDUSTRIA, for  hours; (ii) the shadowing and harassment of Mr Jorge Roig, President of FEDECAMARAS; (iii) an escalation of the verbal attacks on FEDECAMARAS by high-level State officials in the media; and (iv) the adoption by the President of the Republic, in November , of  decree laws on important economic and production-related matters without consultation of FEDECAMARAS. The Committee requests the Government to send complete observations on these allegations.(g) The Committee notes with concern new allegations from the IOE and FEDECAMARAS and the observations by the Government of  and  March  on some of the allegations. The Committee once again requests the Government to complete its response, to indicate the specific allegations against each of the  employers or managers from the different sectors who have been detained or placed under precautionary measures by the judicial authorities, and not to limit itself to an indication of the general criminal offences (boycott, hoarding, smuggling, speculation, etc.), and also to provide information on developments in the respective judicial proceedings. The Committee also requests the Government to forward its observations concerning the latest additional information transmitted by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS in their communication dated  May . The Committee intends to examine these serious issues in a""]"

The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations.\n.As regards the  bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters, in relation to which the Government has reported the death of the perpetrator, the Committee also observes that FEDECAMARAS indicated to the high-level tripartite mission that: () the person who planted the bomb (a police inspector, Mr Hctor Serrano) died as a result of the explosion; () on  February , a complaint was filed with the Public Prosecutor s Office; () on  August , the Public Prosecutor s Office issued a ruling ordering the case to be closed for lack of sufficient evidence to establish a guilty party, which was appealed by FEDECAMARAS; () on  May , the Forensic, Penal and Criminal Investigations Unit (CICPC) announced the detention of a public official, police officer, Mr Crisstomo Montoya, for an act of terrorism in planting the explosive device (it is reported that he has been released) and that Ms Ivonne Mrquez was also implicated;() the th Court of First Instance scheduled the public hearing of the oral trial for  November , which was deferred to  October ; and () to date no one has been found guilty of the attack. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.\n.Generally speaking, with regard to the allegations of physical and verbal violence against employers' leaders and their organizations, the Committee once more stresses that the absence of judgments against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], and that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee reiterates the importance of ensuring that the perpetrators receive sentences that are in proportion to the seriousness of their crimes, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the latter, and of compensating FEDECAMARAS and the leaders concerned for the damage caused by those illegal acts [see nd Report, para. ].\n.As regards the allegations of the seizure of farms, land recoveries, occupations and expropriations to the detriment of current or former employers' leaders, the Committee previously requested that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia be compensated in a just manner. At the same time, the Committee referred to the Governing Body s decision of March , in which it  urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to develop and implement the Plan of Action as recommended by the high-level tripartite mission, in consultation with national social partners'  which involved, as mentioned by the mission,  the establishment of a round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS, with the presence of the ILO, to deal with all pending matters relating to the recovery of estates and the expropriation of enterprises (including the new information communicated to the mission) and other related problems arising or that may arise in the future'  The Committee urged the Government to implement this request and to report thereon. Furthermore, the Committee, as did the mission, noted with concern the information provided about new acts of recovery, occupation and expropriation of the property of an employers' leader of FEDECAMARAS (Mr Vicente Brito). Finally, like the high-level tripartite mission, the Committee emphasized  the importance of taking every measure to avoid any kind of discretion or discrimination in the legal mechanisms governing the expropriation or recovery of land or other mechanisms that affect the right to own property' \n.The Committee notes the Government s statement, with regard to the alleged seizure of farms belonging to employers' leaders Mr Eduardo Gmez Sgala and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, that the Ministry of Agriculture and Land and INTI have reported that, in the case of those leaders, the legal procedure for land recovery was followed since they failed to demonstrate their ownership of the land and that this did not therefore constitute expropriation; and that, in the case of Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia, the land that he occupied has been recovered. He demonstrated his ownership of part of that land, of which he is still in possession, and the remainder, the ownership of which he was unable to demonstrate, has been recovered. In the other two cases, concerning Mr Egildo Lujn and Mr Vicente Brito, INTI has reported that its archives contain no information on any recoveries or expropriations under their names. The Committee notes the Government s statement that it has been demonstrated that the application of the Land and Agrarian Development Act and the implementation of procedures by the state agencies in the matter did not give rise to acts of anti-union discrimination or harassment and that the application of land policy was not based on discretionary action by the State; the procedures and mechanisms for the recovery and expropriation of land are determined by national law and implemented by the competent bodies. The Committee notes that the Government considers that a country s land and agrarian development policies are not matters for examination by the Committee on Freedom of Association and that it requests the Committee not to pursue its examination of these cases since they do not entail violations of freedom of association, let alone acts of anti-union persecution.\n.The Committee observed during previous examinations of the case that the complainant organizations maintained that the expropriations and recoveries were linked to the status of the employers' leaders in question and that they were discriminatory.\n.The Committee notes with regret that, with regard to the allegations that land belonging to employers' leaders was expropriated, the Government gives legal reasons for not allowing FEDECAMARAS to participate in a round table on land recovery owing to a procedure established in the Land and Agrarian Development Act. In particular, the Committee notes the Government s statement, concerning a dialogue round table that will address  other existing problems that may arise in the future in this area' (recovery of estates), that this proposal is not viable since it is not possible to establish a dialogue round table to address issues that could possibly arise in an uncertain future and that section  of the Land and Agrarian Development Act establishes a clear procedure which cannot be negotiated between two parties. The Government indicates that the trade union organizations of rural workers (whose names are not specified) showed a total lack of interest in participating in a round table and adds that it is not up to a tripartite round table to hold consultations on legislation. The Committee recalls that its examination of cases of expropriation or recovery of land belonging to employers' leaders has been conducted solely from the point of view of potential discrimination owing to their status as leaders. The Committee stresses that the purpose of the round table between the Government and FEDECAMARAS would be for the two parties to examine and evaluate the functioning of the existing system and the usefulness of potential legislative amendments and to examine the application of procedures in respect of these leaders. The Committee therefore reiterates its previous recommendations, including those concerning fair compensation for the current or former leaders of FEDECAMERAS in question.\n.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee noted with regret from the report of the high-level tripartite mission that the Tripartite Commission on minimum wages, which had existed under the previous labour legislation, had been abolished under the new legislation (the Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT)). It also took note of the allegations made by the IOE and FEDECAMARAS, in which they stated that the Government, again ignoring the Committee s recommendations, had continued to issue regulations with a significant impact on both private Venezuelan companies and their workers without proper tripartite consultation and social dialogue, in particular without including FEDECAMARAS as the most representative employers' organization in the country. The Committee further noted that there had been no consultation on People s Ministry of Labour and Social Security Decision No.  of  April , which regulates the National Register of Workers' Organizations but also applies to employers' organizations; the partial regulation on working time relating to the Decree with the rank, power and force of the Basic Act on Labour and Workers, published on  April ; and the previous failure to consult FEDECAMARAS with regard to the aforementioned Basic Act and many other pieces of legislation.\n.The Committee notes the Government s statements reiterating that the country has broad and inclusive participatory dialogue during the drafting of legislation and that consultation of the people is a daily occurrence. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that FEDECAMARAS has repeatedly been called on to participate in the national dialogue"", ""Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)\tRegarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)\tRegarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)\tObserving the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)\tRegarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle. Be that as it may, the Committee observes that the Government does not deny the IOE s allegation that the farm is currently a military training centre (as opposed to the Government s statement that the purpose of the land rescue procedure is to encourage the agricultural use of the Valle del Ro) or the allegation that Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala has not received any compensation. The Committee therefore once again calls on the Government to respond fully to the allegations, return the farm property without delay to the employers' leader and compensate him fully for all losses sustained as a result of the intervention by the authorities in seizing his farm.(g)\tThe Committee requests the complainant organizations to send their comments on the information and observations presented by the Government concerning the expropriation of Agroislea SA, Owen Illinois and the Turbio steel plant.(h)\tThe Committee invites the complainants to provide their observations on the Government statement on the livestock farmer Mr Franklin Brito.(i)\tRegarding the alleged confiscation ( rescue'  according to the Government) of the farms owned by the employers' leaders, Mr Egildo Lujn, Mr Vicente Brito, Mr Rafael Marcial Garmendia and Mr Manuel Cipriano Heredia, the Committee considers that it is impossible to discount the possibility of discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that they are granted fair compensation without delay and to initiate a frank dialogue with those affected and with FEDECAMARAS on the confiscations/rescues referred to and to keep it informed of developments. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the attacks on the buildings owned by Mr Carlos Sequera Ypez, former President of FEDECAMARAS.(j)\tRegarding the alleged lack of bipartite and tripartite social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s new allegations concerning the approval without any tripartite consultation of laws that affect the interests of employers and their organizations. The Committee regrets that the Government has not responded specifically to these allegations of the IOE and urges it to do so without delay. Moreover, observing that the serious shortcomings in social dialogue continue to exist, the Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, as follows:' deeply deploring that the Government has ignored its recommendations, the Committee urges the Government to establish a high-level joint national committee in the country with the assistance of the ILO, to examine each and every one of the allegations and issues in this case so that the problems can be solved through direct dialogue. The Committee trusts that the Government will not postpone the adoption of the necessary measures any further and urges the Government to keep it informed in this regard;' the Committee expects that a forum for social dialogue will be established in accordance with the principles of the ILO, having a tripartite composition which duly respects the representativeness of workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and invites it to request technical assistance from the ILO. The Committee also requests it once again to convene the tripartite commission on minimum wages provided for in the Organic Labour Act;' observing that there are still no structured bodies for tripartite social dialogue, the Committee emphasizes once more the importance that should be attached to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights and that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by detailed consultations with the most representative independent workers' and employers' organizations. The Committee once again requests the Government to ensure that any legislation concerning labour, social and economic issues adopted in the context of the Enabling Act be first subject to genuine, in-depth consultations with the most representative independent employers' and workers' organizations, while endeavouring to find shared solutions wherever possible;' the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to social dialogue and any bipartite or tripartite consultations in sectors other than food and agriculture, and also with regard to social dialogue with FEDECAMARAS and its regional structures in connection with the various sectors of activity, the formulation of economic and social policy and the drafting of laws which affect the interests of the employers and their organizations;' the Committee requests the Government to ensure that as part of its policy of inclusive dialogue (including within the Legislative Assembly), FEDECAMARAS is duly consulted in the course of any legislative debate that may affect employer interests, in a manner commensurate with its level of representativeness.The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has once again ignored these recommendation despite the fact that the Committee has been insisting on them for years.(k)\tRegarding the alleged discrimination by the authorities against FEDECAMARAS and the allegations of favouritism vis--vis parallel organizations close to the Government and lacking in independence, the Committee reiterates the conclusions, recommendations and principles contained in its previous examination of the case and requests the Government to reply in detail to the allegations concerning the financing of parallel organizations and of favouritism vis--vis EMPREVEN and the  social production companies' and the discrimination against private companies. Regarding the IOE s new allegations concerning the sending of electronic mails between senior officials and parallel employers' organizations, the Committee calls on the Government to verify without delay with the senior officials concerned whether or not they or their representatives sent the electronic mail attached to the IOE s deposition.(l)\tRegarding the Defence of Political Sovereignty and National Self-Determination Bill, the Committee calls on the Government to ensure respect for the abovementioned principle as regards international financial assistance to workers' and employers' organizations so that, if the Bill does indeed apply to them, to take the necessary measures without delay to amend the Bill (or the Act) so as to guarantee explicitly the rights of employers' and workers' organizations to receive international financial assistance without prior authorization from the authorities for activities related to the promotion and defence of the interests of their members.(m)\tRegarding the complainant organization s comments on the Central Planning Commission Act, the Committee had observed in its earlier examination of the case that the legislation establishes strong state intervention in the economy and national economic structure under the aegis of central planning in order to construct the Venezuelan socialist model and had requested the complainant organizations to provide information on the relationship between the allegations and the violation of Conventions Nos  and . The Committee reiterates this recommendation and indicates that if the organizations have not done"", ""Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its previous examination of the case in March , the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters still pending [see rd Report, para. ]:(a)\tRegarding the abduction and maltreatment of the FEDECAMARAS leaders, Messrs Noel lvarez, Luis Villegas, Ernesto Villamil and Ms Albis Muoz (Employer member of the Governing Body of the ILO), the latter being wounded by three bullets, the Committee deplores the offences that were committed, emphasizes their seriousness and requests the Government to take all the steps within its power to arrest the other three persons involved in the abductions and wounding, and to keep it informed of developments in the investigations. The Committee notes the Government s statement that a public hearing was scheduled for  October  and expresses the hope that the persons guilty of these crimes will soon be convicted and sentenced in proportion to the seriousness of the offences in order that such incidents will not be repeated and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. At the same time, the Committee notes with concern the IOE s statement in its additional information that Ms Albis Muoz, employers' leader and one of the victims of aggression, has asserted that neither of the suspects arrested (Mr Antonio Jos Silva Moyega and Mr Jason Manjares) were the instigators of the aggression, as well as the IOE s reservations as to the idea that the motive of the aggression was car theft.(b)\tRegarding the criminal investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor s Office into the public declarations by the President of FEDECAMARAS, Mr Noel lvarez, the Committee wishes to state that, in the context described by the IOE, the declarations do not in its opinion appear to contain any criminal content and should not normally have given rise to a criminal investigation. However, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation.(c)\tRegarding the alleged attacks on FEDECAMARAS headquarters in , the Committee had requested FEDECAMARAS to file an official complaint on the subject with the Public Prosecutor s Office. The Committee reiterates that recommendation and indicates that if the organization has not done so by the Committee s next meeting, it will not pursue its examination of this allegation any further; noting however that an environment of harassment and lack of confidence in the public authorities is not conducive to the proposed lodging of its official complaints.(d)\tRegarding the alleged bomb attack on FEDECAMARAS headquarters on  February , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the persons charged, Mr Juan Crisstomo Montoya Gonzlez and Mrs Ivonne Gioconda Mrquez Burgos, have confessed in full to the crimes of public intimidation and unlawful use of identity papers, that a preliminary public hearing was set for  November  and that, as soon as a final ruling on the case was handed down, the Committee would be duly informed. The Committee emphasizes the importance that the guilty parties should be punished in proportion to the seriousness of the crimes committed and the employer organization compensated for the loss and damage on account of these illegal acts. The Committee is waiting to be informed of the sentence handed down.(e)\tObserving the various acts of violence committed against FEDECAMARAS or its officials, the Committee again draws the attention of the Government to the fundamental principle that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can be exercised only in a climate free of violence, intimidation and fear, as such situations of insecurity are incompatible with the requirements of Convention No. .(f)\tRegarding the Committee s recommendation that the Government restore the La Bureche farm to the employers' leader, Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala, and compensate him fully for all the damage caused by the authorities in occupying the farm, the Committee notes that there is a contradiction between the allegations and the Government s judgment that the expropriated farm of employers' leader Mr Eduardo Gmez Sigala was idle.

In view of the lengthy delay in the bargaining process, the Committee expects that the collective agreement will be signed as soon as possible and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.With regard to the allegations concerning the (temporary) detention and criminal prosecution of the SUTRA-CVG union leaders Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee had urged the Government, in its previous examination of the case, to urge the judicial authority to give due consideration to the fact that the trade unionists in question were staging a peaceful protest calling for the enforcement of the collective agreement and requested the Government to inform it of the judgment handed down in relation to those trade unionists. The Committee notes that the Government states that the Office of the Public Prosecutor filed charges against those individuals as a result of the events that occurred on  October , on the premises of the preschool establishment of the CVG and that, at the preliminary hearing, a precautionary measure was ordered consisting in prohibiting the disruption or hindrance of work at the enterprise; the trial is now under way, according to the Government, and the oral hearing is scheduled for  March . The Committee reiterates its previous conclusions and requests the Government to inform it of the judgment handed down by the judicial authority.\n.With regard to the allegations concerning the criminal prosecution of the SUTISS-Bolvar trade union leaders Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez, and the criminal prosecution in  of the employees of the enterprise Camila CA, Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez, the Committee takes note of the statements by the Government, according to which: () on  September , the Office of the Public Prosecutor received a complaint from the representatives of the enterprise alleging that, on  August , the individuals in question violently and without the authorization or consent of any representative of the enterprise forcefully took possession of six machines and refused to return them, paralysing the industrial activities being carried out in various parts of the enterprise; () on  July , the Office of the Public Prosecutor charged the abovementioned individuals with aggravated misappropriation, restriction of freedom to work and taking the law into their own hands, as provided in the Venezuelan Penal Code; at the preliminary hearing, held on  September , the charges were admitted and a precautionary measure applied consisting of the requirement to report periodically to the court; the persons concerned are thus free, and the order was issued for the case to go to trial. The public oral hearing was scheduled and deferred on several occasions owing to failure of the accused parties to appear; and () the Office of the Public Prosecutor reported that on  January , the accused individuals presented themselves at the trial court and a date is to be fixed by the judicial authority for the oral hearing.\n.The Committee urgently requests the Government to communicate the judgment handed down in regard to these trade union leaders and workers and, in view of the fact that the events in question date back to  and that these trade unionists are required to report periodically to the court, expects that the judgment will be handed down in the near future. In this regard, the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied.\n.With regard to the allegation that, on  March , the national guard and the Bolvar State Police brutally repressed a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium-Sidor who were calling for improvements to the collective agreement that was being negotiated, resulting in several wounded, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers, the Committee, having noted in its previous examination of the case that, according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking traffic with cars and burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers, requested the Government to supply a copy of the judgment that is handed down, noted the delay in the judicial proceedings and requested the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations concerning the excessive use of public force which resulted in serious injuries and property damage. The Committee notes the Government s reply to the effect that: () it reiterates that the these acts occurred when a group of individuals were obstructing vehicle traffic with cars and burning tyres, throwing heavy objects at the members of the national guard, injuring several officers (Ral Mora, Alexander Marin Bucarelo, Pastran Comentes); () according to the Government, the demonstrators threw stones, bottles and iron briquettes, resulting in action by the national guard and the state police, and the detention of several persons for these acts of violence and the alleged obstruction and closure of thoroughfares; the court ordered the initiation of ordinary proceedings without imposing any custodial measures. The Committee reiterates its conclusions in the previous examination of the case.\n.With regard to the allegation concerning the detention since September  and criminal prosecution of union leader Rubn Gonzlez, for protesting against the failure by the enterprise CGV Ferrominera Orinoco CA (Puerto Ordaz) to honour the commitments set out in the collective agreement, the Committee considered in its previous examination of the case, that the events, as alleged by the Government, do not justify his preliminary detention or house arrest since September  and requested that he be released without delay pending judgment and appropriately compensated for the damages suffered. The Committee notes that the Government reiterates that on  September , the Office of the Public Prosecutor charged that individual with public order offences such as incitement to commit an offence, illegal assembly, restriction of freedom to work, and breach of the special security zone arrangements, and that the court received the charges and ordered the house arrest of the accused. The Committee notes that the Government states that, as regards the precautionary measure (house arrest) imposed on  January , the competent court issued a finding of non-compliance, and therefore revoked it, setting  March  as the date of the preliminary hearing, which the defence counsel for the accused failed to attend. The hearing was subsequently held in the court of preliminary proceedings (Tribunal de Control), which admitted the charges brought by the Office of the Public Prosecutor against Mr Rubn Gonzlez, and consequently the case is currently under trial. The Committee notes that the Government concludes by stating that the trial began on  November ; on  February , hearing No.  was held in the competent criminal court; the closing session of the trial is scheduled for Monday  February, when a ruling may be handed down by the judge in this case, and that the trial is thus in full progress.\n.The Committee takes note of the new allegations of the complainant organization to the effect that on  February , trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez was sentenced by a criminal court judge to a prison term of seven years, six months and  days, although he was unexpectedly released on parole three days after being sentenced, the judgment having been overturned by decision of the criminal division of the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds that it was unfounded; the trade union leader is thus awaiting a new judgment, which will be handed down by a criminal court judge  kilometres from his place of residence (the complainant organization points out that he was deprived of freedom for  months).\n.The Committee regrets the delay in the criminal proceedings relating to the trade union leader Rubn Gonzlez and the lack of adequate grounds for the judgment handed down by the judge in the case, and requests the Government to inform it of the new criminal judgment to be handed down. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation, considering that the events, as alleged by the Government, do not justify his preliminary detention or house arrest since September , and requests that he be appropriately compensated for the damages suffered.\n.In', ""acting through its representatives, ignores or selectively recognizes the benefits set forth in the '  collective agreement of which clause  requires INCES to pay  travel allowances to its workers when they are required, in the course of their professional or trade union activities, to travel away from their workplaces'  in practice, INCES does not fully recognize this right when it rejects applications by SINTRAINCES to organize its assemblies and board meetings, or only partially complies on an exceptional basis. INCES also promotes and funds a parallel trade union called SINTRASEP INCES, which was founded later than the complainant trade union in December , and whose executive board is not elected but appointed by the employer party. INCES agreed to allocate resources to cover transfers and travel allowances for members of the parallel trade union. Furthermore, this trade union is, with the permission of the employer party, organizing campaigns to disqualify SINTRAINCES and its members and officials. The campaigns were stepped up in October and November  when libellous and slanderous messages were disseminated in all INCES branches nationwide.\n.In this context, INCES is denying SINTRAINCES the spaces that have historically been used by workers and trade unions to organize meetings, workshops, assemblies and the like. Instead, it has worked with SINTRASEP INCES to provide covered facilities with seating for registering new members. INCES representatives have taken various measures to interfere with trade union activities, such as the following:' INCES managers have threatened and punished workers who attended SINTRAINCES meetings, and have therefore impeded the workers' right of assembly and their right to participate. Similarly, it has restricted and prevented travel by regional officials of the trade union, in violation of the clauses in the existing collective agreement that specify the employer party s financial contribution (travel allowance) to the cost of travel and assistance for regional officials attending national meetings;' INCES has banned the use of the meeting facilities (auditoriums, meeting rooms) that always used to be made available to the trade union for the purpose of holding meetings with workers, and even locked members out or forcibly expelled them from workplaces. On  June  in Gurico State, for example, a group led by the regional manager of INCES and various bosses travelling with him forced the national executive board of SINTRAINCES to move out of the INCES Gurico Socialist Training Centre that they had been visiting on that day for the purpose of hearing complaints from workers in the region. After an angry exchange, the trade union officials agreed to leave the Centre in order to avoid a violent turn of events. The trade union also submitted a written application on  May  (i.e. far enough in advance) for the use of the auditorium facilities at INCES headquarters in Caracas for the purpose of holding an assembly of workers on  June , and the application was granted. However, when the day of the assembly came, the workers were prevented from entering the auditorium and in response they held a peaceful demonstration that attracted media coverage. SINTRAINCES subsequently announced that a new assembly would be held on  June  away from INCES premises (in Generalsimo Francisco de Miranda park in Caracas) because of the refusal to allow the use of the Institute s facilities. As confirmed by communications from the human resources management department, the workers were told to refrain from attending or face sanctions. The workers were again invited to assemblies in each of the regional INCES branches on  October at  a.m., and the workers were again informed in writing that they were not permitted to attend.\n.INCES has taken a number of measures of reprisal, including the following, against trade union members:' It initiated dismissal proceedings against SINTRAINCES officials (Mr David Duarte of Trujillo State, and Mr Job Alexander Meza of Tchira State) after they complained to the media and organized peaceful demonstrations in defence of labour rights; the proceedings are now at the decision stage in the Ministry of Labour;' it dismissed workers, including some who were entitled to immunity from dismissal (Ms Yesenia Cordero and Ms Desire Mendoza), on the grounds that they had attended SINTRAINCES meetings and supported the trade union (they were subsequently reinstated after their appeals were upheld);' SINTRAINCES officials from Tchira State (Mr Job Alexander Meza and Mr Wolfgang Crespo) were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in defence of labour rights when they were physically assaulted on  May  by a group of persons goaded on by the employer party. A complaint was lodged the same day with the Third Prosecutor s Office of the Public Prosecution Service in Tchira State (there has yet to be any practical follow-up on the complaint).\n.Not only has the executive committee of INCES treated its workers, and SINTRAINCES in particular, in a discriminatory, unfair and threatening manner, it has also neglected its obligation as the employer party to deduct union dues and remit them to the trade union, as required by clause  of the existing collective agreement, in compliance with section  of the Labour Act, which is also in force.\n.In spite of numerous communications transmitted by SINTRAINCES to the human resources directorate for it to update membership information, the directorate has failed to do so, invoking trivial excuses in the hope of stifling the trade union. On  February , an original document containing membership information on , workers, and indicating the first name and family name, identity card number, personal index code, job title, age, region and recruitment date of each of them, was transmitted to the directorate, which has refused to honour the commitments made in the collective agreement and with which it is legally bound to comply, in this case by deducting the dues of the workers in question. In addition to the update of membership information, SINTRAINCES also took the opportunity to request a change in the trade union dues since they had never been brought into line with the sum specified in the trade union s statutes, but no such change has been forthcoming.\n.According to the complainant, the employer party has ordered regional managers to coerce workers into leaving SINTRAINCES and joining the parallel trade union by threatening them with sanctions and political blackmail or non-renewal of their contracts (in the case of workers with contracts). Many workers have been frightened and blackmailed into joining the parallel organization.\n.INCES also intends to ignore SINTRAINCES as a legitimate representative of INCES workers in order to avoid discussing the collective labour agreement with representatives of that union. Instead, with a view to preventing discussion, the parallel trade union submitted a draft collective agreement after SINTRAINCES had submitted its own draft.\n.According to the complainant, SINTRAINCES submitted the draft collective labour agreement for '  to the Ministry of People s Power for Labour and Social Security (MINPPTRASS) on  November  but it has so far proved impossible to initiate bargaining because of a clear failure by the Institute to comply with its obligation to negotiate, even though the trade union has faithfully adhered to the public sector collective bargaining procedure.\n.As a result of the situations described above, that is, the labour breaches and violations, SINTRAINCES decided on  September  to initiate the established legal procedure for organizing a workers' strike by submitting to MINPPTRASS a document known as a  list of grievances'  However, both INCES and the Ministry of Labour have hindered the process by ignoring the principles set forth in the Constitution, the deadlines specified in labour legislation and international conventions.\n.Furthermore, the complainant alleges that there has been an at least partial failure to comply with  clauses of the collective labour agreement for ' , which remains in force. The clauses in question are as follows:  (mutual respect);  (replacements);  (performance evaluation);  (industrial safety and health);  (toiletries);  (supply of milk);  (housing plan);  (individual development and training plan);  (vacation plan);  (recreational tourism and sports events);  (end-of-year party);  (recognition of merit);  (canteen services);  (sporting events);  (preparing workers for retirement);  (annual recreation and leisure plan for retirees and pensioners);  (comprehensive medical services at headquarters and in regional INCES branches);  (work involving the use of motor vehicles);  (travel allowances for trade union officials);  (overtime and additional payments);  (tax revenue staff productivity bonus);  (May Day celebration);  (work meetings); and  (trade union dues).\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government states, with regard to the complainant s allegation concerning the promotion and funding of a parallel trade union, that the provisions of article  of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stipulate that  Workers, without distinction of any kind and without need for authorization in advance, have the right freely to establish such union organizations as they may deem appropriate for the optimum protection of their rights and interests, as well as the right to join"", ""on  November , that the relevant criminal court held hearing No.  on  February , and that the proceedings were to be concluded on Monday,  February, when the judge would hand down a ruling on the matter. In other words, the trial was still in progress.\n.The Committee took note of the new allegations of  March  presented by the complainant to the effect that on  February  a judge condemned union leader Rubn Gonzlez to seven years, six months and  days in prison, and that it was therefore something of a surprise when, three days later, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice overturned the sentence on the grounds that it lacked substance and Rubn Gonzlez was released. The outcome of this development is that the union leader is now awaiting a new sentence, which this time will be handed down by a criminal judge  km from his home (the complainant stresses that he had been previously under house arrest for  months).\n.The Committee regretted the delay in the criminal proceedings brought against Rubn Gonzlez and the lack of substance motivating the sentence handed down by the judge originally handling the case and requested the Government to communicate to it the new sentence that is to be handed down. The Committee reiterated its earlier recommendation, considering that the charges against the union leader do not justify the fact that he has been in preventive detention or under house arrest ever since September , and requested that he be appropriately compensated for the damages suffered.\n.The Committee takes note that in its latest reply the Government rejects the complainant s allegations of  March  and the accusations they contain and states that it will duly inform the Committee of the outcome of the case.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice examined the case against Rubn Gonzlez that had been brought before the court of first instance and ruled that the sentence handed down by the Sixth Tribunal of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the State of Bolvar lacked sufficient grounds, a procedural error that is in violation of principles and guarantees, such as access to justice and due process, that are embodied in the Constitution and that it had therefore declared the original sentence null and void. The case was transferred to another court of justice to hold a public trial and hand down a new sentence. The same Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice likewise imposed on Rubn Daro Gonzlez Rojas a less severe interim measure than the previous one, by requiring him to present himself before the judicial authority every two weeks and prohibiting him from leaving the country. The Committee takes note of the Government s explanation that the Supreme Court of Justice has the power, at its own discretion or at the request of a party, to take over any file or case and deal with it itself or assign it to another court. Its authority to do so is laid down in article  of the Organic Act establishing the Supreme Court of Justice. In the case of Gonzlez Rojas the courts within whose jurisdiction it would normally fall were relieved of the case on the grounds that it had disturbed the tranquillity and daily life of the State of Bolvar and, in order to maintain the purpose of established criminal proceedings and to ensure that justice was applied responsibly and swiftly, the case was transferred to a different criminal circuit court in the metropolitan area of Caracas.\n.However, the Committee notes with regret that the Government has failed to explain the steps required to be taken to sanction the Attorney-General for prosecuting, in the first place, a charge of  unlawful association' which, according to the information available before the Committee in its previous examination of the case, had no substance and has, after a period of unjustified imprisonment of the trade union leader, now been set aside.\n.Once again the Committee regrets the delay in the criminal proceedings brought against Rubn Gonzlez (who is currently required under an interim measure to present himself before the judicial authority of Caracas every two weeks and prohibited from leaving the country) and would like to know why it was necessary to remove the case from the criminal court within whose jurisdiction it would normally fall. The Committee expresses its concern at the fact that the interim measure requiring Rubn Gonzlez to travel periodically to Caracas means that he has to travel long distances that disrupt the exercise of his trade union functions and should therefore be avoided.\n.The Committee requests the Government to communicate to it the new sentence to be handed down following the revoking by the Supreme Court of Justice of an earlier sentence on the grounds that it was insufficiently motivated. Finally, the Committee reiterates the recommendation it made when it examined the case previously, considering that the charges against Rubn Gonzlez do not justify the preventive detention and house arrest to which he was subjected for seven years prior to the current interim measures and once again requests the Government that he be compensated for the damages suffered.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)\tBearing in mind the considerable delay in the negotiation process, the Committee expects the collective agreement between SUNEP CVG and the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana to be signed as soon as possible and once again requests the Government to keep it informed of developments without delay.(b)\tRegarding the alleged (provisional) arrest and criminal prosecution of SUTRA CVG union officials Ronald Gonzlez and Carlos Quijada and of trade unionists Adonis Rangel Centeno, Elvis Lorn Azocar and Darwin Lpez, the Committee urges the Government once again to draw the judicial authority s attention without delay to the need for it to take duly into account the fact that the trade unionists concerned were engaged in a peaceful demonstration to demand compliance with the collective agreement, and requests the Government to communicate to it without delay the sentence that is handed down.(c)\tRegarding the alleged criminal prosecution of SUTISS Bolvar union leaders (Juan Antonio Valor, Leonel Grisett and Jhoel Jos Ruiz Hernndez) and the criminal prosecution of employees of Camila CA in  (Richard Alonso Daz, Osmel Jos Ramrez Malav, Julio Csar Soler, Agdatamir Antonio Rivas, Luis Arturo Alzota Bermdez, Argenis Godofredo Gmez and Bruno Epitafio Lpez), the Committee requests the Government to communicate to it without delay the sentence handed down on the said union leaders and employees and, bearing in mind that the incidents date back to  and that the trade unionists involved are required periodically to present themselves before the judicial authority, trusts that the sentence will be handed down very soon. The Committee recalls that a delay in the administration of justice is tantamount to a denial of justice.(d)\tRegarding the alleged brutal repression by the national guard and police of the State of Bolvar of a gathering of steelworkers from Ternium Sidor who were demanding improvements to the collective agreement under negotiation, which resulted in injuries to several people, dozens of criminal prosecutions and the destruction by the authorities of  vehicles belonging to the workers (according to the Government, a group of some  workers was blocking the traffic with private vehicles, burning tyres and throwing heavy objects at members of the national guard unit, injuring several officers), the Committee takes note that the judicial authority ordered the unconditional release of the workers who had been charged and again requests the Government to conduct an inquiry without delay into the allegations that the police used excessive force and caused serious injuries and damage to property.(e)\tThe Committee regrets once again the delay in the criminal proceedings brought against the trade union leader Mr Ruben Gonzlez (which have resulted in repeated restrictions of his free movement) and requests the Government to provide it with a copy of the judgment that is handed down after the initial sentence was declared null and void by the Supreme Court of Justice because it lacked sufficient grounds. Finally, the Committee reiterates the recommendation it made when it first examined the case, considering that the charges against Ruben Gonzlez do not justify his preventive detention or house arrest for years prior to the present interim measures, and requests the Government that he be compensated for the damages suffered.\n.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body].\n.The Single National Union of Public Employees of the Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (SUNEP-CVG) sent new allegations in communications dated  and  March .\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .\n.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the""]"
