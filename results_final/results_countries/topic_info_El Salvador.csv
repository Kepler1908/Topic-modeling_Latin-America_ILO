More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.\n.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.\n.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor\'s Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.\n.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers\' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.\n.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.\n.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.\n.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.\n.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.\n.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.\n.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations', 'it has no link of continuity.

Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.\n.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.\n.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .\n.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.\n.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .\n.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.\n.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.\n.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.\n.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.\n.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.\n.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.\n.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.\n.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.\n.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian;"", 'Benitez, Milton Retana and Oscar Retana; on the communication of the ICFTU dated  October concerning the arrest in Usulutn on  September  of the co-operative workers Alberto Olmedo, Bartolo Cornejo, Remberto Hernndez Flores, Leonor Pea Snchez, Antonio Prez, Sebastin Espinoza, Edwin Andrade and N.

The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.\n.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.\n.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee\'s recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.\n.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.\n.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country\'s international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.\n.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government\'s communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .\n.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.\n.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.\n.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers\' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.\n.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.\n.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.\n.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.\n.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,\n.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.\n.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.\n.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.\n.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.\n.Lastly,', '.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).\n.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.\n.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May .

Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.\n.Lastly,', '.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).\n.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.\n.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.\n.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.\n.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee\'s recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.\n.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.\n.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country\'s international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.\n.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government\'s communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .\n.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants\' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.\n.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.\n.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers\' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.\n.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.\n.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.\n.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.\n.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,\n.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.\n.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.\n.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.\n.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation.

The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""\n.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.\n.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General\'s representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.\n.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers\' organisations.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General\'s representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General\'s representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers\' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers\' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers\' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations', 'direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).\n.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.\n.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases.
