According to the allegations, this dismissal is unacceptable, inasmuch as the school\'s director has neither the authority nor the competence to act in this manner, since such procedures fall to the competence of the Ministry. According to the complainant, this case must be viewed against the background of administrative corruption, warnings and the suspensions of certain members of the OTEP. On  August  a delegation composed of teachers from the region, students, heads of households and the attorney for the Organisation\'s regional branch presented a formal complaint before the Ministry of Education. They were assured that a solution would be found to the problem of the teacher, Mrs. Hilda Montiel de Ros.\n.The International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) alleges in its communication of  November  that three members of the ""ONONDIVEPA"" National Peasants\' Union, Messrs. Arcadio Flores, Jos Melgarejo and Aurelio Pereira had been detained without a warrant on  November  by members of the armed forces in Colonia Torybet, and that their current whereabouts are unknown.\n.Moreover, IFPAAW alleges that on  November members of the third cavalry division in Curuguaty, Department of Canendiy, brutally beat a group of  peasants. On  November some  members of the army fired on a group of  peasants in Tava-I and Almeida, Guauauvi district, Department of San Pedro, and imprisoned most of them in the Curuguaty post. These are armed assaults on groups of peasants who have peacefully occupied uncultivated land in order to draw the Government\'s attention to the growing problems of over , peasants who still have no land, in spite of the Government\'s creation of the Rural Development Co-ordinating Committee.\n.The Committee deeply deplores the fact that the Government has not sent any of the information requested by the Committee and that, owing to the time elapsed, the Committee has been forced to examine the cases without the benefit of the Government\'s replies to the allegations in question. The Committee must recall the considerations presented in its First Report (para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ), which it has had to repeat on several occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, as the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be brought against them.\n.Given the seriousness of the allegations in these cases which concern, inter alia, the detention of trade unionists, various acts of anti-union discrimination and serious legal restrictions on the trade union rights of public officials and employees, the Committee deplores the Government\'s absence of co-operation with the Committee\'s procedures. The Committee urges the Government in the future to send detailed replies to allegations without delay.\n.As regards Case No. , the Committee reiterates the conclusions which it formulated at its November  meeting, namely, that the lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. and the reinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by that enterprise constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned. Bearing in mind that the authorities\' refusal to register the executive committee headed by Mr. Salcedo dates back to , the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring that legislation will facilitate the expeditious disposition of proceedings involving labour-related matters. Moreover, since the Government has provided no information concerning the declaration of illegality of the strike which, according to the complainants, was followed by  per cent of the workers of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. enterprise, the Committee again emphasises that the right to strike constitutes an essential means for workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests, and that limitations on, or the prohibition of strikes may only apply in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (those where an interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population). It considers that this definition does not cover this present case.\n.As regards Case No. , the Committee emphasises that the complainant organisation has alleged that teachers were dismissed or otherwise persecuted owing to their trade union activities. Consequently, given the Government\'s failure to reply, the Committee draws its attention to Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"", and emphasises the importance of taking remedial action against acts of anti-union discrimination.\n.In addition, the Committee deplores that the Ministry of Education and Culture reacted to the call for a national strike on  July  by the National Teachers\' Co-ordinating Body to obtain wage increases, by threatening dismissals and disqualifications. In general, on the question of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation on the trade union rights of teachers who are also public officials, the Committee emphasises that workers in the education sector should enjoy the right to establish trade union organisations, to bargain collectively and to resort to strikes (see th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), paras.  and ; see also the Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , paras. ,  and ). The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees these rights to workers in the education sector.\n.Lastly, as regards Case No.  concerning the detention and violent assaults by the armed forces on groups of peasants who, according to allegations, were peacefully occupying uncultivated lands, and concerning the detention, without warrant, of Messrs. Arcadio Flores, Jos Melgarejo and Aurelio Pereira, members of the National Peasants\' Union, the Committee regrets this climate of violence. It requests the Government to confirm whether Messrs. Flores, Melgarejo and Pereira have been released and requests all parties involved to seek to resolve peacefully disputes arising from agrarian reform and rural development.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deplores the fact that since November  the Government has failed to provide any of the information requested in these three cases. The Committee deplores the Government\'s lack of co-operation and urges it in the future to submit detailed replies without delay.(b) As regards the proceedings for the recognition of the executive committee of the trade union of the Algodonera Paraguaya S.A. (Paraguay Cotton Company), and the reinstatement of trade union leaders dismissed since , the Committee again emphasises that the absence of a court ruling over such a long period of time constitutes a denial of justice, and therefore a denial of trade union rights. The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the legislation will facilitate labour-related judicial proceedings.(c) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that workers in cotton companies do not provide an essential service in the strict sense of the term, and consequently that their right to strike should not be subject to serious restrictions or prohibitions, either in law or in practice.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation guarantees to workers in the education sector the right to establish trade unions, to bargain collectively and to strike.(e) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to Article  of Convention No. , which states that ""workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment"".

(See the Committee\'s th Report, paragraphs -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).)\n.Since the last examination of the case, the Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  September .

The Government has not sent its observations on any of the outstanding allegations, even though it has been requested to do so on several occasions.\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In a communication of  April  the WCOTP states that Mr. Juan Gabriel Espnola, the recently elected General Secretary of the Teachers\' Organisation of Paraguay']"

The Government also stated that Mr. Ojeda Falkan was interrogated on  March . The Government has sent no information on the brothers of Martino Roln Centurin or on the allegations concerning the torture and ill-treatment suffered by trade unionists in custody.\n.In its last examination of the case, the Committee observed that there was considerable delay before the decision to issue a warrant for the arrest of Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan and his interrogation: by a magistrate. The Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, expressed the hope that Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan would soon be judged and that the Government would communicate, as soon it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. Also on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body requested the Government to provide information concerning the situation of the brothers of Martino Roln Centurin and its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.\n.At its meetings in February, May and November , the Committee had to postpone its examination of this case, as it had not received the information requested of the Government. At its meeting in February  the Committee again postponed its examination of the case for the same reason. Accordingly, the Governing Body notified the Government that in conformity with the procedure of the Committee, the latter might present a report on the substance of the matter at its next session, even if the observations of the Government were not received by that date. The Committee has not yet received this information.\n.In these circumstances, and before examining the substance of the case, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the considerations set forth in its First Report, which it has repeated on various occasions, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.\n.The Committee expresses its deep concern that the Government has not sent the observations which have been requested of it on repeated occasions and that, given the time which has elapsed, it is compelled to examine the case without having received them.\n.As regards the allegations relating to Domingo Melchor and Santiago Roln Centurin and Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, the Committee recalls that it has emphasised that the detention of trade union officials, even for reasons of internal security, may constitute a grave interference with trade union rights unless accompanied by the appropriate judicial safeguards. In many cases where allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or sentenced on account of trade union activities have been refuted by governments or met with statements that the arrest or detention was made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information as precise as possible concerning the alleged measures, and in particular concerning the judicial proceedings taken, and to supply the texts of sentences pronounced, together with the reasons adduced therefore, to enable it to examine the allegations with full knowledge of the facts.\n.As regards the allegations of ill-treatment of workers in custody, the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the right of trade unionists, as of all other persons, to enjoy the guarantees afforded by due process of law in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its deep concern that, despite the requests made, the Government has not sent the information requested and that the Committee has been obliged to examine the case without having received these observations;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, and in particular to the principle that the detention of trade union officials may constitute a grave interference with trade union rights unless attended by the appropriate judicial safeguards;(c) to urge the Government to keep the Committee informed of the situation of the Roln Centurin brothers and the proceedings against Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, and to communicate the text of the judgement given, with the reasons adduced therefore;(d) to urge the Government to send the Committee its observations on the allegations of ill-treatment of trade unionists in custody.\n.The Committee already examined this case in November  when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The complainants stated that the Christian-inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. They also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised and expressed the view that a skirmish in April  between the armed forces and a group of guerilleros had been used as a pretext for attacking any organisation working to bring about social reform and an improvement in the miserable lot of the peasants.\n.The allegations outstanding refer, first of all, to the peasants' trade union leaders Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez who, the complainants alleged, had been arrested and tortured at the beginning of may . They added that another active peasants' trade unionist, Severo Delgado, had, about the same time, been sought by the police who had raided his house; he had managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also mentioned the disappearance, on  April , of the peasants' trade union leader, Martin Roln Centurin. The complainants had reason to believe that he was alive and in custody at a National Guard barracks and had been subjected to torture; he had never been charged with any offence nor brought to trial nor convicted. The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) specified that the person in question had been wounded on the day of his arrest while trying to defend his home. He was in solitary confinement and in a piteous state. The three brothers of Martin Roln Centurin were also in custody: Domingo at the Investigation Department (where there were said to be torture chambers), and Melchor and Santiago, against whom legal proceedings were pending, at Emboscada Penitentiary.\n.The Government stated that there had at no time been any infringement of freedom of association; no genuine trade union leader, past or present, had ever been hindered in the performance of his functions. As for the others, the Government stated that it had no knowledge of their whereabouts and refuted the allegations made, claiming that those who were active and knowledgeable in the labour field and who acted within the framework of the Constitution and the national law, had never mentioned having difficulties of any kind whatsoever inside or outside their unions. As to Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, they were still in Emboscada Prison, awaiting trial by the ordinary courts on charges of contravening Act No.  respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom. These facts showed clearly, continued the Government, that these persons did not belong to any trade union or suchlike organisation operating lawfully in Paraguay.\n.The Committee considered that it needed further information on these various points and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body requested the Government, in particular:- to supply detailed information as to the specific acts Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jose Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez were said to have committed and to communicate, as soon as they were pronounced, the texts of the judgements handed down in respect of these persons and the reasons adduced therefor;- to supply also information as to the situation of Severo Delgado and Martin Roln Centurin, and the latter's brothers, and the specific acts of which they were accused, to state"", ' February .\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The allegations which remain outstanding in this case relate to the assault by members of the pro-government party against doctors and nurses at the Clnicas Hospital who were attending to persons who had been injured during a trade union demonstration held on  May ; the detention of trade union leaders Raquel Aquino (March ), Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Arcadio Flores and Teodoro Gonzlez ( May ); the dismissal, for trade union reasons, of trade union leader Sebastin Rodrguez in ; and to certain legislative questions which had been brought to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n.As regards the above-mentioned outstanding allegations, the Governing Body, at its November  meeting, adopted a number of recommendations at the invitation of the Committee:(a) The Committee notes with interest that the Government has replied to certain allegations, but regrets that it has as yet supplied no observations on several of the serious allegations made against it by the complainants.(b) Consequently, on the factual issues, the Committee once again requests the Government to state whether it is correct that members of the pro-government party assaulted doctors and nurses on hospital premises who were treating persons injured by the forces of order when a trade union demonstration was repressed on  May , as affirmed by the ICFTU in a communication of  May , and if so to state whether a judicial inquiry has been instituted following this repression to determine who is responsible.(c) The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the ICFTU\'s allegations dated  April  and  May  respectively concerning the imprisonment in March  of Raquel Aquino, a leader of secondary-school students, in the Pastor prison and the arrest, on  May , of agricultural workers\' leaders Marcelino Corazn Medina, Pedro Gamana, Carmelino Torales, Arcadio Flores and Teodoro Gonzlez. In particular, it requests the Government to state precisely on what grounds they were imprisoned, to furnish the text of the court judgements concerning them if they have been tried, and to specify whether these persons have since been released.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the outcome of the appeal against dismissal lodged by the trade union leader Sebastin Rodrguez, former General Secretary of the Bus Drivers\' Union (Route No. ) who is said to have been dismissed in  for trade union reasons.\n.In its telegram of  December , the ICFTU alleges that on  December  the following trade union leaders were detained in different parts of the country: Oscar Acosta, Secretary General of the Journalists\' and Radio Caritas Trade Union; Marina Arrn, trade union leader of the Royal Bank of Paraguay; Elsa Mereles, President of the Asuncin Clnicas Hospital Workers\' and Nurses\' Association. The ICFTU affirms that these trade union leaders were detained without just cause three days before the so-called ""March for Life"", a demonstration convened by the Inter-Trade Union Workers\' Movement (MIT), was to be held.\n.In another telegram of  December  the ICFTU expresses its concern over a new series of arrests mainly involving the leaders of the MIT. The persons concerned are: Ronald Orrego, Edilberto Vargas, Gabriel Espnola, Celso Velzquez, Juan Galiano, Juanita Arracela and Teresa Godoy. These persons are being detained in the prisons of the National Guard.\n.In a telegram of  January  the ICFTU alleges that the ""Hoy"" publishing house dismissed all trade union leaders and delegates belonging to the Asuncin Journalists\' Trade Union. These dismissals took place while negotiations were being held with the trade union concerning the introduction of new technologies. The trade unionists are: Eduardo Arce, Ramn Casco, Estela Rufenelli, Marit Ocampos, Teresa Godoy, Idilio Mndez, Hugo Villalba and five other workers.\n.In a communication of  February  the ICFTU expresses its concern over the police harassment of the Construction Workers\' Trade Union (SINATRAC) since  January, which has paralysed that organisation\'s trade union activities. The ICFTU states that repression against workers is getting worse and is taking the form of beatings, detentions, bureaucratic obstacles in public institutions and ""visits"" to trade union premises without warrants. It also adds that on  October  Messrs. Nazario Valiente, Juan Manuel Villalba, Gerardo Mercedes Brites, Higinio Candia, Gilberto Domnguez and Basilio Pereira, members of the SINATRAC, were clubbed and threatened by members of the police force as they were leaving the union\'s premises.\n.The ""visits"" to trade union premises in October and November  were carried out by police officers who proceeded to interrogate trade union officials about the operations, time and place of meetings and names of persons who had visited such premises. Moreover, a high-level official of the Police Investigation Department also visited trade union premises where meetings were being held by various union executive committees, and conducted interrogations without furnishing any explanation.\n.In a telegram dated  January  the Government refers to the dismissal of workers of the ""Hoy"" publishing house, and in this connection states that the complainant has made tendentious allegations with a view to implicating the Government; in fact, the dismissal of these workers was the result of a managerial decision taken unilaterally by a private enterprise, which informed the Labour Directorate on  January  of its decision to terminate the employment contract of these workers. The Government\'s communication states that, to date, none of the workers concerned has appealed to the labour administration bodies to denounce his or her dismissal or any violation of freedom of association.\n.In its communication of  September  the Government states that since  May , the Government has been headed by General Andrs Rodrguez, who was elected as constitutional President of the Republic of Paraguay. The arbitrary administrative actions carried out by the officials of the previous government reflect procedures, attitudes and events that belong to the past, a past which both the people and the Government of Paraguay hope never to see again. The Government assures the ILO that the new national Government guarantees the full freedom of the trade union movement, as well as its security, in accordance with the national Constitution, the Labour Code and the Conventions and Recommendations ratified by Paraguay.\n.Specifically in connection with this case, the Government\'s communication states that no trade union leader is currently being detained, and that on the contrary, the trade unionists who are alleged to have been persecuted and detained by the previous regime, such as Marcelino Corazn Medina, enjoy their full freedom. This trade unionist, in particular, enjoys full freedom of action and expression as a leader of workers and peasants, and more recently, as a political activist in the Workers\' Party, which has been recognised and registered in the Central Electoral Council.\n.As regards the situation of doctors and nurses of the Clnicas Hospital, the Government states that their situation has been completely rectified. The reasons which led to their struggle with the previous regime have been given full consideration by the new Government, which ordered the complete restoration of the old building, and provided the hospital with all infrastructures necessary for its operations. In addition, it has met their demands for higher wages. To date, the Government adds, there is no discontent among the hospital\'s employees; they enjoy full freedom and guarantees in the exercise of their activities. The Government adds that, at the present time, all ""illegal"" restrictions imposed by the previous regime, such as detentions and torture, are being denounced and investigated by the courts on an individual basis and in accordance with the law. The complaints presented to the ILO concern events which took place during the previous regime, and the new Government has no responsibility in this connection. However, any cases brought before the competent authorities of the country which may affect trade unionists will be duly examined.\n.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Sebastin Rodrguez, former General Secretary of the Bus Drivers\' Union (Route No. ) of Fernando de la Mora, the Government states that the Labour Court ordered his reinstatement. Recently, the Labour Directorate, by means of Resolution No.  of  March , approved the registration of the new executive committee of the trade union headed by Mr. Sebastin Rodrguez.\n.The Committee notes that the Government has sent some of the information requested by the Committee; it also notes that since  May  there is a new Government in Paraguay, which affirms its total commitment to freedom of association. However, the Committee wishes to point out that when examining allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights by one government, the Committee has indicated that there existed a link of continuity between successive governments of the same State, and that while a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a former government, it is clearly responsible for any continuing consequences which these events may have', 'whether legal proceedings had been instituted against them and, if so, to communicate the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;- to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.\n.The Government replied in a letter dated  September . It states that a warrant for Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan\'s arrest was issued on  December ; he is being charged in the ""Carlos Guillermo Braas and others"" case for contravening the aforementioned Act No. /. He is accused of involvement with a subversive group known as the military Political Organisation (OPM), which has been engaged in clandestine activities in the country. The discovery of one of its cells by the police, continues the Government, led to an armed confrontation at the beginning of April . Three members of the OPM, including Martin Roln Centurin, were wounded and later died; two police officers were also wounded. Jose Gill Ojeda Falkan is being held in Emboscada Prison. In March , he was interrogated and the report of his interrogation has been placed in his file. The Government notes that its information concerning Martin Roln Centurin derives from a report of the penal court of first instance.\n.The Government goes on to say that Jos Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado were released from custody on  December ,  April  and  March , respectively. It concludes that none of the people referred to have been brought to trial for exercising trade union activities since none of them belong to any legally constituted union organisation.\n.On the latter point, the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it did when it previously examined this case, that the fact that national organisations of workers have not been officially recognised is no justification for the rejection of allegations if it is clear from the complaints that these organisations have at least a de facto existence.\n.The Committees notes the information supplied by the Government on the circumstances of the death of Martin Roln Centurin. It also takes note of the release from custody of Jose Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado. The fact remains, however, that Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez at least, after their arrest at the beginning of May , were imprisoned for many months without it being apparent from available information that they had been tried. Moreover, the Government has not indicated the specific acts for which they were imprisoned. Admittedly, the mere fact of carrying on a trade union activity or holding responsibilities in a trade union does not imply any immunity from ordinary penal legislation. However, unless it is duly established in a court of law that they have contravened this legislation, the prolonged detention of trade unionists is liable to appear as a hindrance to the normal operation of a union organisation and as a means of intimidating its militants and even its rank-and-file members.\n.In the case of Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, too, there was considerable delay between the decision to issue a warrant for his arrest and his interrogation by a magistrate. In fact, legal proceedings against him are still pending. The Committee trusts that he will soon be judged by an ordinary court and that the Government will communicate the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefor so that the Committee can be sure that the person concerned is not being held for legitimate union activities.\n.The Government, finally, has not provided its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note with interest the release of Jos Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado, while drawing the Government\'s attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph ;(b) to take note with regret the incidents described by the Government in its communication which led to the death of Martin Roln Centurin; to request the Government once again to provide information concerning the situation of the brothers of Mr. Centurin and to state whether legal proceedings have been instituted against them;(c) to express the hope that Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan will soon be judged and that the Government will communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;(d) to request the Government once again to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody;(e) to take note of this interim report.\n.The complaints of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) are contained in two letters dated respectively  July and  July . The CLAT supplied further information in communications dated  July  and  July . The WCL also provided additional information in a letter dated  August .\n.The Government communicated certain observations by a letter dated  August . As authorised under the procedure, the Director-General, considering - without going into the substance of the issue - that this letter did not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to examine the case, wrote on behalf of the Committee directly to the Government pointing out that it would be desirable for it to supply more specific information concerning the points raised by the complainants. In May , this information still not having been received despite repeated requests, the Committee appealed to the Government to supply the information requested as a matter of urgency. The Government replied by a letter dated  September .\n.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The CLAT, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisation, the National Central of Urban Workers (CNTU), stated in its communications of July  that the leaders of the trade unions connected with the CLAT, as well as the peasants\' movement, were being subjected to attacks and persecution. It mentioned in particular the names of the following leaders, who, it claimed, had been arrested and tortured at the beginning of may :- Emigdio Colman Nuez, General Secretary of the CNTU, arrested with his -year old son;- Oscar Vicente Rodas, leader of the urban sector, joiner, arrested with his -year old daughter and his -year old son;- Julian Flor, Jos Ojeda, Jos Parra, Fretez and other leaders of the peasants\' movement.The complainant also mentioned the closing down of the John XXIII People\'s Institute, founded by the Christian Central of workers - now the CNTU - for the benefit of the country\'s youth..The CLAT also described incidents which had occurred during the same period in the town of Pedro Juan caballero, involving trade union leaders: Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln had been arrested and taken to the offices of the government delegation, where they were held for  days; Severo Delgado, an active peasants\' trade unionist, was wanted by the police, who raided his house; he managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The CLAT expressed the opinion that the Christian inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. It also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised.\n.The CLAT also described incidents which had occurred during the same period in the town of Pedro Juan caballero, involving trade union leaders: Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln had been arrested and taken to the offices of the government delegation, where they were held for  days; Severo Delgado, an active peasants\' trade unionist, was wanted by the police, who raided his house; he managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The CLAT expressed the opinion that the Christian inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. It also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised.\n.The WCL also referred in its letter of  July  to the arrest on  and  May  of a number of the persons mentioned by the CLAT. It drew attention to the violence and repression being unleashed against trade unionists, especially leaders and militants in the peasants\' sector. It expressed the view that a skirmish in April  between the armed forces and a group of guerrilleros had been used as a pretext for attacking any organisation working to bring about social reform and an improvement in the miserable lot of the peasants.\n.The CLAT added in its letter of  July  - claiming to speak on behalf of the Christian agrarian leagues of Paraguay - that the peasants\' trade union leader Martino Roln Centurin had disappeared mysteriously on  April , no doubt arrested by the National Guard. The complainants had reason to believe that he was alive and in custody at a National Guard barracks, and had been subjected to torture. He had never been charged with any offence, nor brought to trial, nor convicted. The WCL\'s communication of ']"

The complainants allege that, as a result of this ruling, the payment of money owed to the workers was prevented;(ii) Ruling No.  of  November , referred to above, declaring articles  and  of the collective agreement ' which had previously recognized the trade unions' right to nominate workers for recruitment ' to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it could undermine possible pay increases for non-unionized workers. According to the complainant organizations, although the assembly s minutes conferring an express mandate had been submitted under aforementioned Ruling No. , the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the trade union concerned (SAPAC) was not authorized to file a claim for the payment of wages (accrued prior to the declaration of unconstitutionality) and that each individual union member should file his own claim, which, according to the complainants, was impossible as a claim could only be filed for the total amount that was alleged to be unpaid; and(iii) Ruling No.  of  October  regarding the claim for reimbursement of US$ million to workers who had contributed to the defunct National Workers' Bank. The Court, while again recognizing that the ensuing deregulation could be deemed to be arbitrary and to distort the purpose of the trade union, rejected the claim on the basis of the doctrine underlying aforementioned Ruling No. , finding that the trade unions did not have an express mandate from their members to bring the legal action or the necessary legal capacity (in this regard, the complainant organizations claim that the trade unions had submitted the requisite powers of attorney to file the claim). The complainants add that, as a result of this decision, the money owed was never reimbursed.\n.In its communications of  January , the Government submits the observations of the enterprise and of the public authorities concerned.\n.In its observations, the enterprise denies the allegations and indicates the following: (i) the San Francisco SA enterprise is responsible for private operations in Caacupe-m port, while the Jerovi Servicios SA enterprise is responsible for outsourcing certain services, and they have both been inspected by the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, which found that they comply with the labour regulations; (ii) there was a contractual relationship for the provision of services between Jerovi Servicios SA and various trade unions (Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu and SEMA from the Caacupe-m district, both members of LOMP); (iii) the trade unions themselves acted as employers, in other words, they provided services through their registered workers; (iv) the enterprises did not dismiss any workers since the latter were not their employees; (v) in November , as a result of a dispute between the trade unions and the enterprises relating to service contracts, LOMP and the trade unions took industrial action entailing the closure of the Paraguay River and of land access points to Caacupe-m port; (vi) the enterprise terminated the service contracts with the trade unions, alleging serious non-compliance on their part ' including the consequences of the industrial action taken by the trade unions; (vii) on  February , a tripartite conciliation meeting was held at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in which: (a) the trade unions indicated that  rather than  people had been dismissed; (b) the enterprise explained that it had not filed the criminal proceedings against the workers for their involvement in the industrial action (they had been filed by the Public Prosecutor s Office) and that it would not oppose any requests to lift the detention measures; (c) the possibility of restoring the original conditions prior to the dispute was discussed and the enterprise declared its willingness to employ any workers who might be interested, but stated that recruitment could not be imposed purely according to whether or not a dockworker belonged to a specific trade union organization, whereupon the parties agreed that the only requirement would be the registration of dockworkers with the Prefecture-General for Shipping; and (d) the tripartite meeting resulted in an agreement between the parties to work in good faith to resolve the situation of the  workers who were being prosecuted, to initiate negotiations to re-establish the contractual relations governing the delivery of services and to drop all judicial, extrajudicial and trade union actions, as a sign of good faith; (viii) however, the negotiations were not successful, given that the trade unions did not drop the judicial actions that they had filed; (ix) as regards the alleged refusal to hire union members, the enterprise states that: (a) the statement is incorrect and LOMP s true intention is to restrict recruitment to trade union members; (b) LOMP filed a legal action seeking to ban the enterprises from hiring non-union members (arguing that the right to work in the area is limited to these unions, to which the enterprises responded that the law guarantees their right to hire staff freely); the enterprise indicates that the legal action was subsequently dropped by LOMP; and (c) it is LOMP which is violating freedom of association by excluding the possibility of hiring workers who are not its members and by restricting the freedom of association of non-unionized workers; (x) as regards the alleged refusal to sign a collective agreement, the two trade unions referred to above are the employers of those they refer to as members, and so there is a legal obstacle to their signing a collective agreement, given that the document cannot be signed by more than one employer; (xi) as regards the allegation of violation by the enterprise of the rule that only trade union members are allowed to work in a given jurisdiction, the enterprise alleges that the rule was established under the previous Labour Code, which included a provision whereby collective agreements could contain a clause under which the employer was obliged only to hire workers who were members of the trade union party to the agreement; according to the enterprise, this is an old provision which runs counter to the Constitution of Paraguay and to the ILO Conventions.\n.As regards the allegation of anti-union discrimination (dismissal of workers and non-recruitment of union members), the Government indicates that, following the complaint concerning the mass dismissal of members of the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers of Zeballos Cu and the Trade Union of Maritime Dockworkers and Related Services (SEMA) of the Caacupe-m district, the representatives of the private port of San Francisco Caacupe-m and the representatives of the complainant trade unions were called to two tripartite meetings at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in September . When the enterprise representative failed to attend the second meeting, the workers' representatives requested a general inspection, which resulted in an inspection order dated  October  to review the employment situation of the dockworkers concerned and the employer s compliance with the regulations. At the first two attempts, the inspectors were unable to conduct the inspection owing to the refusal of the enterprise s legal adviser, who claimed that the inspectors could only enter the premises to conduct the inspection if they had a court order. The inspection was carried out at the third attempt, on  October . The Government indicates that the inspection found that the workers alleging the violation of their rights were members of the trade union organizations of maritime dockworkers but that they were not employees of the enterprise in question.\n.As regards the allegations of refusal of collective bargaining, the Government provides a list of  collective agreements governing conditions of work which were approved for the years  to  and were signed by maritime and river enterprises (the two enterprises operating in Caacupe-m port referred to above do not appear on the list).\n.As regards the allegations of violations of freedom of association and of dispersal of workers participating in protest actions on the Paraguay River on  December , the Government submits a note from the Prefecture-General for Shipping, which indicates that: (i) this institution acted within the framework of legality and in compliance with a judicial order of  November  issued by the Civil and Commercial Judge of First Instance, ordering the end of the blockade of the Paraguay River at all points; and (ii) the dockworkers were notified in due time and form but they refused to comply with the ruling, whereupon the persons involved were arrested and handed over to the Public Prosecutor s Office.\n.The Government adds that the right to strike is guaranteed for workers in both the public and private sectors and that, in the case referred to in this complaint, the striking workers blockaded the Paraguay River, affecting the free passage and movement of vessels, which was aggravated by the fact that the country is landlocked and the Paraguay River is its main waterway. Accordingly, the Government indicates that article  of the Criminal Code was applied, which provides that any person who creates an"", ""decided to file an appeal but that the Court had not seen the document.

The Committee adjourns its examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced, and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets the detention of five trade union leaders and trade unionists of the National Union of Construction Workers.(b) The Committee reiterates the principle that the detention of trade union leaders for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) In view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than  days and that none of the five trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee stresses the principle that any person who is detained must be brought without delay before the competent court.Case No. (a) The Committee considers that the decision of  October  of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee of SINATRAC, elected by the assembly held on  October , taken in full awareness that another regularly convened assembly was to be held for the same purpose a few days later on  October, constitutes an arbitrary and too speedy decision.(b) The Committee draws attention to the fact that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation, they should be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to change what it calls the methods of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if objectively considered, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.(b) The Committee notes that Mr. Marcelino Corazn Medina has been released. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the alleged torture of this trade union leader stating what were the concrete facts leading to his detention, as well as on the detention of Sebastin Rodrguez, Secretary-General of the Drivers\' Trade Union of Line .\n.The complaint is contained in communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  and  May ; additional information was submitted in communications dated  October and  December . The Government replied in a communication dated  September .\n.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communications dated  and  May , the complainant alleges that, through the Ministry of Labour and Political Police, the Government of Paraguay has engaged in repressive activities against the trade union organisations which have set up the Trade Union Solidarity Movement (MSS), which published its constitution and objectives on  September  in a paid advertisement in the daily newspaper ""ABC Color"". The complainant adds that, under the pretense that they are advocating ""a vast plan of Marxist agitation"", the police have been arresting many members of this trade union organisation, the MSS, and carrying out arbitrary searches and unlawful acts of repression in the middle of the night.For example, they have arrested Rubn Lisboa (a leader of the Banco del Brasil Trade Union and Federation of Bank Employees (FETRABAN)), Abel Grange (a shop employee), Gustavo Codas (an ABC Color journalist and member of the Union of Journalists of Paraguay (SPP)), Roberto Villalba, Stella Rufinelli, Margarita Musse, Margarita Elas, Sonia Duque de Arriaza, Sonia Aquino, Desiderio Arzamendia, Benjamn Livieres, Silvano Presentado Acosta, Eulalia Leguizamn, Damin Vera (all employees of the Paraguayan Data Bank (BPD), an advisory institution specialising in the analysis and compilation of national data), Rubn Mir, Javier Joy Salomoni, Fernando Rodrguez Alcal, Juan Carlos Oviedo and Mara Herminia Feliciangeli (university leaders).\n.The complainant further alleges that the Minister of the Interior has threatened to send the union leaders, university leaders and journalists who are members of the SPP into exile.\n.The complainant states, moreover, that ABC Color, which published the notice announcing the setting up of the MSS, has been systematically threatened and that its free circulation has been restricted and unlawfully hindered by the police who hold up the vehicles distributing the newspaper every day. On  May , police officers surrounded the newspaper\'s premises early in the morning and seized the copies that were to be sent to the interior of the country.\n.In its communications dated  October and  December , the complainant indicates that the MSS members cited in its earlier communication are still being held in custody and that their state of health is extremely alarming as a few weeks before they went on an indefinite hunger strike.\n.The complainant states that for the past four years the Union of Journalists of Paraguay has been seeking legal personality through the Ministry of Justice and Labour but that its efforts have been in vain because of the systematic refusal of the authorities to grant the Union legal authorisation. Regarding the Union\'s leaders, the complainant notes that the Secretary, Mr. Codas Friessmand, is still in asylum in the Venezuelan embassy from where he has been unable to obtain a safe conduct to leave the country and that the Secretary-General, Mr. Alcibiades Gonzlez del Valle, an ABC Color journalist, was arrested on  September ""on orders from above"" and, once in prison, was accused of infringing Act No.  on ""the defence of democracy"". Furthermore, on  July  Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo Director of ABC Color, was arrested for allowing publication of and comments on the events which give rise to the present complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association. Moreover, Dr. Jorge Alvarenga and Dr. Carlos Cuevas, of the University Hospital, were arrested by the police during a round-table discussion on ""Trade unionism and repression""; some days later Dr. Alvarenga was expelled from the country, while Dr. Cuevas is still in prison.\n.The complainant further alleges that, in the La Americana S.A. textile company, a large number of workers have been arbitrarily dismissed following the submission by the trade unions of a list of demands. At the FRISA S.A. company, where the trade unions requested payment of wages due since June , the undertaking reacted by threatening the mass dismissal of  workers.\n.Finally, the complainant alleges that Radio anduti (ZP ) was closed down for transmitting messages from the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile on  August . At the same time, the National Telecommunications Administration (ANTELCO), a State institution, banned the commentator and director of the radio station, Humberto Rubin, from exercising his profession.\n.Referring to the alleged arrests, the Government states that on  August  the judge of the Criminal Court of First Instance ordered the release of Antonio Pez, Hans Grossen, Raquel Rojas de Carmona, Sonia Duque de Arriaza, Fernando Esteban Rodriguez Alcal Zuccolillo, Javier Antonio Joy Salomoni, Jos Rubn Mir and Eulalia Leguizamn, eight of the  persons charged with infringing Act No.  on the defence of law and order and freedom of the individual, which outlaws communism in Paraguay and provides for the trial and punishment of any person charged with subversive behaviour. The acting magistrate accepted the plea of the counsel for the defence and therefore ordered their release. The Government observes that the persons released were not directly involved in running the Paraguayan Data Bank, whose activities the police deemed to be subversive and a threat to the security of the State. Of those cited, Antonio Pez, Fernando E. Rodrguez Alcal Zuccolillo and Javier A. Joy Salomoni own two printing works where some of the publications of the Paraguayan Data Bank were printed.\n.Concerning the  other persons charged (Sonia Cristina Aquino, Rubn Lisboa, Benjamn Ramos Livieres, Victoria Abel Granje, Silbano Presentado Acosta, Desiderio Arzamendia, Juan Francisco Arrn Suhurt, Agustn Chamorro, Roberto Villalba Esquivel, Ernest Grossen, Margarita Mussi and Josefina Frasqueri), the examining magistrate confirmed their prison sentences and they therefore remained in state penitentiaries. Subsequently, on  September , nine of those arrested for infringing the aforementioned Act and implicated in the Paraguayan Data Bank trial were released by the Criminal Appeals Court. As to the three other persons arrested (Ernest Grossen, Desiderio Arzamendia and Roberto Villalba Esquivel), the Criminal Appeals Court of Feria overturned the decision of the lower court judge on  January  and granted their release.\n.The Government adds that on  January  the judge of the Criminal Court of First Instance of Feria revoked the prison sentence handed down on Mara Elizeche, Mnica Prez Cayetano Quatrolucchi and Luis Ernesto Heisecke, who had been subsequently charged along with the others.\n.Consequently, continues the Government, all  persons initially']"
