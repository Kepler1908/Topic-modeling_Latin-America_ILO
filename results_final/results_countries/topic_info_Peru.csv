The Government emphasizes that in Rulings Nos --AI/TC and --PA-TC, the Constitutional Court made it clear that collective bargaining involving public servants must be done, taking into consideration the constitutional limit, according to which the budget must be balanced and fair. The Government adds that similar conclusions have also been put forward by the Supreme Court of Justice in Appeal No. --Lambayeque, which states that collective bargaining must be carried out in the public sector, taking into account the national budgetary laws which determine the scope of negotiation.\n.The Government states that, notwithstanding the above, it emerged that in various arbitration awards the arbitrators adopted contrary, and even challenging, positions, stating expressly in their pronouncements that the budgetary restrictions established in the public sector budget laws would not be applied, ordering increases in wages without any technical support or identifiable source of funding, which affect the principle of a balanced budget and create disorder in the public sector, and that the National Congress chose to regulate this situation, by including the provision in the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , which is brought into question by the CTP.\n.In its communications dated  and  September , the Government made its observations concerning the allegations relating to the Civil Service Act, No. . As to the allegation that the Act excludes public servants, public managers and trusted servants from the right to join trade unions, the Government indicates that although no such exclusion exists in the strict sense of the term, a rule should be created which specifies the scope for the purposes of clearer interpretation. As regards the allegation that the Act allows, in the case of a strike, staff to be hired temporarily in order to guarantee the provision of minimum services in essential services and in services vital for the entity to operate, the Government understands that this provision would not cause problems of compatibility with the ILO Conventions, provided that the requirements established in the Act are satisfied, that is, the services defined as essential are determined according to the criteria of the ILO supervisory bodies, the minimum services are defined with the participation of workers' organizations, and replacement workers are hired only where the minimum services have not been covered by the organization or workers exercising their right to strike and this situation leads to a serious risk to human life, safety or health. With respect to the allegation that the Act limits the right to collective bargaining by requiring to negotiate for a period of two years, the Government stresses that the Committee on Freedom of Association has held that  the duration of collective agreements is primarily a matter for the parties involved.' As concerns the allegation that the Act limits the right to collective bargaining, restricting its content only to working conditions and excluding therefrom, and from any other participatory mechanism, subjects relating to wages or of economic significance, the Government understands that the Act may be viewed as taking a backward step in the recognition and effectiveness of a fundamental right such as collective bargaining, and considers that these aspects should be included in a legislative provision. On the last point, the Government reports that on  May , the Plenum of the Constitutional Court issued a ruling which settled the case of failure to observe the Constitution brought by  members of the National Congress against various articles of the Act. The Government notes that, although under section  of the Basic Law of the Constitutional Court, the majority of votes required to declare valid the allegations contained in the complaint relating to the unconstitutional nature of Act No. , since it adversely affects the right to collective bargaining, three of the judges consider that the exclusion of remuneration and budgetary matters from collective bargaining constitutes an infringement of the aforementioned constitutional right. Moreover, a further three judges consider that Act No.  will be constitutional only if, within  days, a consultation mechanism is set up. Finally, the Government emphasizes that in both cases the Constitutional Court used the ILO Conventions ratified by Peru as a benchmark of constitutionality.\n.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the hiring of staff during a strike constitutes a measure of an exceptional nature, the new regulations prescribe that it is applicable in situations in which minimum services are not respected. With respect to collective bargaining, the abovementioned Act defines the scope of the right to collective bargaining and is justified by the fact that it avoids differences that currently exist in regard to the negotiation of wages and the disorder that may result from different rules in the negotiation of wages based on the employment relationship of the worker. The Act establishes technical and objective criteria for increasing wages and takes into account the principle of budgetary provision.\n.The Committee notes that in both cases the allegations refer to legal restrictions and, in practice, to collective bargaining in the public sector and, in particular, the impossibility to increase public sector wages through collective bargaining. Case No.  refers essentially to the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , No. , and more precisely to the th final supplementary provision which, according to the allegations of the complainant organizations, the FTLF and the CGTP, prohibits wage increases for workers through collective bargaining. The above provision states, inter alia, that negotiation or labour arbitration proceedings may contain only working conditions; that arbitration resolutions, agreements or awards which ignore said prohibition will be null and void ipso jure, and that arbitrators who fail to implement that provision will no longer be entitled to participate in public sector collective bargaining arbitration processes.\n.According to the complainant organization, the FTLF, and as confirmed by the Government, FONAFE must comply with the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year  and, as a result, state electrical companies in FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The complainant organization also alleges that FONAFE establishes wage ceilings for state electrical companies that comply with the budget assigned for state companies, limiting the possibilities of negotiating wage increases through collective bargaining. The FTLF also objects to Ministerial Resolution No.  -TR, of  October , which obliges the arbitrators in collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget.\n.Case No.  refers essentially to the Civil Service Act, No. , issued in July  which according to the allegations of the complainant organizations, the CGTP, the CTP, SUTSA INIA, FESUTSA and the FTM-Per, restricts collective bargaining in all public entities to working conditions only, and excludes from negotiation, and any other participatory mechanism, subjects relating to wages or of economic significance. The above Act states, inter alia, that civil servants have the right to request improved non-monetary compensation, including changes to working or employment conditions, in accordance with the budgetary and infrastructure possibilities of the entity and the nature of the functions performed therein.\n.The Committee notes the Government s observations in which it states that the exercise of the right to collective bargaining for public sector workers, in the same way as any other right, is not absolute, but is subject to the limitations of the law, including those which regulate budgetary matters. In this connection, the Government explains that, in accordance with the General National Budget System Act, No. , FONAFE establishes, through its guidelines or directives, a wage ceiling in accordance with the budget assigned for state companies, so as to be able to implement their operational and strategic plans, and thus make them sustainable. The Government maintains that the actions or measures taken by FONAFE are carried out or performed on the basis of imperative or public order rules, without infringing any trade union rights.\n.In relation to the allegation of the complainant organizations, the FTLF and the CGTP, that the th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , No. , prohibits increases in workers' wages through collective bargaining and that, as a result, state electrical companies in FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses, the Committee notes that the Government states that FONAFE and companies in its sphere must comply with the Public Sector Budget Act for the Fiscal Year , and that therefore the actions or measures taken by FONAFE are carried out or performed on the basis of imperative or public order rules, without infringing any trade union rights. The Government explains that the aim of the rules governing the state public"", ""remuneration of all SUNAT workers should be standardized. Mr Montoya was therefore granted professional III status, which increased his salary from ,. to ,. nuevos soles and, from January , to , nuevos soles. The Government adds that it is true that the labour administration authority fined SUNAT, but the fine was revoked by the higher authority in Resolution No. --MTPE//. on the basis of the arguments set out. Taking into account the Government s arguments and information and the promotion and salary increases from which union official Mr Edmstines Montoya Jara has benefited, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.\n.With regard to its recommendation concerning the disciplinary proceedings against union representatives for alleged misuse of email (Defence Secretary Ms Mara Covarrubias and communication and public relations secretary Mr Jorge Carrillo Vrtiz), in which the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the inquiry to be conducted in that regard, the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the labour administration authority ruled that SUNAT had committed no offence against Mr Carrillo because legal provisions exist concerning the use of email in public institutions; and () the labour administration authority issued an inspection order in . The Committee requests the Government to send the administrative authority s existing and future decisions concerning these two officials. The Committee observes that restricting the union s use of email is an important issue for the union and one which caused collective bargaining to break down. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that SUNAT has made improvements in its facilities for unions (such as the use of notice boards to publicize information) and points out that the union did not include the issue of email use among the matters to be dealt with in arbitration over its list of demands for ' . Although it has taken account of this information provided by the Government, the Committee recalls that workers' representatives should enjoy such facilities as may be necessary for the proper exercise of their functions, including access to workplaces and the use of email. Recalling that access to employers' facilities should not be exercised to the detriment of the efficient functioning of the enterprise concerned, the Committee suggests that the employer and the workers' organization strive to reach agreement on the modalities for the use of email.\n.With regard to the Committee s recommendations requesting the Government to send its comments on the complainant s allegations that the administrative authority authorized SUNAT (the employer) to express its views on the declaration of a strike on  and  November , the Committee takes note of the Government s statements that: () the allegation refers to the declaration of inadmissibility (made by the administrative authority) concerning the complainant s notification of the timing of this strike; and () during the appeals procedure, the administrative authority identified irregularities in voting (the records do not state whether the decision was adopted by a ballot of members present and eligible to vote, as stipulated in the union s statutes; furthermore, the total number of members from Lima who attended the assembly does not match either the number given in other documents or the total stated in point  of the sworn declaration made by the union s executive committee). The Government adds that SUNAT s alleged authorization by the administrative authority to express its views on the declaration of a strike stems from the fact that both the union and SUNAT are entitled to challenge administrative decisions. The Committee takes note of this information.\n.The Committee takes note of the allegations made by the CATP concerning practices by SUNAT, during negotiations on SINAUT SUNAT s list of demands for ' , that go against the principles of collective bargaining and good faith (delaying tactics, lack of specific proposals during the direct negotiation phase, lack of willingness to find solutions to demands of an economic nature on the grounds that budgetary limits must be respected, counter-proposals on non-economic issues, put forward by SUNAT during the conciliation phase, that did not represent any real improvement, communication from SUNAT to the union right in the middle of conciliation proceedings instructing it to refrain from using the email system for union purposes that had always previously been accepted). The CATP adds that, in this context, the union asked for the matter to be referred to arbitration and that, although an  extra-procedural' meeting was held at which SUNAT submitted a document describing various measures taken on some of the demands included in the union s list as  SUNAT policy'  the union pointed out that these unilateral decisions could not be viewed as benefits obtained through collective bargaining, since they could be amended or revoked.\n.The Committee observes that the complainant highlights a previous case concerning SUNAT that involves the list of demands for ' , in which the Committee emphasized that the impossibility of negotiating wage increases on an ongoing basis is contrary to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. .\n.The Committee observes that the Government, as an indication of SUNAT s willingness to bargain, states that there have been collective agreements with two other union organizations operating at SUNAT, one of which is the National Federation of Customs and Taxation Workers; the Government emphasizes that arbitration with SUNAT is possible (the Government refers to an arbitration award in proceedings between SUNAT and the complainant) and that the complainant could have recourse to the same procedure for the list of demands for ' , by virtue of a  ministerial resolution, if there is a lack of good faith in bargaining, provided that the requirements set out in the resolution are met (completing a training course ' first organized in December  ' and being included on the National Register of Arbitrators). The Committee observes that the Government states that the  ministerial resolution, in accordance with legislation and the practice of the Constitutional Court, provides for the possibility of negotiating increases in remuneration within previously authorized budgetary allocations, so long as it is taken into account that any such financing must be planned using resources directly raised by the public body in question.\n.The Committee takes note of the Government s statements denying any lack of good faith on the part of SUNAT and pointing out that SUNAT had participated in bargaining meetings to try and reach agreement during the direct negotiation, conciliation and extra-procedural phases, and that records show that discussions took place between the parties in order to reach agreement as far as possible. The Committee takes note of the Government s statement that the fact that SUNAT s representatives were unable to review the extensive documentation submitted by the union, as reflected in the minutes of the conciliation meeting ( September ), cannot be taken as an indication of bad faith, as the information was only received on  and  September. The Committee observes that the Government recognizes certain restrictions on the negotiation of economic provisions for budgetary reasons, although it seems that the situation has subsequently evolved from a legal point of view.\n.The Committee concludes, based on the statements made by the complainant and the Government, that the representatives of SUNAT participated in all phases of the bargaining process concerning the list of demands for ' , that there was discussion between the parties and that the employer representatives made counter-proposals (although the complainant claims that they represented no real improvement). The Committee considers SUNAT s practice of granting certain improvements in conditions to public servants, not within the framework of a collective agreement, but as unilateral decisions, even though they relate to bargaining matters (which makes it more a consultation than bargaining), to be more problematic. The Committee observes, in this respect, that the Government confirms that, during the bargaining process, SUNAT indicated that, despite no agreement having been reached, nine demands (which the complainant recognizes were related to some union demands) had already been acknowledged and acted upon, as detailed in the Government s reply. In the Committee s view, this practice does not promote collective bargaining and should be avoided.\n.The Committee observes that, in this case, as in previous cases concerning Peru, bargaining on provisions that imply increases in remuneration has run into significant difficulties in practice, and also that the applicable standards require further clarification (for instance, the state grants general bonuses to its employees). The Committee observes that, in this case, the arbitration requested by the complainant with regard to the list of demands for '  did not take place and that the bargaining process extended beyond the period it was intended to cover (as can be seen, for example, from this case and from the Government s statements regarding the date of the arbitration award for the '  list of demands). The Committee observes that arbitration in public bodies is covered by a  ministerial resolution that allows for"", ""budget is to order and balance state expenditure, given that the resources are public and the product of the contributions made by all citizens and that different responsibilities entrusted to the State must be fulfilled.\n.The Committee notes that, as alleged by the complainant organizations and confirmed by the Government, the th final supplementary provision of the Public Sector Budget Act, No. , restricts collective bargaining and labour arbitration to working conditions only, and that section  of that Act prohibits the readjustment, increase or creation of any form of income for public sector workers through whatever mechanism. The Committee observes that, as indicated by the complainant organization, the FTLF, and confirmed by the Government, FONAFE must comply with Act No. , and that as a result, state electrical companies within FONAFE s sphere are unable to negotiate economic clauses. The Committee notes that the complainant organization, the FTLF, attached to its complaint copies of letters sent to FONAFE and to the electrical company, Electrocentro, SA, in which it requested that the th final supplementary provision of Act No.  should not be applied. As is clear from the attachments submitted by the complainant organization, in his reply the FONAFE Executive Director stated that Act No.  restricts collective bargaining and labour arbitration to working conditions only and emphasized that FONAFE must comply with the Act in question; for its part, the company Electrocentro, SA, stated that the Act was the responsibility of FONAFE and that it is not competent to deal with the request to revoke or contravene the content of the th final supplementary provision of Act No. .\n.The Committee wishes to emphasize that it has referred on various occasions to matters relating to collective bargaining in Peruvian legislation applicable to the public sector and that in the past few years it has made recommendations to the Government as part of complaints submitted by Peruvian trade union organizations, very similar to the present cases (Cases Nos  and ). The Committee recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to wage ceilings imposed by FONAFE in the wage scales of public electrical companies. The Committee reiterates its previous conclusions and once again recalls the principle, according to which  in so far as the income of public enterprises and bodies depends on state budgets, it would not be objectionable ' after wide discussion and consultation between the concerned employers' and employees' organizations in a system having the confidence of the parties ' for wage ceilings to be fixed in state budgetary laws' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee requested the Government on that occasion  to ensure that trade unions in the public enterprises are consulted when setting budget ceilings for public enterprises with regard to wages, so that the trade unions concerned may assess the situation, express their views and positions and discuss with the authorities the considerations of general interest that these authorities may deem it necessary to highlight' [see th Report, para. ].\n.The Committee also recalls that in Case No.  it already examined the allegation relating to Ministerial Resolution No. --TR which obliges the arbitrators of collective bargaining, which cover a state entity or company, to take into account the resources available in the public budget. The Committee notes that in its last reply the Government referred to the need for collective bargaining to take place within the state budgetary limits. The Committee reiterates its conclusion in Case No. , according to which  the requirement itself for arbitrators to take into account available resources in the public budget is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining'  and again requests the Government to ensure respect for its principles as regards salary restrictions in collective bargaining in the public sector [see Digest, op. cit., paras -] [see th Report, para. ].\n.Furthermore, as regards the civil service reform introduced by Act No. , the Committee notes that the reform applies to State workers at the three levels of government (national, regional and local), and that two draft regulations were issued together with the Act: regulations governing the general application of the Act and regulations covering the special system for local governments. Likewise, the Committee observes that, as is clear from the wording of the Act, staff covered by the old systems (workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (public careers), workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (system based on rules for the private sector) and workers governed by Decree-Law No.  (hired on administrative services contracts)) may be transferred, voluntarily and subject to a merit-based public competition, to the system provided for in the Act. Act No.  states that incorporation in the new system should take place gradually and that it will be finalized within a maximum period of six years.\n.As regards the allegations whereby the process of drafting the Civil Service Act No.  circumvented the mechanism for participation or consultation of workers' organizations, the Committee notes that the Government has not responded to this allegation and therefore recalls in general terms that it is essential that the introduction of draft legislation affecting collective bargaining or conditions of employment should be preceded by full and detailed consultations with the appropriate organizations of workers and employers [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. Consequently, the Committee firmly expects that in future the Government will guarantee that, in practice, the trade unions participate in the consultations on any question or proposed legislation which affects the rights of the workers it represents.\n.As to the allegations according to which Act No.  infringes the right to strike by allowing public entities to hire, temporarily and directly, the staff necessary to guarantee the provision of minimum services in essential services and in services vital for the entity to operate, from the beginning of the strike until its actual end, the Committee notes that the Government considers that this would not cause problems of compatibility with the ILO Conventions, provided that the requirements established in the Act are satisfied, that is, the services qualified as essential are determined according to the criteria of the ILO supervisory bodies, the minimum services are defined with the participation of workers' organizations, and replacement workers are hired only where the minimum services have not been covered by the organization or workers exercising their right to strike and this situation leads to a serious risk to human life, safety or health. In this regard, the Committee recalls the principle according to which the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited in the public service or in essential services in so far as a strike there could cause serious hardship to the national community and provided that the limitations are accompanied by certain compensatory guarantees [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].\n.As to the allegations that section  of Act No.  excludes public servants, public managers and trusted servants from collective rights, the Committee notes that the Government states that although no such exclusion exists in the strict sense of the term, a rule should be created which specifies the scope for the purposes of clearer interpretation. In this regard, the Committee recalls that Article () of Convention No.  states that the extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Convention shall apply to high-level employees whose functions are normally considered as policy-making or managerial, or to employees whose duties are of a highly confidential nature, shall be determined by national laws or regulations. The Committee recalls, however, that under Convention No. , ratified by Peru, the right of collective bargaining can be denied only to public servants working in the state administration.\n.As to the allegations that section  of Act No.  adds major difficulties to the negotiating process given that once the list has been submitted, approval must be obtained from the National Civil Service Authority (SERVIR) and from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the agreements reached between the representatives of the public entity and the civil servants are valid for a minimum of two years, the Committee notes that the Government stresses that the Committee on Freedom of Association has held that  the duration of collective agreements is primarily a matter for the partners involved'  In this regard, the Committee recalls firstly that budgetary opportunities within the negotiating framework may be verified and, secondly, recalls the principle according to which  a statutory provision providing that a collective agreement should be in force for two years when no other period has been agreed by the parties does not constitute a violation of the right to collective bargaining' [see Digest, op. cit. para. ]. Consequently, the Committee will not continue with the examination of these allegations.\n.In relation to the allegation by the complainant organizations that section  of Act No.  circumvents collective bargaining in all public entities to working conditions only, excluding subjects relating""]"

The FNTMMSP indicates that, on  July , SUTRACOMASA filed a complaint with the National Labour Inspection Authority (SUNAFIL) regarding these anti-union practices.\n.First, the FNTMMSP alleges that the mining company used press and radio (Radio Yanacancha, which is owned by the company) communications to cause damage to the honour, standing and reputation of SUTRACOMASA. The FNTMMSP attaches to its complaint a copy of the following communications, the alleged aim of which was to reduce membership of SUTRACOMASA and ultimately eliminate the union: (i) a communication dated  November , in which the company rejects the version of events recounted by SUTRACOMASA officials regarding an accident involving a trade unionist and underlines that this was the first incident to occur since  November, the date when a strike declared illegal by the labour authority began; (ii) a communication dated  November , in which the company blames SUTRACOMASA officials for blocking entry to the operations centre and threatening and verbally abusing workers who had decided not to comply with the stoppages; (iii) a communication No. , issued by the Vice-President for Human Resources, in which the company reiterates its desire for dialogue and states that calling a strike was unwarranted, given that not all avenues of negotiation between the parties had been exhausted; (iv) a communication dated  December , in which the General Secretary of SUTRACOMASA was directly discredited, claiming that he lies and makes inaccurate statements and that he had made groundless allegations, which the company had to refute; (v) a communication dated  January  which, purporting to clarify information provided by the trade union, implied that the trade union was spreading lies; and (vi) a communication dated  July , in which the company announced that the benefits provided for under a collective agreement will be granted regardless of whether or not workers were members of SUTRACOMASA, thereby encouraging members to resign from the trade union and precipitating its breakup. The FNTMMSP attaches to the complaint copies of letters of resignation submitted between November  and January  by almost  members of SUTRACOMASA. Lastly, regarding the radio communications, the FNTMMSP indicates that, despite the fact that SUTRACOMASA requested radio airtime in order to exercise its right to reply, those requests were rejected verbally, with no formal response to its request provided.\n.Second, the FNTMMSP alleges that the mining company violated the trade union immunity of Mr Edwin Farromeque Romero and Mr Henry Bruno Rojas, who were transferred from their workplaces without just cause, with the intention of breaking up SUTRACOMASA. With regard to Mr Farromeque Romero, the FNTMMSP reports that, on the date of his transfer, he was the sole applicant for the position of Assistant General Secretary at the Huarmey base, and the company had therefore violated article  of the Collective Labour Relations Act, which provides that  trade union immunity guarantees that certain workers may not be dismissed or transferred to other establishments within the same company, without clearly demonstrated just cause or without their consent. Worker consent is not required if the transfer will not prevent them from carrying out their trade union official duties'  which is complemented by article , which states that  trade union immunity is enjoyed by ' (d) candidates for trade union office or representation for thirty () calendar days prior to the election process and up to thirty () calendar days after the election process has been concluded' \n.In a communication dated  February , the Government transmits its observations, as well as the observations of the mining company. First, the Government indicates that the anti-union practices alleged in this complaint were reported on  July  by SUTRACOMASA to SUNAFIL, the body responsible for promoting, supervising and monitoring compliance with legislation on social, labour and occupational safety and health matters. In this regard, the Government states that, on  October , and having carried out the second and final inspection visit to the company, SUNAFIL prepared its report (attached by the Government) which concludes that it found no evidence of labour-related violations.\n.With regard to the transfer of the workers Mr Farromeque Romero and Mr Rojas, the Government states that they are currently working in their usual workplace at the concentrator plant located in the Port of Punta Lobitos (PPL) in the town of Huarmey. Moreover, the mining company claims that the transfer to the mine, which took place on  March , was not implemented with a view to affecting their right to freedom of association, but was a temporary measure duly justified given the existence of a training programme. As detailed by the company, it has a training programme for the  concentrator'  which meant that the workers in question were rotated so that they could undergo comprehensive training in the various duties involved in operating the plant. The Government attached a copy of the letters sent by the company to the workers on  September , in which it informed them that, as they had completed their six-month rotation period, they were to return to their previous positions on  October. The Government indicates that, as confirmed by SUNAFIL in its inspection report, Mr Farromeque Romero and Mr Rojas returned to their workplaces on  and  October  respectively.\n.The mining company refers in detail to the rotation-based training programme (cross training), which was initiated in , and the company also indicates the numbers of workers that participated in the programme in that year and those that were subject to rotation for a period of six months. As indicated by the company, the programme suffered delays for reasons beyond its control, but in January  it was ready to proceed with the rotation of workers who had still not taken part in the programme. In the specific case of workers at the PPL concentrator plant, four workers had yet to be rotated and, as two of these were not in a position to take up the rotation, the programme continued with the two remaining workers, Mr Farromeque Romero and Mr Rojas, who were aware of the programme and were informed early on about their rotation and the temporary nature of the transfer. The company emphasizes that, in Mr Farromeque Romero s case, his temporary transfer at no time prevented him from carrying out his duties in SUTRACOMASA, as he was granted leave for trade union activities during that period. In its report of  October , SUNAFIL concludes that, given that Mr Farromeque Romero and Mr Rojas returned to their workplaces on  and  October respectively, it was unable to continue with the investigation.\n.Concerning the press and radio communications issued by the company, the mining company states that they were simply for information purposes and were disseminated in November and December , during periods in which SUTRACOMASA called for, and encouraged its members to take part in, two strikes that were declared unlawful because of the failure to provide a list of the names of workers who would cover essential posts during the stoppages. In addition, the company states that the communications were limited to clarifying the company s position on the false and inaccurate allegations made during the stoppages and that, from reading those communications, there is no evidence of any references or statements being made that might impede the free exercise of the right to freedom of association or even harm the good image of the trade union organization.\n.With regard to the failure to grant radio airtime to SUTRACOMASA, the mining company states that the Yanacancha radio station was founded in  by the Yanacancha Civil Association, in order to provide an opportunity to share information with the workers. The Yanacancha association hired Prodial Comunicacin Integral PLC (hereinafter  PCI'  to manage and operate the radio station. Concerning the request from SUTRACOMASA to have  minutes of airtime twice a day to broadcast trade union information, the company claims that it had no legal obligation to grant airtime on a private radio station, whose purpose was to create a channel of communication between the company and its workers, in particular given that"", 'June , the Unified Trade Union of Petroleum, Energy, Oil and Refinery Workers of the Grau Region (SUTPEDARG) alleges that its member, Mr. Jos Fernndez Guzmn, was sanctioned by a two-day suspension without pay by the administration of ""Petrleos del Per"" for having taken part in the strike declared by several trade unions on  April , which called for the Government to rectify its economic policy, including the demand for free collective bargaining. The complainant organization attaches the letter of dismissal in which the aforementioned member is admonished for having taken part in the strike whereas his post was considered essential for the upholding and continuity of minimum services and he had put the refinery\'s activities at grave risk.\n.In its letters of  April and  June , the Federation of Petroleum Workers of Peru (FETRAPEP) alleges that the trade unions of the state enterprise Petrleos del Per (PETROPER), after several months of negotiations during which the workers resisted the enterprise\'s proposal (award of a Single Productivity Bonus with acceptance of the consolidation of existing working conditions in a consolidated bonus on the basis of Emergency Decree No. -), entered into a conciliation procedure presided over by the Ministry of Labour with the parties agreeing to take the collective bargaining to arbitration. FETRAPEP adds that the arbitration award was based on the workers\' proposal, inasmuch as it set a wage increase and threw out the enterprise\'s proposal. Nevertheless, the enterprise challenged the arbitration award before the Labour Chamber of the High Court of Justice of Lima, invoking Emergency Decree No. -. The Labour Chamber decided, as a precaution, to put the award in abeyance. The complainant adds that on  February , the Government extended Emergency Decree No. - by Emergency Decree No. -. FETRAPEP points out that the Lawyers\' College of Lima questioned the constitutionality of Emergency Decree No. - before the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal.\n.In its communication of  June , the CGTP also alleges that Emergency Decree No. - extends the application of Emergency Decree No. - beyond the year  and restricts collective bargaining in the public sector.\n.In its communications of  February,  April and  September , the Government states that Emergency Decree No. -, published on  March , was issued in keeping with article () of the Political Constitution of Peru. That constitutional text empowers the President of the Republic to issue extraordinary measures, in the form of emergency decrees with the force of law, when the national interest so requires and she/he is called upon to report to Congress; these emergency decrees constitute extraordinary measures that the President may issue in respect of economic or financial matters as required by the country\'s circumstances. The emergency decree in question awarded a ""special bonus"" to public administration workers within the framework of the law on administrative careers and public sector remuneration (Legislative Decree No. ). In article  of the same text, there is indication that the bodies covered by article  of the  Public Sector Budget Act (No. ), i.e. the state-run enterprises and all enterprises in which the State has a majority holding, will conduct their pay policy for  through the award of a Single Productivity Bonus which will not be part of basic remuneration and will be determined by resolution of the Ministry of Economics and Finance.\n.The Government goes on to say that Ministerial Resolution No. --EF/ was published on  April , which confirmed the award of the aforementioned bonus as well as the streamlining of the remuneration system for workers in state enterprises. The requirements established in the text for the award of the Single Productivity Bonus are:(a) the amount shall be established with account being taken of the worker\'s level of responsibility, contribution and commitment, as reflected in an evaluation process. The criteria for this evaluation shall be set by the director, directorate or board of the relevant enterprise;(b) the resulting amount may be paid in instalments;(c) the remuneration system shall already have been simplified by restructuring, although without any variation in staff income. Similarly, the system\'s simplification should be agreed to in the course of collective bargaining;(d) in the case of staff covered by collective bargaining, the bonus will be awarded within the collective bargaining process;(e) the total amount of worker remuneration, including the bonus, will not exceed the maximum annual income established for the general manager or equivalent official in the relevant body.\n.The Government believes that none of these requirements violates any constitutional provision; moreover, the Ministerial Resolution does not stipulate that collective agreements must be approved by the OIOE but states that the internal control offices of the respective enterprises shall supply the OIOE with a report containing details of the remuneration received by the workers in the sector. Similarly, it points out that the directors, directorate or boards shall provide the OIOE with the  budget evaluation. The sole instance of prior approval required by the OIOE applies to an official receiving remuneration higher than that of the general manager or equivalent official. In that case, if it were decided to maintain that level of remuneration, the grounds for it being upheld should be submitted to the OIOE for approval. However, that is unrelated to the approval of the collective agreement.\n.The Government stresses that: () the legal machinery for the issue of Emergency Decree No. - and Ministerial Resolution No. --EF/ were respected; they are constitutional and in keeping with the standards applicable to public sector and state enterprise workers; () the procedures applicable to the award of the Single Productivity Bonus are an integral part of the collective bargaining and, in this way, are in compliance with the provisions of the Constitution and relevant international conventions; and () the Ministerial Resolution does not make the applicability of collective agreements contingent upon OIOE approval.\n.With regard to the limitation applicable to remuneration above the maximum annual income for the general manager or equivalent official in the relevant sector, there are precedents (and the Government supplies examples) in which, by collective agreement and arbitration award, the remuneration established by the OIOE has been exceeded. Similarly, it should be emphasized that the rights recognized by collective agreement or arbitration award take precedence over any other text, maintaining the agreement\'s effective application and independence.\n.Furthermore, the streamlining of the remuneration system addressed by Ministerial Resolution No. --EF/ does not imply any variation in staff income and there is no wage freeze or elimination of other rights, in view of the fact that the simplification involves restructuring of the components but no change to income levels. As concerns the allegations of FETRAPEP, the Government states that the order of the High Court may be appealed in accordance with the legislation in force and that, according to the same complainant, the High Court decided in its favour.\n.With regard to the allegation that Mr. Jos Fernndez Guzmn, a SUTPEDARG member, was suspended for two days without pay for having taken part in the strike called in ""Petrleos del Per"", the Government states that this was on account of his failure to report for work on  April  despite the fact that the trade union and the said worker had been notified that he was part of essential staff. In this regard, the right to strike is recognized in the Collective Industrial Relations Act, but that text stipulates in article  that: ""Whenever the strike affects essential public services, or in the instance addressed by article , the workers engaged in the dispute shall guarantee the availability of essential staff for the purpose of preventing a total stoppage and for securing the continuity of the necessary activity (...).""\n.With regard to the allegations concerning ENAFER S.A., the Government explains in detail the legal procedures applied under the Promotion of Private Investment in State Enterprises Act up to and including the publication of Supreme Decree No. --TR on  September , authorizing the directorate of ENAFER S.A. to implement the staff rationalization programme approved by the Private Investment Promotion Commission (COPRI) at its meeting of  October . The Government goes on to say that ENAFER S.A. carried out a staff rationalization programme on account of the company\'s unsound economic and financial situation necessitating administrative reorganization. The ENAFER S.A. directorate, in Agreement No.  of Session No. /, authorized the administration to take all necessary action for the due application of the aforementioned Decree. Having authorized the said Agreement\'s implementation as of  January , the application for staff reductions was presented to the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection which issued Order No. --DRTPSL-DPSC-SDNC for the withdrawal of all of the company\'s workers; this was done in compliance with article  and following Legislative Decree No.  ""Labour Productivity and Competitivity Act"", with no appeal being lodged. It should be pointed out that, by public auction on  July , the Railway Consortium of Peru was granted the operating licence for ENAFER S.A. assets. This transfer involved the recruitment by', 'facts, determining responsibility and punishing those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) The Committee requests the Government to repeal Emergency Decree No. -, Ministerial Resolution No. --EF/ and Emergency Decree No. - so as to guarantee that the parties themselves decide whether they wish to include productivity criteria in determining wages in collective bargaining.\n.The complaints are contained in communications from the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) and the Unified Trade Union of Petroleum, Energy, Oil and Refinery Workers of the Grau Region (SUTPEDARG), dated  August and  June  respectively, and in a communication from the Federation of Petroleum Workers of Peru (FETRAPEP), dated  April . The CGTP forwarded fresh allegations by letters of  August  and  June , and the FETRAPEP in a communication of  June . The Government responded by letter of  February,  April and  September .\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  August , the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) alleges that article  of Emergency Decree No. -, published on  March , established that, in , state enterprises would conduct their pay policy for staff, whether covered by collective bargaining or not, through the award of a single productivity bonus which would not constitute a part of their basic remuneration and would be governed by resolution of the Ministry of Economics and Finance. In accordance with the aforementioned article, Ministerial Resolution No. --EF was published on  April ; this set the guidelines for the award of the Single Productivity Bonus (BUP), as well as the guidelines for simplifying the pay system of workers in state enterprises. The requirements established by the resolution for the award of the bonus in state enterprises were as follows: (a) the amount to be awarded should be set in accordance with the worker\'s level of responsibility, contribution and commitment, as reflected in an evaluation process conducted prior to the award; the evaluation criteria may be approved solely by the directorate, i.e. without the involvement of the trade union; (b) the resulting amount may be paid in instalments; (c) prior to this, the pay system must have been simplified on the basis of only two structural components (basic remuneration and consolidated bonus) and the integral remuneration agreements must have been signed in cases where remuneration exceeds , nuevo sols; (d) in the case of staff covered by collective bargaining, bonuses must be set and awarded as part of the collective bargaining process; and (e) a worker\'s total present income plus bonus (which as such may not be considered as a pay increase) may under no circumstances exceed the Maximum Income Level (TMI) established for the general manager or equivalent official in each enterprise. Similarly, the award of the BUP will depend in the last instance upon the extent to which the management objectives have been achieved, as set out in the management agreement concluded between the state enterprise and the Office of State Institutions and Bodies (OIOE), as stipulated by articles  and  of the aforementioned Ministerial Resolution. Those agreements specifically state the enterprise\'s commitments and the productivity bonus entitlement, provided that a high percentage of the planned objectives for  are achieved, failing which, no authorization will be issued to make bonus payments subject to the limits set in the agreement.\n.Furthermore, in accordance with the regulations applicable to collective bargaining, as cited by the CGTP, the directorates of state enterprises must submit to the OIOE, for its approval, the agreements signed with trade unions; this is required by Act No. , the Public Sector Budget Act; this constitutes a further encroachment upon the parties\' collective independence, above and beyond the constraints imposed by that instrument.\n.According to the CGTP, the strategy of placing the productivity bonus award exercise within the collective bargaining process is part of a policy gradually to replace the increases or compensation agreed upon with the workers. This constitutes an attempt to obviate the bargaining phase which, at present, addresses increases in remuneration, with implications in terms of compensation for service time, allowances, leave and others, in an endeavour to move on to the stage of regulating non-remuneration-related increases without any positive implications for workers\' rights and, apparently, without any extra labour costs for enterprises and with a further reduction in the Peruvian workers\' standard of living.\n.Accordingly, organizations such as the Federation of National Ports Enterprise Workers (FENTENAPU) and the Union of SEDEPAL Workers (SUTESAL) were coerced into signing their collective agreements with the respective state enterprises under the conditions imposed by the aforementioned instructions which, hence, limit the agreements regarding wage increases and, in particular, remuneration-related increases for the benefit of their members.\n.Furthermore, the members of the National Unified Federation of Health Workers (FENUTSSA) received a clear refusal from the Ministry of Health to negotiate upon the list of claims they presented this year, with the argument that, this year, the education sector required extra finances for the purpose of increasing the pay of administrative staff in various regions of the country. Similarly, the list of claims presented to the Ministry of Education by the United Education Trade Union of Peru (SUTEP), the Unified Trade Union of Education Centre Workers (SUTACE) and the National Federation of Education Administrative Workers (FENTASE) was disregarded upon grounds similar to those invoked in the health sector. All of this occurred despite the fact that salaries of public servants in health and education have been frozen for several years.\n.In its communication dated  August , the CGTP alleges that on  July  the Government handed over the railways of the state enterprise ENAFER S.A. to a consortium of private companies with domestic and foreign capital. This meant the dismissal of all workers already having undergone three staff rationalization operations involving more than , lay-offs since . The dismissals constitute a case of abuse by the Government, given that a technical study by the World Bank indicates that the staff necessary for the enterprise to function is , workers. The new operator is only required to recruit former ENAFER S.A. workers to meet its own needs; the recruitment is for one year and may be carried out directly or through third parties. In this way, the majority of the , workers will lose their jobs whereas they are above  years of age and, also, the majority of those that manage to be recruited will be so by third parties. The CGTP points out that the offers made to the trade unions by ENAFER S.A. to bring about their acceptance of the terminations was to pay compensation to the tune of  nuevo sols (less than US$) in respect of each year of service - which is equivalent to the present basic wage of an ENAFER S.A. worker with  to  years of service. This remuneration is lower than the minimum remuneration for the purpose of calculating compensation, which is currently set at  nuevo sols per year of service and an indemnity of $,. The enterprise\'s proposals were turned down.\n.The railway union representatives made a counter-proposal: recruitment guarantees for a minimum of five years; an increase in basic remuneration comprising  nuevo sols of basic wage, an ""economic package"" of  nuevo sols per month that had already been paid; a compensatory bonus of $,, etc. This counter-proposal was rejected and ENAFER S.A. sent out notarial letters to each of the , workers. These letters invited them to accept its proposal, setting a deadline of  August  for the return of the signed letters, failing which they were threatened with termination as part of a collective dismissal already accepted by the Ministry of Labour, with the loss of the $, indemnity and with not being included in the list of workers to be supplied to the new operator for recruitment purposes. The CGTP adds that, in these circumstances, it was agreed to call a strike on  August . On  August, the Government initiated indiscriminate, unjustified and brutal repression of railway workers, their spouses and children camping out around the railway stations of Chosica (Lima), Cuzco and Arequipa. This violent repression left many people injured with contusions and instances of asphyxia, above all amongst the children and women on account of the large quantity of tear gas used by the police. In Cuzco,  workers were detained. On  August, there was industrial action in Lima, organized jointly by the telephone- and dockworkers\' unions, as well as in Arequipa and Chosica to protest at the police repression. Meetings were held with the chairpersons of the National Congress Labour and Transport Committees as well as with the Deputy Minister of Transport although, to date, the Government\'s position has remained unchanged and it has declared the strike illegal.\n.In its communication of ']"

In the Committee\'s opinion, the limit of  days\' leave per calendar year envisaged in section  should not limit the right of workers\' and employers\' organizations to establish a longer period through collective agreements, should they so wish. It would therefore be appropriate for the legislation to provide for such a possibility. . As regards the allegations which refer, on the one hand, to section (c), which provides that collective labour agreements shall remain in force for at least one year, and, on the other hand, to section , which stipulates that a prerequisite for the conclusion of a collective agreement on the branch or occupational level shall be a majority in terms both of the number of workers and of enterprises, the Committee recalls that the legislation should permit the employers\' and workers\' organizations to engage in collective bargaining without hindrance, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , and that these limitations are liable to make it very difficult to engage in collective bargaining at this level. The Committee accordingly requests the Government, in consultation with the social partners, to ensure that the legislation is modified in the light of the foregoing considerations.\n.As regards the allegations concerning the right to information and freedom of opinion in relation to collective bargaining and the punishments that apply in the event of disclosure (section  of the Legislative Decree and section  of Act No. ), the Committee considers that the punishment by dismissal that is envisaged (section  of Act No. ), in the event that trade union representatives communicate to third parties information they have acquired in the course of the collective bargaining process where that disclosure is liable to damage the enterprise, is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association.\n.As regards the allegation concerning the obligation to renegotiate collective agreements currently in force and the violation of the principle of collective autonomy (fourth transitional provision, sections (d), ,  and  of the Legislative Decree, and section  of the regulations corresponding to that Decree), the Committee observes that the fourth transitional provision provides that the first round of collective bargaining giving rise to an agreement, award or decision that becomes valid with the coming into force of this Legislative Decree shall include the complete revision of all agreements on working conditions and remuneration that are currently in force. In the absence of an agreement, the matter will proceed in accordance with the rules established by the present Legislative Decree"". In addition, section (d) provides that a collective agreement ""automatically lapses upon its expiry, except where a permanent agreement has been reached or where the parties expressly agree upon its entire or partial renewal or extension"". Likewise, section  of the regulations made under the Legislative Decree provides that ""the lapsing referred to in section (d) of the Legislative Decree shall apply to collective agreements signed prior to the entry into force of the Legislative Decree if, as a result of the revision carried out pursuant to the fourth and final transitional provision of the Legislative Decree, that lapsing is agreed to by the parties or provided for by the arbitral decision without prejudice to the provisions laid down in the second paragraph of section  of the Legislative Decree"". That provision establishes that the employer may propose clauses which are new or which replace those contained in previous agreements. As regards the aforementioned provisions, the Committee is of the view that legislation which obliges the parties to renegotiate acquired trade union rights is contrary to the principles of collective bargaining. In this respect, the Committee requests that the necessary steps be taken to allow workers\' organizations to negotiate conditions of employment freely with the employer.\n.As regards the allegation to the effect that recourse to arbitration excludes the exercise of the right to strike (sections ,  and ), the Committee observes that, so far as can be ascertained from an analysis of the relevant sections (see annexed text), workers may opt either for arbitration or for strike action; in these circumstances, the Committee considers that such provisions do not violate the principles of freedom of association.\n.As regards the allegation concerning compulsory arbitration in essential public services (sections  and ), the Committee observes that, under section , any dispute in essential public services which cannot be settled either by direct negotiation or conciliation shall be submitted to compulsory arbitration by a tripartite tribunal. The Committee also observes that the list of essential public services in section  is too long and includes services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) (see Digest, rd edition, , para. ). Specifically, the Committee considers that subsection (j), which refers to essential public services as being those whose interruption would create a serious and imminent risk for individuals or property, could, given its vagueness, be interpreted in such a way as to limit seriously the right to strike, and should therefore be deleted from section  of the Legislative Decree.\n.As regards the allegation concerning section , which empowers the public authorities to intervene and to order an immediate return to work in the event that a strike goes on for so long as to jeopardize an enterprise or productive sector seriously, or takes on alarming proportions, the Committee has on previous occasions stated that ""it would appear legitimate that a minimum service be maintained in the event of a strike the extent and duration of which might be such as to result in an acute national crisis endangering the normal living conditions of the population. Such a minimum service should be confined to operations that are strictly necessary to avoid endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population; in addition, workers\' organizations should be able to participate in defining such a service in the same way as employers and the public authorities"" (see Digest, rd edition, , para. ). In this regard, the Committee is of the view that the legislation should not hinder the full exercise of the right to strike and that, in such circumstances, it would be possible to establish a minimum service, taking the above considerations into account.\n.As regards the allegations concerning sections  and , which state that the Legislative Decree does not protect irregular forms of action, such as the sudden halting of operations, go-slow strikes, working to rule, etc., the Committee considers that these restrictions may be justified only if the strike ceases to be peaceful (see Digest, rd edition, , para. ).\n.As regards the allegation concerning section , which requires that a minimum service be maintained in the event of a strike in essential public services (as defined in section ), and that any disagreement as to the number and duties of the workers concerned shall be settled by the labour authority, the Committee is of the opinion that the legislation should provide for any such disagreement to be settled by an independent body.\n.As regards the allegation concerning the conditions to be fulfilled before a strike may be declared (section (a) and (b)), the Committee observes that, under subsection (a), in order for a strike to be declared it must have as its objective the defence of the occupational rights and interests of the workers. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that ""the occupational and economic interests which workers defend through the exercise of the right to strike do not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social policy questions and problems facing the undertaking which are of direct concern to the workers"" (see Digest, rd edition, , para. ). As regards section (b), which requires a decision by over half of all the workers involved in order to declare a strike, the Committee is of the opinion that such a requirement is excessive and could excessively hinder the possibility of carrying out a strike, particularly in large undertakings. The Committee calls on the Government to take the necessary steps to modify accordingly section (a) and (b) prescribing the conditions to be fulfilled before a strike may be declared.\n.As regards the allegations concerning the validity of certain statutory provisions which have entered into force since  and are inconsistent with Conventions Nos.  and ,', 'number of trade union representatives covered by trade union immunity is within reasonable limits, but that the possibility should exist to establish a higher number, through collective bargaining.\n.As regards the allegation concerning the imposition of a limit on the leave granted to trade union leaders (section ), the Committee observes that the first paragraph of that section provides that the collective agreement shall contain provisions aimed at facilitating trade union activities, and that the final paragraph limits such leave periods to  days per calendar year.

Moreover, these contracts can be renewed at will and without any limit by employers in public bodies and, according to the complainant organizations, the renewal of contracts is subject to the condition that the workers do not establish or join trade unions. In practice, no trade union organizations for workers covered by the CAS system are registered with the Ministry.\n.Undeclared workers. The complainant organizations add that a high percentage of the wage-earning population provide services without enjoying the protection afforded by the labour legislation. According to the data of the Ministry of Labour, in , . per cent of wage earners did not have any type of employment contract. Indeed, the smaller the size of the enterprise unit, the higher the percentage of undeclared workers. The complainant organizations emphasize that there are also high rates of undeclared workers in larger enterprises operating in the formal economy. The lack of political will by the State to enforce the declaration of workers is having a direct impact on the possibility of exercising the right to freedom of association.Workers who, despite the recognition of their right to organize and collective bargaining, are limited in the exercise of these rights in practice\n.Workers with temporary contracts. The complainant organizations indicate that the legislation that is in force encourages the use of temporary contracts. They emphasize the drastic fall in the unionization rate corresponding to the unparalleled increase in temporary contracts, which shows that temporary workers are in a particularly vulnerable situation with regard to anti-union discrimination. In light of this special vulnerability, in the opinion of the complainant organizations, special and reinforced protection should be provided to ensure the effective observance of the right to freedom of association.\n.Workers subject to outsourcing and employment intermediation. The complainant organizations indicate that the main effect of outsourcing and employment intermediation in a context of trade union organization at the enterprise level promoted by the law is the fragmentation of production units and the reduction in the number of potential members of enterprise unions, as well as the decline in the coverage of collective bargaining. The complainant organizations add that the law provides that where there is no previous bargaining, in the absence of agreement between the parties on the bargaining level, it shall take place at the enterprise level. Furthermore, if there has already been previous bargaining at the enterprise level, the level at which bargaining takes place cannot be changed without the agreement of the parties. Accordingly, although workers are formally able to negotiate at the enterprise level, such bargaining is not effective as it does not enable workers to enjoy real participation in decisions affecting their terms and conditions of employment.\n.State workers without participation in the determination of their terms and conditions of employment. Finally, the complainant organizations indicate that, in the case of State workers covered by the public careers system and by the labour rules governing the private sector, even where their right to establish unions is recognized, their possibilities of engaging in collective bargaining are restricted by various means. The rules applicable to State workers governed by the public careers system formerly envisaged a consultation procedure for the formulation of draft changes to the single remuneration system in the public administration. However, the provisions establishing this participation machinery were repealed, as a result of which trade union organizations do not have any mechanism through which they can participate in the determination of remuneration conditions. Nor is it possible to negotiate conditions of work which do not imply additional budgetary allocations.\n.Moreover, although the Government frequently indicates that the General Labour Bill is currently being examined and that it will take into account the observations made by the ILO supervisory bodies, in reality approval of the Bill is not being promoted, despite the support of  per cent of the social partners in a social dialogue process. The General Labour Bill has been among the draft legislations due to be examined by Parliament for over four legislatures, without it actually being included on the agenda of the sessions of the Congress.\n.In its communication dated  February , the Government indicates that, with a view to promoting freedom of association, the following action has been taken through the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion:' on  February , the Office for Consultations with Trade Unions was established with the following functions: (i) to provide legal guidance on collective rights and administrative procedures of interest to them; and (ii) to offer formats and models for by-laws. During the period from February to December , consultations were held with trade unions on  occasions;' on  February , a new system was established for the registration of trade union organizations which reduced the processing time from a maximum of three days to three hours from the application being lodged by the officers of the parties to the automatic registration certificate being issued;' during the period from July  to December , a total of  trade unions were registered by the Trade Union Registry Division;' monthly meetings have been held with the most representative trade union confederations, federations and unions in the country to address their labour-related problems and resolve them immediately, thereby maintaining industrial peace;' similarly, the claims made by workers' and employers' organizations are duly addressed in the National Labour and Employment Promotion Council (CNTPE), which is the natural forum for dialogue on social and labour issues, as it is the tripartite advisory body of the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion.\n.The Government adds that four interpretation criteria have been published for application by officials of the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion and regional governments with a view to: (i) guaranteeing collective bargaining in any private labour relationship, including where the State is the employer and the trade union represents workers in public employment; (ii) respecting the trade union independence set forth in the rules of trade union organizations, thereby contributing to consolidating trade union organization; (iii) promoting collective bargaining, and allowing the possibility of delegating the representation of trade unions to those that they freely and explicitly select to engage in collective bargaining on their behalf; and (iv) guaranteeing the establishment and registration of trade unions.\n.The Government adds that other mechanisms have been introduced: (i) an early warning system for collective disputes at the national level, with a view to addressing, preventing and resolving such disputes in due time; and (ii) an alternative  non-regulated' dispute settlement mechanism known as  extra-procedural meetings'  This mechanism constitutes an additional effort to find an agreed solution to the dispute. It is a mechanism that is designed more to achieve solutions of equity and labour harmony than the strict application of the law; (iii) the General Directorate of Fundamental Rights at Work and Occupational Safety and Health, which is responsible for formulating public policies and developing action to promote fundamental rights at work, including freedom of association and collective bargaining; and (iv) dispute settlement machinery has been promoted and consolidated through conciliation and extra-procedural settlements, based on the training of the responsible officials and the development of basic guidelines for action.Lack of recognition of the right to organize in law and practice\n.Workers in micro-enterprises. The Government indicates that Legislative Decree No.  recognizes in section  the right of workers to establish trade unions and non-interference with the right of workers to choose and join, or not, legally established organizations. Accordingly, all workers covered by these provisions enjoy the explicit right to organize, in accordance with the Single Codified Text of the Act on collective labour relations and its corresponding regulations. The Government adds that it is not valid to argue that the number of workers in this type of enterprise is a limiting factor on the exercise of the right to organize, as the legislation provides that enterprises in which the number of workers is below that required to establish a union may select two delegates to the employer and to the labour authorities.\n.Workers covered by training arrangements. The Government explains that vocational training arrangements are special types of agreements combining theoretical and practical learning through the performance of planned activities of capacity building and vocational training. In accordance with the special rules respecting training arrangements, any of five types of agreements for such arrangements may be concluded, each for a specific duration. The parties are under the obligation to comply with the specific requirements set out in each of the arrangements, as is the case for the corresponding plans and programmes for each type of vocational training. The Government emphasizes that these agreements are not subject to the labour legislation in force, but to specific provisions respecting vocational promotion and training, which remains the case provided that such arrangements do not constitute an employment relationship. Finally, the Government indicates that training arrangements do not give rise to labour-related""]"

Both were working at the branch of the bank in Pucallpa, a city in eastern Peru. An error made in a banking operation, for which Mr Afocx was penalized by the bank at the time, was cited by the bank as the grounds for the workers' dismissal. The CGTP explains that the BBVA Banco Continental Federated Union of Employees, through its members at the Pucallpa branch, especially union official Mr Luis Afocx, who was also the union delegate at the branch, carried out checks at the Pucallpa branch to ensure that the workers were not subjected to abusive practices. For example, at the union leader s request, the Ministry of Labour conducted a number of inspections at the bank, resulting in the imposition of two fines: one on  November  (, nuevos soles) for obstruction of an inspection, the other on  November  (, nuevos soles) for failure to produce the workers' attendance register. The above situation involves a clear act of reprisal against union leader Mr Luis Afocx and union member Mr Rafael Saavedra Marina, and this constitutes a violation of freedom of association.\n.In its communication dated  November , the CGTP alleges that the social assistance secretary of the Agroindustrias San Jacinto SA Single Union of Workers was dismissed by the Agroindustrias San Jacinto SA company on a charge of serious misconduct which was not proven. In view of this violation, the worker appealed to the judicial authority on  January , applying to the El Santa High Court Labour Division (file No. ----JR-LA-) to have the dismissal overturned and to be reinstated in his post. Decision No.  of  September  finally declared the application to be well founded and ordered the respondent to reinstate the worker in his regular post and pay his outstanding wages. The company appealed against the Labour Division ruling and consequently the worker has not yet been reinstated.\n.In its communications of  and  May and  September , the Government states that, with regard to the allegations relating to the SINPOL, the employer and the most representative employers' organizations were notified in order to obtain their comments.\n.The Government states that the following replies have been received:- by means of a communication dated  January , the administrative director of the FAP educational centres states that all workers employed at FAP educational institutions have been recruited by the Peruvian Air Force as civilian employees and not by the FAP educational institutions in which they work, so the Ministry of Defence should be asked for its comments with regard to the present complaint- by a communication dated  January  the general manager of the National Association of Industry states that he has no knowledge of the administrative or judicial situation of the Manuel Polo Jimnez FAP school since the school does not form part of Peruvian private industry.\n.Nevertheless, the Government states that the Labour Inspection Directorate carried out inspections at the Manuel Polo Jimnez FAP school and, by means of report\n.The Government adds that as a result of these irregularities the Collective Bargaining Subdirectorate issued Subdirectorate Order No. --MTPE//. on  November , confirmed by the Dispute Prevention and Settlement Directorate via Directorate Order No. --MTPE//. of  February , imposing a fine of ,. nuevos soles, which has currently been referred to the Fines Control Unit for enforcement of the payment.\n.The Government states that, owing to the inspected educational institution s failure to issue payslips as required, to effect the due payments for May  to May  with the corresponding payment records, to pay bonuses from July  to December  and to allow the full exercise of trade union rights, the labour authority issued certificate of infringement No. - for a total fine of , nuevos soles.\n.With regard to the registration of SINPOL, the Manuel Polo Jimnez FAP school stated, by means of document No. -, that judicial proceedings concerning the validity of the registration of the union were in progress in Labour Court No. .\n.The Committee observes that the present case refers to allegations presented by the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP), namely: () the Manuel Polo Jimnez FAP school applied for the dissolution of the SINPOL; refuses to engage in collective bargaining with the union or operate the payroll check-off facility for the union; and dismissed the union s general secretary, Ms Nelly Palomino Pacchioni; () the RELAPASA dismissed Mr Pedro Germn Murgueytio Vsquez, former general secretary of the Refinera La Pampilla SA Single Union of Workers and current general secretary of the FENUPETROL; () the BBVA Banco Continental bank dismissed the external secretary of the BBVA Banco Continental Federated Union of Employees, Mr Luis Afocx Romo, and a union member, Mr Rafael Saavedra Marina; () the Agroindustrias San Jacinto SA company dismissed the social assistance secretary of the Agroindustrias San Jacinto SA Single Union of Workers and although the judicial authority ordered the worker s reinstatement, the order was not implemented because of an appeal lodged by the company.\n.The Committee notes the following points from the CGTP s allegations against the Manuel Polo Jimnez FAP school:- The school considers that it is subject to the public employment regime and that its relationship with the employees is of a civilian nature. Consequently it refuses to recognize the union and does not comply with the obligation to apply the check-off facility for union dues.- The union reported the situation to the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion, which confirmed the non-compliance in question.- The employer filed an application for the dissolution of the union with Lima Labour Court No. .- The union presented a list of demands in order to start the collective bargaining process but the employer refused to engage in collective bargaining and lodged an appeal with the Ministry of Labour. The appeal was declared inadmissible and the employer was instructed to convene the negotiation board. However, no bargaining process has been initiated to date.- The SINPOL general secretary was dismissed on  October  for alleged serious misconduct. In addition, the general secretary has been the subject of intimidation and slander by the authorities of the educational institution since her appointment as general secretary.\n.The Committee notes the Government s statement in this regard that the employer and the most representative employers' organizations were notified so that their views could be obtained and that according to them the Manuel Polo Jimnez FAP school does not form part of Peruvian private industry but comes under the Ministry of Defence.\n.The Committee notes that the Labour Inspection Directorate nevertheless conducted inspections at the Manuel Polo Jimnez FAP school and concluded that, according to the principle of the precedence of actual conditions, the workers are affiliated to the private employment regime, a circumstance which the employer indicated on the workers' pay slips until March  but subsequently omitted. It was also noted that the obligation to deposit union dues and pay certain benefits was not met and that the workers were prevented from fully exercising their union rights. Because of this non-compliance, the institution was fined , nuevos soles. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Subdirectorate imposed a fine of ,. nuevos soles. The Committee notes the Government s additional statement that, as regards the registration of SINPOL, judicial proceedings are in progress in Labour Court No. .\n.The Committee observes that the Government has not sent its observations with respect to the acts of intimidation and slander against SINPOL general secretary Ms Nelly Palomino Pacchioni and her subsequent dismissal on  October . The Committee expresses its concern at the judicial application for the dissolution of the union and at the dismissal of the union leader, which appears to be an act of reprisal further to the establishment of the union. The Committee requests the Government to launch an investigation into this dismissal without delay and, if the dismissal proves to have been on anti-union grounds, to take steps to ensure that the union leader is reinstated in her post without delay and her outstanding wages are paid. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to inform it of the final outcome of the judicial application for the dissolution of SINPOL in progress in Labour Court No. .\n.The Committee observes that the Government has not"", "".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns alleged acts of anti-union discrimination and persecution in the National Public Records Office, at its October  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the result of the appeal filed by Mr Agustn Hermes Mendoza Champion (Mr Mendoza) against decision No.  of , handed down at first instance, which partially upheld his appeal for amparo (remedy for the protection of constitutional rights) and, consequently, declared the administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted to be null and void.\n.In this respect, the Committee takes note that, in communications dated  November  and  August , the Government indicates that the appeal for amparo (File No. -) lodged by Mr Mendoza challenging the validity of the administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted against him was rejected in the last instance in . On that occasion, the Constitutional Court declared inadmissible the appeal for amparo lodged by Mr Mendoza against decision No.  of , handed down at second instance, which declared the request to be unfounded, thus revoking decision No.  of , handed down at first instance, which had partially upheld the request.\n.Furthermore, since the last examination of the case and to date, the Committee has not received any information from the complainant organization, the Autonomous Confederation of Peruvian Workers. In these circumstances, and taking due note of the information provided by the Government, the Committee considers this case closed and will not pursue its examination.\n.At its October  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the issues that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome: () of the appeals filed by trade union official Mr Agustn Mendoza Champion, Culture and Training Secretary of the Trade Union of Registry Zone IX, Ica Zone, against the penalties of suspension imposed on him; and () of the appeal filed by Mr Holgun Nacarino, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Registry Zone V of Trujillo, against the administrative decision penalizing him, as well as on the outcome of the pending administrative disciplinary proceedings against him.\n.In its communication dated  February , the Government states the following with regard to the appeals filed by Mr Agustn Hermes Mendoza Champion: () through decision No. --SERVIR/TSC, of  May , the Civil Service Tribunal dismissed an appeal by the trade union official against a penalty of  days' suspension without pay imposed in June  for failing to obey the order to cease trade union activities; () through decision No. --SERVIR-TSC, of  February , the Civil Service Tribunal upheld the appeal filed by the trade union official against the penalty of  days' suspension imposed in November  and revoked that sanction; and () with regard to the constitutional appeal for protection (amparo) filed, through decision No. , of  June , the Second Civil Court of Ica partially granted the request and declared the administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted to be null and void. Mr Mendoza Champion filed an appeal against this decision and the case was scheduled to be heard on  January . Lastly, the Government states that Mr Mendoza Champion continues to be employed as public registrar in the Ica office and has not stopped his trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the result of the appeal.\n.With respect to the appeals filed by Mr Carlos Holgun Nacarino, the Government states that with regard to the penalty imposed for failing to comply with article , paragraphs (a) and (i) of the regulations of the National Superintendence of Public Registries (SUNARP), through departmental decision No. --SUNARP/Z.R, of  July , administrative responsibility was established and a penalty of  days' suspension without pay was imposed. Mr Holgun Nacarino challenged that decision before the Civil Service Tribunal and through decision No. --SERVIR/TSC the appeal was upheld and the decision to impose a sanction was revoked. The Government also states that with regard to the administrative disciplinary proceedings for failing to fulfil duties, departmental decision No. --SUNARP/Z.R, of  December , was issued, declaring that administrative responsibility had not been established. Finally, the Government states that Mr Holgun Nacarino is employed as an asset and stock control manager in the Trujillo office. The Committee notes with interest this information.\n.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Autonomous Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CATP) dated  June .\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  August and  and  October .\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  June , the CATP states that an in-depth analysis of the trade union situation shows that since the change of Government in July , the National Public Records Office (SUNARP) has systematically adopted a hostile and discriminatory attitude against trade union officers, section delegates or members who claim workers' rights or call for compliance with arbitration awards (in particular, those in the central office, in Registry Zone XI of Ica, in Registry Zone V of Trujillo, in Registry Zone IV of Iquitos and in Registry Zone XIII, Tacna office). Specifically, the CATP states more concretely that: () since the beginning of the trade union action taken by the General Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of SUNARP (SITRASUNARP) in the central office, together with the union officers of Registry Zone IX, in protest against the employer s labour policy and calling for labour inspections to verify compliance with the collective agreement, a climate of anti-union discrimination and harassment began to prevail, to the detriment of the General Secretary of SITRASUNARP, Mr Jorge Aliaga Montoya, who ultimately received a reprimand in the form of Decision No. --SUNARP/SN of  May; () Mr Agustn Mendoza Champion, Culture and Training Secretary of the Trade Union of Registry Zone IX, Ica Zone, received a disciplinary penalty for failing to obey the order to cease his trade union activities (in particular, organizing courses on freedom of association and preparing comments on the application of Conventions Nos ,  and ); () in an attempt at intimidation, administrative disciplinary proceedings were instituted against Mr Carlos Holgun Nacarino, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Registry Zone V of Trujillo, who had started submitting complaints against the dismissal of a union member; () Mr Rolando Valdivia Cornejo, Organization Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of Registry Zone XIII, Tacna office, was transferred from his post, preventing him from carrying out his trade union activities; and () Mr Elvis Flix Zavala Guerra, Social Affairs Secretary of the National Federation of Workers of the Public Registry System (FETRASINARP), was suspended for having submitted a complaint regarding the situation of workers who had been subjected to penalties. The union officer was subsequently dismissed on  May .\n.Lastly, the complainant states that in view of this situation, the President of the Republic and the National Public Records Superintendent were informed of the ongoing violations of freedom of association and requested to issue an order for the acts of discrimination being committed at national level in the SUNARP to be stopped, but no reply was received. The complainant considers that in the light of the foregoing, it appears that there is clearly systematic persecution of union officers, who are penalized for complying with the law, and are being subjected to penalties or dismissed on the pretext of disciplinary offences, disloyalty, inefficiency, inability or failure to perform their assigned duties, for the sole purpose of causing panic among members, dismantling the trade union organization and preventing it from operating.\n.In its communications dated  August and  October , the Government states that the allegations relate to workers who were or had been officers of different trade unions of SUNARP at the national level. It adds that the measures adopted and implemented by SUNARP through its various areas and officials were in strict compliance with the labour and administrative regulations in force, objectively applied to cases of non-compliance with such regulations. As regards the allegations relating to five cases of union officers referred to by the complainants, the Government states the following:' concerning Mr Jorge Aliaga Montoya, it was found in the context of administrative disciplinary proceedings that, in his capacity as personnel specialist, he had failed to report the accumulation of unused leave of an important group of workers ' resulting in SUNARP being fined by the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion ' and was thus issued with a written reprimand. The Government adds that the same penalty for the same offence was applied to other staff who are not union members, such as, for example, the Director of Human Resources. Mr Aliaga Montoya is currently working as a personnel specialist in human resources and as a trade union official. He has been provided"", ""Union) reported that its legal adviser was authorized to enter the premises to participate in collective bargaining and that the representative of the union is authorized to enter the workplace to take part in informal meetings and collective bargaining. With regard to recommendation (b), the Government states that inspectors of the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion reported that during interviews it was denied that non unionized workers were entered on a register and that, although the meeting referred to was held on  March , it was only attended by unionized staff. The Government adds that, according to information from the trade union, out-of-date registers do not exist. With regard to recommendation (c), the Government reports that the proceedings contesting dismissal filed by Mr Ivn Bazn Villanueva in  (judicial proceedings No. ----JR-LA-) are currently pending before the judiciary. With regard to recommendation (d), the Government reports that it interviewed the workers concerned, who stated the following: (i) Mr Manihuari has resumed his trade union membership, and his first resignation from membership was due to a disagreement with the then Secretary-General, Mr Bazn Villanueva; (ii) Mr Rodrguez stated that he had left the union owing to disagreement with Mr Bazn Villanueva and that he was currently a member of the union; he also maintained that he had never been pressured to leave the union; (iii) Mr Saavedra Cartagena said that he had left the union without having been pressured in any way or been offered economic incentives; and (iv) the workers Mr Linder Ibarra Zabaleta and Mr Csar Wilfredo Vergara were on secondment and Mr Aquiles del guila Ruiz was on medical leave. With regard to recommendation (e), the Government states that the Regional Directorate for Labour and Employment Promotion issued a decision finding the appeal filed by CORAH unfounded.\n.The Committee takes note of this information. While recalling that  justice delayed is justice denied' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], the Committee hopes that the judicial authority will issue a ruling in the very near future in the proceedings contesting dismissal filed by Mr Ivn Bazn Villanueva in  and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations relating to the new allegations submitted by the complainant concerning the difficulties faced by SUTCORAH with regard to bargaining on lists of demands with CORAH and concerning the invitations to resign from the union sent to unionized workers between January  and January .\n.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Autonomous Confederation of Workers of Peru (CATP) dated  December .\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  May and  October , and February .\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  December , the CATP explained that it has an affiliate union, the Single Union of Workers at CORAH (SUTCORAH), which operates within the Proyecto Especial CORAH (the Special Project for Control and Reduction of Coca Farming in the Alto Huallaga), a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior that exists solely to eradicate illegal farming of coca leaves in Peru. Its workers have contracts under local private labour law. The CATP adds that a very large number of these workers are employed in the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) under the auspices of the United States Embassy.\n.The CATP alleges that, in September , SUTCORAH submitted its list of demands to launch a collective bargaining process with the employer s representatives and a process of conciliation through the Ministry of Labour for the Ucayali region. The employer maintained that it was not in a financial position to meet the main demands of the workers, and that it therefore could not sign the collective agreement. At present, after more than a year of attempts at dialogue and conciliation through the Ministry of Labour, the employer (Proyecto Especial CORAH) still maintains that it lacks the financial resources to fulfil what is asked in the list of demands, arguing that the institution s international budget does not account for these demands. However, despite the foregoing, in June , the whole workforce was awarded a minimal wage increase, which makes a mockery of collective bargaining and of the application for arbitration submitted by the union.\n.Furthermore, the CATP alleges that the employer continues to demand that non-unionized workers sign a  compulsory' register to state that the union does not represent them. The union has reported this to the Ministry of Labour. These claims were corroborated by statements concerning employer interference in connection with the signing of the register made by workers during a labour inspection. Specifically, the inspector took sworn statements from two workers who had recently joined and who claimed they had been made to sign the aforesaid register. The CATP also alleges that, on the first day on which the register was being signed, the meeting of workers called by the union ( March  at  p.m.'  p.m.) was sabotaged; although the meeting had written authorization to proceed, all the relevant managers urged their workers not to attend as it was  during working hours and [they could] not have the necessary permission' \n.Likewise, in March , the general secretary of the union, Mr Ivn Carlos Bazn Villanueva, was arbitrarily dismissed following an accusation of serious misconduct against a female co-worker. This case has been before the court for over a year, during which there has been no significant change in his situation and he has not been reinstated in his previous position, even though at no stage has there been any impartial administrative investigation. The place where the events are alleged to have occurred (the NAS facilities at Pucallpa Airport) is monitored by a large number of security cameras, but no recordings of the events have ever been supplied to shed light on the allegations under investigation.\n.Likewise, the union s sports secretary, Mr Jess Anbal Mancilla Gamero, was also dismissed arbitrarily following an accusation of gross misconduct supposedly against the employer. This accusation is false.\n.The CATP also alleges that six employees who were members of SUTCORAH, Messrs Martn Saavedra Cartagena, Linder Ibarra Zavaleta, Aquiles del guila Ruiz, Csar Wilfredo Vergara Castillo, Daniel Fasabi Manihuari and Jos Ros Rodrguez, were forced to resign their membership. It is claimed that, under threat, coercion and pressure of a rescission of their employment contracts, they were made to register their resignation from the union on the same day, and using the format and type of paper (the size of card used by the NAS), under direct interference from the employer.\n.Furthermore, the employer, Proyecto Especial CORAH, appealed to the Ucayali region Ministry of Labour, requesting the annulment of the order under which the union had been registered. In April , the employer transferred the union s defence secretary, Mr Leoncio Morales, to another post, as a reprisal for his request for labour inspections; this irregular transfer was carried out the same day; the transfer had never been mentioned in the organization s plan.\n.The CATP also alleges that Mr Manuel Fonseca Nez, a union member, was dismissed arbitrarily following an accusation of gross misconduct against Proyecto Especial CORAH.\n.The complainant organization also alleges that SUTCORAH was repeatedly treated by the employer as a  minority union'  even though no other union existed within Proyecto Especial CORAH. It further alleges persistent refusal by the managing director to allow entry to the union s legal adviser and the CATP s own adviser during the process of direct collective bargaining.\n.Lastly, the complainant organization notes a failure to meet legal standards concerning workers' benefits and concerning some general assertions that lack adequate data or names.\n.In its communication of  May , the Government affirms its total respect for the Constitution and other standards concerning the collective rights of workers. It states that the State respects the right to form trade unions, to conduct collective bargaining and to strike, and that it has a vital role to play in ensuring the democratic exercise of those rights; it guarantees freedom of association, encourages collective bargaining, promotes peaceful solutions to labour disputes and regulates the right to strike so that it is exercised in harmony with the interests of society. Both the State and the employers, as well as either of their representatives, are forbidden from acts of any kind that might curtail, restrict or undermine in any way the right of workers to form trade unions, and are forbidden from interfering in any way in the creation, administration or upkeep of trade union organizations formed by those workers. While there is full freedom of association, when a group of workers makes that free and voluntary decision to form a trade union, there is a comprehensive regulatory framework""]"

The Government has sent a number of comments on some of the allegations presented.\n.The Committee examined Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in May  in which it made interim conclusions (see th Report, paras. - and -, respectively, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )). The Committee has examined Case No.  on a number of occasions, the last being in May , in which it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see the th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May )). In all of these interim reports, the Committee urged the Government to provide information on the remaining allegations made by the complainants.\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee expresses its most profound dismay that, in view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations which date back as far as  and which relate to such deplorable actions as killings, disappearances, arrests, physical ill-treatment and torture of trade union leaders and members, the repression of demonstrations and the ransacking of trade union premises, the Government has not submitted any detailed and precise information on the majority of these, or has done so in an incomplete and imprecise manner.\n.As far as the allegations of the killing of trade unionists are concerned, the Committee takes note of the comments of the Government according to which the trade union leader Manuel Guerrero Villegas was abducted by unidentified persons, the miners Seferino Requis and Timoteo Caparachn together with the trade union leader Alcides Palomino Arons were killed by terrorists, the death of the trade union leader Vctor Lopz Oviedo was accidental and that there are no records of the arrest of the teachers Porfirio Suni, Pablo Mamani Marchena and Germn Maceda.\n.The Committee once again notes that a climate of violence which gives rise to the killing or the disappearance of trade union leaders constitutes a severe obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such actions call for severe measures on the part of the authorities, such as the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which killings such as these occurred, and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events (see the th Report, Case No.  (Philippines), para. ).\n.The Committee deeply deplores that, in spite of the considerable time that has passed (six years), the competent authorities have not been able, on the one hand, to identify the perpetrators of the killings of the trade union leaders Manuel Guerrero Villegas, Seferino Requis, Timoteo Caparachn, Csar Alcides Palomino Arons and Vctor Lopz Oviedo and, on the other hand, they have provided no information on the deaths of the other  trade union leaders mentioned in the complaint. Under such circumstances, the Committee once again insists in the strongest terms that the Government institute inquiries without delay into the deaths of the other trade unionists and that it keep the Committee informed of the results of these inquiries. The Committee recalls that the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights (see st Report, Cases Nos. , ,  and  (El Salvador), para. , and nd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Colombia), para. ).\n.With respect to the allegations concerning the detention by the armed forces of seven teachers, five of whose bodies were subsequently found in a mass grave, the Committee notes that, in spite of the long time that has gone by, the complainant has not provided the names of the trade union leaders referred to in the allegations required to conclude this matter.\n.With regard to the disappearance of a number of trade union leaders, the Committee for the time being notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Jos Luiz Aznarn was arrested for terrorism and released four months afterwards and that there was no record of any detentions subsequent to that date, and that, as far as the teacher Leopoldo Navarro Diz was concerned, according to the investigations carried out, there were no reports of his arrest or prosecution for any crime, while the teacher Luis Torrs Camilo is occupying the post of Director of the National School ""Nueva Esperanza"" in the Nuevo Requema district in the Province of Coronel Portilla. It deplores the fact that, in spite of the long time that has gone by (five years), the Government has not been able to clarify the disappearance of Javier Alarcn. The Committee insists that the Government conduct judicial inquiries without delay into the disappearance of these trade unionists and that it keep the Committee informed of the results of these inquiries.\n.With regard to the arrest and illegal imprisonment at the Marcavalle Military Base of ten mineworkers who had then been freed on November , with the exception of the trade unionist Martin Mucha Aliaga, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government, Martin Mucha Aliaga has testified that he had not been arrested in  by the armed forces and that he could not name any other persons who had been arrested. As concerns the detention of the teachers Marcelino Ramrez Pezo and Jos Ramos Bosmediano, the Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government that Marcelino Ramrez Pezo is free but that his whereabouts are unknown, that proceedings have been taken against him for disturbing the peace, a warrant has been issued for him to present himself, and that the Higher Court of Huanaco has decided to extend the proceedings to the charge of terrorism. With regard to Jos Ramos Bosmediano, the Committee takes note for the time being of the comments made by the Government that proceedings are being taken on the charge of disturbing the peace, that he is currently free and that since  June  proceedings were pending appeal of the judgement, and requests the Government to provide it with information as early as possible on the developments concerning the proceedings under way and their outcome.\n.With respect to the arrest, physical ill-treatment and torture of Vctor Taipe, President of the FNTMMSP, and the trade union leader Saturnino Calapuja Salazar, the Committee deplores the fact that, in spite of the long time that has gone by, the Government has restricted itself to replying merely that Vctor Taipe had not been arrested by the armed forces and that no reference had been made to the trade unionist Saturnino Calapuja Salazar. The Committee calls attention once again to the fact that governments should issue the necessary instructions that no person arrested should be the subject of ill-treatment, and should impose effective sanctions where cases of ill-treatment are found. Likewise, the Committee underlines the importance that should be attached to the principle laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, according to which all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person (see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and  respectively). The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry into the serious facts that have been alleged in order to determine the responsibilities, punish those who are guilty and prevent a repetition of such actions, and to keep the Committee informed on the outcome of such inquiries.\n.With respect to the attacks by the police against the trade union of the Peruvian Telephone Company and the arrest of three of the union\'s leaders, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, they were blocking the movement of vehicles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the current situation of the trade unionists being held in detention. In relation to the bullet wounds that had occurred during a trade union demonstration of state workers who were on strike, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these strikers were attempting to enter the headquarters of the Congress violently and aggressively. The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided more details about the bullet wounds, and requests it to immediately open an inquiry about the bullet wounds and to keep it informed about the results of this inquiry.\n.With', '.The Committee has, since , examined these cases of the violation of trade union rights in Peru (Cases Nos. ,  and ) presented by the FNTMMSP, the CGTP and the WCOTP concerning, in particular, allegations of killings, disappearances, detentions, physical ill-treatment and torture of various leaders and trade unionists, repression of demonstrators, ransacking of union premises and violation of trade union rights.\n.The cases were communicated to the Government as and when they were received.

In all of these interim reports, the Committee urged the Government to provide information on the remaining allegations made by the complainants.\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee expresses its most profound dismay that, in view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations which date back as far as  and which relate to such deplorable actions as killings, disappearances, arrests, physical ill-treatment and torture of trade union leaders and members, the repression of demonstrations and the ransacking of trade union premises, the Government has not submitted any detailed and precise information on the majority of these, or has done so in an incomplete and imprecise manner.\n.As far as the allegations of the killing of trade unionists are concerned, the Committee takes note of the comments of the Government according to which the trade union leader Manuel Guerrero Villegas was abducted by unidentified persons, the miners Seferino Requis and Timoteo Caparachn together with the trade union leader Alcides Palomino Arons were killed by terrorists, the death of the trade union leader Vctor Lopz Oviedo was accidental and that there are no records of the arrest of the teachers Porfirio Suni, Pablo Mamani Marchena and Germn Maceda.\n.The Committee once again notes that a climate of violence which gives rise to the killing or the disappearance of trade union leaders constitutes a severe obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such actions call for severe measures on the part of the authorities, such as the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which killings such as these occurred, and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events (see the th Report, Case No.  (Philippines), para. ).\n.The Committee deeply deplores that, in spite of the considerable time that has passed (six years), the competent authorities have not been able, on the one hand, to identify the perpetrators of the killings of the trade union leaders Manuel Guerrero Villegas, Seferino Requis, Timoteo Caparachn, Csar Alcides Palomino Arons and Vctor Lopz Oviedo and, on the other hand, they have provided no information on the deaths of the other  trade union leaders mentioned in the complaint. Under such circumstances, the Committee once again insists in the strongest terms that the Government institute inquiries without delay into the deaths of the other trade unionists and that it keep the Committee informed of the results of these inquiries. The Committee recalls that the absence of judgements against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights (see st Report, Cases Nos. , ,  and  (El Salvador), para. , and nd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Colombia), para. ).\n.With respect to the allegations concerning the detention by the armed forces of seven teachers, five of whose bodies were subsequently found in a mass grave, the Committee notes that, in spite of the long time that has gone by, the complainant has not provided the names of the trade union leaders referred to in the allegations required to conclude this matter.\n.With regard to the disappearance of a number of trade union leaders, the Committee for the time being notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Jos Luiz Aznarn was arrested for terrorism and released four months afterwards and that there was no record of any detentions subsequent to that date, and that, as far as the teacher Leopoldo Navarro Diz was concerned, according to the investigations carried out, there were no reports of his arrest or prosecution for any crime, while the teacher Luis Torrs Camilo is occupying the post of Director of the National School ""Nueva Esperanza"" in the Nuevo Requema district in the Province of Coronel Portilla. It deplores the fact that, in spite of the long time that has gone by (five years), the Government has not been able to clarify the disappearance of Javier Alarcn. The Committee insists that the Government conduct judicial inquiries without delay into the disappearance of these trade unionists and that it keep the Committee informed of the results of these inquiries.\n.With regard to the arrest and illegal imprisonment at the Marcavalle Military Base of ten mineworkers who had then been freed on November , with the exception of the trade unionist Martin Mucha Aliaga, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government, Martin Mucha Aliaga has testified that he had not been arrested in  by the armed forces and that he could not name any other persons who had been arrested. As concerns the detention of the teachers Marcelino Ramrez Pezo and Jos Ramos Bosmediano, the Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government that Marcelino Ramrez Pezo is free but that his whereabouts are unknown, that proceedings have been taken against him for disturbing the peace, a warrant has been issued for him to present himself, and that the Higher Court of Huanaco has decided to extend the proceedings to the charge of terrorism. With regard to Jos Ramos Bosmediano, the Committee takes note for the time being of the comments made by the Government that proceedings are being taken on the charge of disturbing the peace, that he is currently free and that since  June  proceedings were pending appeal of the judgement, and requests the Government to provide it with information as early as possible on the developments concerning the proceedings under way and their outcome.\n.With respect to the arrest, physical ill-treatment and torture of Vctor Taipe, President of the FNTMMSP, and the trade union leader Saturnino Calapuja Salazar, the Committee deplores the fact that, in spite of the long time that has gone by, the Government has restricted itself to replying merely that Vctor Taipe had not been arrested by the armed forces and that no reference had been made to the trade unionist Saturnino Calapuja Salazar. The Committee calls attention once again to the fact that governments should issue the necessary instructions that no person arrested should be the subject of ill-treatment, and should impose effective sanctions where cases of ill-treatment are found. Likewise, the Committee underlines the importance that should be attached to the principle laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, according to which all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person (see Digest, op. cit., paras.  and  respectively). The Committee once again strongly urges the Government to institute an independent judicial inquiry into the serious facts that have been alleged in order to determine the responsibilities, punish those who are guilty and prevent a repetition of such actions, and to keep the Committee informed on the outcome of such inquiries.\n.With respect to the attacks by the police against the trade union of the Peruvian Telephone Company and the arrest of three of the union\'s leaders, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, they were blocking the movement of vehicles. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the current situation of the trade unionists being held in detention. In relation to the bullet wounds that had occurred during a trade union demonstration of state workers who were on strike, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these strikers were attempting to enter the headquarters of the Congress violently and aggressively. The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided more details about the bullet wounds, and requests it to immediately open an inquiry about the bullet wounds and to keep it informed about the results of this inquiry.\n.With', '.The Committee has, since , examined these cases of the violation of trade union rights in Peru (Cases Nos. ,  and ) presented by the FNTMMSP, the CGTP and the WCOTP concerning, in particular, allegations of killings, disappearances, detentions, physical ill-treatment and torture of various leaders and trade unionists, repression of demonstrators, ransacking of union premises and violation of trade union rights.\n.The cases were communicated to the Government as and when they were received.
