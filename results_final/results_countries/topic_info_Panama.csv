These allegations, which constitute Case No. , will also be dealt with by the Committee in the present report, together with the Government's observations thereon, contained in its communication of  September .\n.Panama has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to searches and closing of trade union premises, to take note of the fact that it would appear from the information supplied by the Government that all effects of the measures denounced in the allegations have now ceased, and to decide, subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph , that no useful purpose would be served by pursuing examination of this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the intention of the Government to make trade union membership compulsory and to create a single union, to decide, while reaffirming the principles set forth in paragraph , that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.\n.The original complaints and the additional information supplied in these five cases are dealt with together because they involve the same type of allegation. The complaints are contained in the following communications: two from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated  and  January , one from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC), dated  January , one from the International Federation of Secondary Teachers (FIPESO), dated  February , one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America dated  March , one from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industry, dated  June  and one from the National Federation of Christian Peasants dated  September .\n.As these communications were received they were transmitted to the Government for its observations. These were presented in two communications dated  and  January .\n.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  January  the WCL alleged that the following leaders of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the Peasant Federation were detained in prison: Jorge Emilio Chapote, Pedro Flix Montaez, Teodoro Martinez, Maximino Rodriguez, Domingo Castrelln, Pedro Snchez, Apolinario Snchez, Juan Senz, Rufino Snchez, Carlos Solis, Andrs Snchez, Victor Soto and Raimundo Snchez. In its communication dated  January  the WCL added that the Government was intercepting correspondence, censoring all communications and searching the trade union headquarters of the two organisations mentioned above. For its part, the CLASC confirmed the detention of some of the persons mentioned and added to the list the names of Jos Fiel Senz and Domingo Snchez. The CLASC stated that the Military Junta in power since October  had the headquarters of the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers and the National Christian Peasant Federation searched and that applications for writs of habeas corpus made on behalf of the prisoners were rejected, some of the prisoners being given the alternative of being deported or remaining in prison.\n.The International Federation of Secondary Teachers alleged in its communication of  February  that Mr. Clarence Beecher, Secretary for International Affairs of the Panama Teachers' Association, had been imprisoned, together with other teachers, since  December . The FIPESO added that teachers' public meetings and the publication of their professional journal had been banned.\n.The Permanent Congress on Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America stated in its communication dated  March  that since taking power the Military Junta had created a permanent state of repression directed against the trade union movement, behind the shield of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees. The complainants went on to say that the Federation of Workers' Unions of Panama had been the subject of a search by the National Guard, as well as other trade union premises, including those of the tailors', building workers' and bus drivers' unions, etc. On the occasion of these searches, members of the National Guard destroyed and seized trade union property and kept the trade union premises closed, thus obstructing all union activity. The complainants further alleged that the trade union leaders Angel Gmez, Jos del Carmen Tun, Florencio de Gracia, Sixto Valarezo, Ramn Diaz, Efigenio Arauz and Pedro Gonzlez, had already been in prison for more than three months.\n.The Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleged in its communication of  June  that the Military Government had closed down the headquarters of the Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and a number of affiliated organisations, including the premises of the Federation of Building Workers. The complainants added that several trade union leaders were being kept in prison and referred to the names of some of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in particular Mr. Angel Gmez, who was said to be critically ill with pneumonia and had been taken as a matter of urgency to a hospital but had since been taken back to prison.\n.Lastly, the National Federation of Christian Peasants of Panama stated in its complaint dated  September  that on  October  individual guarantees had been suspended by the Government with the result that rural and urban trade union leaders were being persecuted and imprisoned. The persons arrested were: Natividad Martinez, arrested on  September  in the district of Palmar in Cocl province, charged with possessing arms, after his house had been searched by the army; Bernab Reyes, Secretary General of the El Palmar Agrarian League, arrested on  September, the reason for his arrest not having been made known; Leonardo Montero, Secretary General of the Cao El Rey Agrarian League, accused by the judge and the mayor of the district of Donoso, Coln Province, as an act of reprisal. The complaining organisation added that pressure had been brought to bear on the peasants' organisations to give up any trade union activity not controlled by the Government and that every day more trade union leaders were being arrested.\n.In its communications dated  and  January  the Government stated that after careful examination of the various complaints presented, it had reached the conclusion that the allegations were unfounded and that the trade union organisations of the country had without interruption been functioning in accordance with the provisions of the law in force. The labour authorities had always been motivated by concern that the trade union movement should be vigorous and managed by the workers themselves. For its part, the Government had on no occasion arrested any citizen on account of his being a trade union leader, but only for participation in political activities entirely unrelated to trade union matters. The persons arrested on various occasions after  October  had been set at liberty, and the complaint relating to the present detention of trade union leaders was therefore inadmissible. The allegations relating to the persecution and imprisonment of leaders and pressure that had been exercised against the peasant organisations were also rejected, since the Government had placed at the disposal of the inhabitants of the interior of the country adequate facilities for them to organise and carry on proper trade union activities.\n.The Committee observes that the various complaints allege the detention of trade union leaders since the Military Government came into power and suspended Constitutional guarantees in October . Some of the allegations also refer to searches of the premises of various trade union organisations, in particular the Isthmian Federation of Christian Workers, the National Christian Peasants' Federation, the National Trade Union Federation of the Workers of Panama and the Building Workers' Federation, and in certain cases the closing of the premises affected. The complaints also refer to the persecution of trade union leaders and pressure exercised against the peasants' organisations. The Government, for its part, denies, in a general way, any persecution directed against trade unionists and states that no person has been arrested on account of his being a trade unionist, but only for participation in political activities.

The complainants allege that the enterprise obliged workers, when signing the employment contract, to join a union controlled by the enterprise: the FQM Construction and Development Enterprise Workers' Union (hereafter  the enterprise workers' union'  and that employment contracts were not given to those who refused to join.\n.The complainant organizations indicate that, as a result of the labour exploitation of the mining project workers, who work more than -hour days without any occupational health and safety measures, a strike began on  March  and ended six days later, with mediation by the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL) and with the signing of an agreement in which the enterprise agreed to address their concerns relating to occupational safety, food distribution and transportation. The complainants allege that the enterprise never fulfilled this agreement. They also indicate that the lack of safety and health measures led to the death on  December  of -year-old worker Faustino Daz.\n.The complainant organizations state that, even though SUNTRACS is the most representative union in the construction sector, MITRADEL has always ruled in favour of the enterprise and the enterprise workers' union, recognizing it as the so-called representative of the workers and denying SUNTRACS the right to negotiate with the enterprise on behalf of its members. The complainants allege that MITRADEL s decisions of  November  and  April  are proof of this. They have provided a copy of the latter decision, which states that: (i) SUNTRACS and the enterprise workers' union simultaneously submitted of demands, and MITRADEL issued a decision ordering both to agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists with the enterprise, warning that should they fail to do so, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (ii) SUNTRACS submitted an application for amparo, which was granted due to the lack of grounds for the decision calling for the unions to agree and the violation of due process; (iii) MITRADEL issued a new decision ordering the unions to, within two working days, agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists, warning that should they fail to do so within the prescribed timeframe, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (iv) this decision was the subject of an administrative appeal filed by SUNTRACS, which was denied, thus upholding the decision; (v) the parties failed to reach an agreement and, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, MITRADEL tallied the number of members, establishing  members in SUNTRACS and  members in the enterprise workers' union, enabling the latter to negotiate the lists of both unions; and (vi) the decision was subject to appeal and review.\n.The complainant organizations indicate that on  February , the workers held a strike, demanding a wage increase, respectful treatment, health care and the negotiation of a collective agreement between SUNTRACS and the enterprise. They state that the strike ended on  February  and that, two days later, they signed an agreement that put an end to the collective dispute, in which the enterprise agreed to, inter alia: (i) re-hire any workers who had participated in the strikes and whose short-term contracts had ended between  and  February ; (ii) initiate discussions with SUNTRACS aimed at finding solutions to various labour-related demands, including the negotiation of a new collective labour agreement between the parties; and (iii) not take reprisals against workers for having participated in the strike. The complainants allege that, with the complicity of MITRADEL, the enterprise has not honoured any of the terms established in the agreement. The complainants have sent a copy of a record dated  April , in which MITRADEL observed that the enterprise had not complied with the agreement dated  March  with regard to the re-hiring of workers who had been dismissed for having participated in the strike from  to  February . In the record, MITRADEL stated that it was going to explore legal measures to enforce the agreement.\n.The complainant organizations also indicate that the enterprise refused to comply with reinstatement orders issued in favour of over  workers who had been dismissed without any justification or legal basis and that, in protest against the enterprise s failure to comply with the reinstatement orders, on  June , the workers held a peaceful protest at the entrance to the enterprise, which was violently repressed by Cocle national police and the enterprise s private security, who hit and arbitrarily arrested the workers who had been dismissed: Adolfo Yerena, Carlos Gondola, Hector Ramos Joniel Hall, Erick Prez, Luis Gaitan, Luis Martines, Jos Borbua, Jos Bonilla, Dagoberto Chang, Alejandro Valds and journalist Francis Guerra from an alternative media source, Frenadeso Noticias. The complainants indicate that when the workers filed a complaint, they were illegally taken into custody by members of the national police.\n.In its communications of  September  and  June , the UGT indicates that within the mining project, there is an enterprise workers' union, presently known as the Industrial Union of Mine Construction and Mining Development and Allied Workers (STM), which is affiliated with the UGT and with Trade Union Convergence. The UGT indicates that since the s, SUNTRACS and the Panamanian Construction Industry Board (CAPAC) (enterprise organization) have been concluding collective labour agreements and alleges that the Government has been allowing SUNTRACS to try to impose on workers who are not members of SUNTRACS and who work in enterprises that are not affiliated with CAPAC the collective labour agreements signed by these two organizations. It also alleges that the Government has been complicit and allowed SUNTRACS to oblige the construction workers to pay it union dues, even though they are not members of the organization and even though the enterprises for which they work are not members of CAPAC. According to the complainant, this situation has caused chaos and confrontations between the mining project workers. The UGT further alleges that SUNTRACS is trying to have a union monopoly in the country and that the Government is being passive in this regard.\n.The complainant organization has sent a document entitled  Violence and blackmail by the main leaders of SUNTRACS' dated  March , which indicates that SUNTRACS s political struggle for a union monopoly in the country spans more than two decades and that its strategy is based on discrediting other trade union leaders who do not support its interests and on inflicting violence and terrorizing workers and business owners. The document also mentions that on  January , a group of workers and activists supported by SUNTRACS violently took over the premises of the enterprise undertaking the mining project, injuring  workers. Furthermore, in February , SUNTRACS violently barged into the enterprise, leading the UGT to question why the Government allowed SUNTRACS to illegally occupy the enterprise premises for over  hours and why the Government would oblige the enterprise to sign an agreement with a non-mining-related trade union. The complainant has sent links to various articles published in the press referring to the above.\n.The complainant organization has also sent a document entitled  Chronology of the conflict in Minera Panam'  according to which: (i) the enterprise workers' union acquired legal status in February  and continues to be the majority union in the mining project; (ii) on  September , MITRADEL registered the first collective agreement between the enterprise workers' union and the enterprise, which is valid for four years; (iii) on  March , a group of workers from a CAPAC-affiliated contracting enterprise for the Minera Panam project carried out a work stoppage, blocking the exit of workers from all areas of project; given that these workers were covered by a collective labour agreement concluded between SUNTRACS and CAPAC, the latter demanded that the"", "".The complaints are contained in communications from the Single National Union of Construction Industry and Allied Workers (SUNTRACS), the National Confederation of United Independent Unions (CONUSI) and Building and Wood Workers' International (ICM) dated  June  (Case No. ) and from the General Workers' Union Confederation of Panama (UGT) dated  November  and  June  (Case No. ).\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  February, as well as  June and  September .\n.Panama has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.The Committee has decided to examine these two cases together, since they concern a similar issue, although raised from different union perspectives, and also because, in its replies, the Government emphasized that the cases are related.\n.In their communication dated  June , the complainant organizations (SUNTRACS, CONUSI and the ICM) indicate that in , Minera Panam SA (hereafter  the enterprise' , a subsidiary of the Canadian mining company First Quantum Minerals (FQM), was awarded an over -year lease to develop a copper-mining project (hereafter  the mining project' , which was launched in December .

They have provided a copy of the latter decision, which states that: (i) SUNTRACS and the enterprise workers' union simultaneously submitted of demands, and MITRADEL issued a decision ordering both to agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists with the enterprise, warning that should they fail to do so, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (ii) SUNTRACS submitted an application for amparo, which was granted due to the lack of grounds for the decision calling for the unions to agree and the violation of due process; (iii) MITRADEL issued a new decision ordering the unions to, within two working days, agree on the appointment of a joint representative to negotiate both lists, warning that should they fail to do so within the prescribed timeframe, the majority union would negotiate the lists; (iv) this decision was the subject of an administrative appeal filed by SUNTRACS, which was denied, thus upholding the decision; (v) the parties failed to reach an agreement and, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, MITRADEL tallied the number of members, establishing  members in SUNTRACS and  members in the enterprise workers' union, enabling the latter to negotiate the lists of both unions; and (vi) the decision was subject to appeal and review.\n.The complainant organizations indicate that on  February , the workers held a strike, demanding a wage increase, respectful treatment, health care and the negotiation of a collective agreement between SUNTRACS and the enterprise. They state that the strike ended on  February  and that, two days later, they signed an agreement that put an end to the collective dispute, in which the enterprise agreed to, inter alia: (i) re-hire any workers who had participated in the strikes and whose short-term contracts had ended between  and  February ; (ii) initiate discussions with SUNTRACS aimed at finding solutions to various labour-related demands, including the negotiation of a new collective labour agreement between the parties; and (iii) not take reprisals against workers for having participated in the strike. The complainants allege that, with the complicity of MITRADEL, the enterprise has not honoured any of the terms established in the agreement. The complainants have sent a copy of a record dated  April , in which MITRADEL observed that the enterprise had not complied with the agreement dated  March  with regard to the re-hiring of workers who had been dismissed for having participated in the strike from  to  February . In the record, MITRADEL stated that it was going to explore legal measures to enforce the agreement.\n.The complainant organizations also indicate that the enterprise refused to comply with reinstatement orders issued in favour of over  workers who had been dismissed without any justification or legal basis and that, in protest against the enterprise s failure to comply with the reinstatement orders, on  June , the workers held a peaceful protest at the entrance to the enterprise, which was violently repressed by Cocle national police and the enterprise s private security, who hit and arbitrarily arrested the workers who had been dismissed: Adolfo Yerena, Carlos Gondola, Hector Ramos Joniel Hall, Erick Prez, Luis Gaitan, Luis Martines, Jos Borbua, Jos Bonilla, Dagoberto Chang, Alejandro Valds and journalist Francis Guerra from an alternative media source, Frenadeso Noticias. The complainants indicate that when the workers filed a complaint, they were illegally taken into custody by members of the national police.\n.In its communications of  September  and  June , the UGT indicates that within the mining project, there is an enterprise workers' union, presently known as the Industrial Union of Mine Construction and Mining Development and Allied Workers (STM), which is affiliated with the UGT and with Trade Union Convergence. The UGT indicates that since the s, SUNTRACS and the Panamanian Construction Industry Board (CAPAC) (enterprise organization) have been concluding collective labour agreements and alleges that the Government has been allowing SUNTRACS to try to impose on workers who are not members of SUNTRACS and who work in enterprises that are not affiliated with CAPAC the collective labour agreements signed by these two organizations. It also alleges that the Government has been complicit and allowed SUNTRACS to oblige the construction workers to pay it union dues, even though they are not members of the organization and even though the enterprises for which they work are not members of CAPAC. According to the complainant, this situation has caused chaos and confrontations between the mining project workers. The UGT further alleges that SUNTRACS is trying to have a union monopoly in the country and that the Government is being passive in this regard.\n.The complainant organization has sent a document entitled  Violence and blackmail by the main leaders of SUNTRACS' dated  March , which indicates that SUNTRACS s political struggle for a union monopoly in the country spans more than two decades and that its strategy is based on discrediting other trade union leaders who do not support its interests and on inflicting violence and terrorizing workers and business owners. The document also mentions that on  January , a group of workers and activists supported by SUNTRACS violently took over the premises of the enterprise undertaking the mining project, injuring  workers. Furthermore, in February , SUNTRACS violently barged into the enterprise, leading the UGT to question why the Government allowed SUNTRACS to illegally occupy the enterprise premises for over  hours and why the Government would oblige the enterprise to sign an agreement with a non-mining-related trade union. The complainant has sent links to various articles published in the press referring to the above.\n.The complainant organization has also sent a document entitled  Chronology of the conflict in Minera Panam'  according to which: (i) the enterprise workers' union acquired legal status in February  and continues to be the majority union in the mining project; (ii) on  September , MITRADEL registered the first collective agreement between the enterprise workers' union and the enterprise, which is valid for four years; (iii) on  March , a group of workers from a CAPAC-affiliated contracting enterprise for the Minera Panam project carried out a work stoppage, blocking the exit of workers from all areas of project; given that these workers were covered by a collective labour agreement concluded between SUNTRACS and CAPAC, the latter demanded that the"", 'Ministry of the Interior and Justice, the Comptroller General of the Republic and the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy. Nevertheless, despite the exchanges taking place among the principal actors involved and the express desire of the President of the Republic, Dr. Ernesto Prez Balladares, to find a final solution to the request to finalize the draft Bill on air traffic controllers, on  November , with no valid reason or justified cause, the air traffic controllers announced their intention, in their capacity as a group of public servants, to suspend their work.\n.The Government states that following the communiqu issued by APACTA, the Civil Aeronautics Directorate convened a meeting on  November , which was the day on which it found out about APACTA\'s decision, and it was at that meeting that the representative of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy informed them of the need to modify the draft Bill, promising a reply within a week. On the afternoon of  November the air traffic controllers presented an ultimatum which was subsequently carried out, the grounds given being the fact that the draft Bill had not been passed by the Government. The complete suspension of the air traffic control service meant that all air links with the country were cut, entailing massive financial losses for both the State and private individuals estimated in terms of millions per day for the sectors concerned. It should be pointed out that the Ministry of Labour had no involvement in the air traffic controllers abandoning their duties as that ministry only has authority in labour matters and the provisions of the prevailing Labour Code are not generally applied to the public services. APACTA is an association of public officials (APACTA\'s by-laws and regulations correspond to the provisions of the Civil Code); it is seeking to have a Bill passed which, if it became a law of the Republic, would institute the principles and standards aspired to by its members.\n.The Government explains that the serious offence committed by the air traffic controllers (only  out of  air traffic controllers came to work) in the only national institution to provide essential services and facilities for the safety of civil aviation at the domestic and international levels, caused the Director-General of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate, in application of the powers vested in him by the institution\'s organizational law, and the internal staff regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate in force since , to dismiss from their posts the  officials who promoted, encouraged, supported and participated in the ill-timed and injurious massive abandonment of their duties; subsequently paying them the employment benefits they were owed. In accordance with section  of the Constitution the State can apply special restrictions to strikes in the public services, and the Labour Code also requires that the provision of such services be guaranteed in the event of legally declared strikes. The air traffic controllers\' abandonment of their duties on  November  endangered the safety of aircraft and the lives of their passengers, as well as of the general population, and also involved huge financial losses. The strike meant that the Civil Aeronautics Directorate could not offer its usual services in the areas of air communication, radar, radio and air traffic control for the domestic and international airlines that use them daily with the required levels of safety, efficiency, quality and speed. Furthermore, Panamanian legislation governing public servants stipulates (section  (clauses ,  and  of Act No.  of ) which applies to all state servants in accordance with section  of the Act), that the following constitute grounds for the ""immediate dismissal"" of a public servant: unjustifiably to alter, delay or refuse ... the provision of the service he usually performs, in keeping with the responsibilities of his position; ""not to be present at or not to remain at the workplace providing the service until the arrival of his replacement; to carry out or participate in strikes that are prohibited or declared illegal, or to fail to observe the requirement for essential services during legal strikes"". Moreover, the prevailing Penal Code stipulates in sections ,  and  that the following constitute offences punishable by imprisonment: ""any act which endangers the safety of air transport"" and any act which impedes or interferes with the usual operation of public services which is carried out while the official is still legally bound to perform such services. The air traffic controllers\' actions were extremely detrimental to the airlines, the users and the national economy and the abandonment of their duties was entirely contrary to prevailing legislation. The Attorney-General\'s office is carrying out the appropriate investigation into the alleged commission of these offences (acts against means of transport and communication, conspiracy to commit an offence and abuse of authority and infringement of public servants) on the part of the air traffic controllers.\n.The Government recalls also that the Committee on Freedom of Association has, in similar cases, declared that strikes may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term (that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population) and more specifically has considered air traffic control to be an essential service. The Government concludes by pointing out that Panama has honoured and continues to honour its commitments vis--vis the Conventions it has ratified, including Conventions Nos.  and , and that in addition it is a signatory of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, adopted by way of Act No.  of  November , which imposes on the contracting States a high degree of responsibility with respect to air traffic safety, and it was this that was put under threat by the actions of the air traffic controllers.\n.The Government also refers to acts which it qualifies as serious that took place in the radar control centre in Balboa on the day of the strike and which are attributable to the strikers. Specifically, they removed all instructions and information material (documents, forms, telephone books, etc.) and changed the passwords for the radar system which meant that this could not be used during the  hours following this act, endangering human lives and goods. Because of this it was not possible to carry out an air traffic control service and only basic flight information was available. The strikers\' attitude gave rise to situations where there was conflict of movement in the air traffic. Moreover, from  to  November  the strikers\' representatives (the leadership of APACTA) were offered a new work timetable which would allow air traffic controllers to return to work but the latter decided to continue the strike. These representatives, however, told their membership that they had no reason to go to work as they had been dismissed.\n.In its communication of  October  the Government provided the following information:-- the decision not to work by public servants of the Civil Aeronautics Directorate who carry out air traffic control duties and other duties which are part of their job description in the various airports in Panama was aimed at achieving the following benefits for them as civil servants in the State\'s service: the passing of legislation which would regulate their career, better salaries and special retirement terms. At no time could it be considered that they were claiming union rights as, according to the national legal system, they do not fall under the standards laid down in the Labour Code. Their work and conduct falls under the standards of the Administrative Code and the law for administrative careers;-- the reason for their decision not to work was, according to their press release, to make the executive body present a Bill to achieve regulation of the career of air traffic controller, approval for a salary scale and special terms for retirement, among other things;-- the former air traffic controllers were not ""deprived"" of the right to strike because their job took place within the regulations for public servants. The Government notes that there is no conciliation and arbitration procedure to resolve conflict situations between public servants and the national Government (in this case the Civil Aeronautics Directorate as an autonomous entity of the State) in current legislation in force;-- the fact that these civil servants who were air traffic controllers decided not to carry out their duties gave rise to incidents which affected public safety (the Government refers back to information that it has already provided to the Committee);-- the former air traffic controllers ceased to carry out their duties on  November  at  a.m. and this was to continue until the Government complied with their requests.\n.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant is objecting to the dismissal of numerous air traffic controllers who had declared a strike in order to achieve appropriate legal regulation of the working conditions of air traffic controllers following the non-promulgation of a Bill drawn up by a tripartite committee']"

The Department of Social Organizations does not, however, interfere with regards changes to executive committees, nor issues involving trade union immunity. Rather, those changes are transmitted to the department so that the database can be updated and the information certified should such an assurance be sought by interested parties. The Government attaches a copy of the manual of procedures, published in the Official Journal No.  of  January .\n.As to the alleged freezing of  requests for trade union registration over the last ten months, thus avoiding implementation of the Labour Code and infringing provisions of Conventions Nos  and , the Government states that, once the appropriate inquiries were carried out before the Department of Social Organizations, nine legal personalities were granted under the current administration, far exceeding the number granted under any previous administration. The Government highlights that section  of the Labour Code establishes that:Once the  calendar days referred to under articles  and  have expired, should the request for registration not have been rejected or objected to, the trade union, federation, confederation or workers' central organization shall be considered to be registered for all legal purposes and, consequently, the Ministry is obliged to issue the respective documents and certifications and to add the corresponding entry to the registry of social organizations.\n.The Government goes on to state that, under the above provision, once the period established has expired, should the request for registration not have been rejected or objected to, the trade union, federation, confederation or workers' central organization shall be considered to be registered. Thus, it would be impossible to freeze  requests for trade union registration, given that under the law, they would have to have been registered and the corresponding certifications issued. The Government clarifies, however, that it would be impossible to grant legal personalities outside the framework of the law, that is to say, to bodies which fail to comply with the requirements established under the Act through actions such as: the presentation of a provisional list of members, failure to provide personal identity cards, errors of form (and sometimes of substance) concerning statutes, as well as the founding instrument or its clauses, among other causes or omissions leading to refusal of registration.\n.As to Act No.  of  June , establishing a special regime for the area of Bar, the Government states that for several decades now Puerto Armuelles and the district of Bar, in particular, have suffered from social, cultural, economic and health problems, owing to the failure of previous administrations to implement sustainable policies, an issue that the Government is addressing in a responsible manner. Assessments were carried out across the region, in order to identify possible opportunities for development. It was concluded that there was a need to establish an appropriate mechanism for attracting economic investment to the district in the form of a special economic area. The project took the form of a suitable integral development plan, based on the establishment of a special integral regime for the establishment and operation of enterprises, manufacturing industries and any economic activity that will contribute to the national and global economy through the export of goods and services, promoting investment and encouraging scientific, technological, economic, cultural, educational, health and social development in the country.\n.The labour legislation was drawn up with employment promotion in mind, guaranteeing a / business environment through changes in terms of varying shifts and rest days (not necessarily Sundays). MITRADEL set up the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, which carried out large-scale consultations, dialogues and presentations aimed at the workers of the area, who, in turn, expressed their support for the project.\n.As to the allegations relating to Act No.  of , the Government states that it concluded the National Tripartite Dialogue Forum with sectors of civil society, which met for over three months of intense debate over Act No. . Tripartite agreements were signed under which it was agreed that Act No.  would be split into six bills, to be approved at a future date by the legislative body.\n.Act No.  was repealed in October  in the framework of a national tripartite dialogue which led to the approval of various acts by the National Assembly, including an act containing labour reforms (all of which were duly agreed on at the Tripartite Dialogue Forum). The arguments of the complainants were rendered groundless by the repeal of Act No. .\n.Finally, the Government reiterates that it respects the Conventions on the freedom of association and collective bargaining that it has ratified. It is for this reason that it has been making every effort to ensure their implementation within a framework of dialogue with the social actors. Therefore, the current labour administration, taking into account the reality of the current situation and in order to comply with Conventions Nos  and  on freedom of association and to promote the social dialogue, has been examining the possibility of establishing a higher labour council as the consultative tripartite body of the executive body, attached to MITRADEL, with the aim of regulating dialogue and promoting economic and social cooperation between the public authorities and the employers' and workers' organizations of the country with regards labour issues, with the technical support of the ILO.\n.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege recent legal reforms and rulings restricting fundamental trade union rights, refusal to recognize the public servants' organization FENASEP in practice, the exclusion of FENASEP from tripartite bodies, refusal to grant FENASEP educational insurance funds for trade union training, the freezing of the recognition of  trade union organizations and the dismissal of a trade union leader.\n.As to the allegations regarding restrictions on trade union rights contained in Act No.  of , concerning the right to strike, the deduction of union fees through a check-off facility, the possibility of recourse to arbitration and the establishment, in the light of this Act (or law), of COTRAPA in order to suppress CONATO, the Committee takes due note of the Government s statements concerning the repeal of Act No.  in October of , within the framework of a national tripartite dialogue which led to the approval by the National Assembly of various acts containing reforms which had been duly agreed on.\n.As to the allegations regarding Act No.  of  June , establishing a special regime for the area of Bar, which includes a provision allowing enterprises to operate for the first six years without undertaking bargaining processes concerning collective labour agreements (section  of the Act) and that the employers' central CONEP and the workers' central CONATO are not represented on the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, the Committee notes that the Government states that the aim of the Act is to address important social, economic and cultural issues while attracting economic investment and promoting employment. According to the Government, the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development established the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, which has carried out consultations, dialogues and presentations aimed at the workers of the area, who, in turn, have expressed their support for the project.\n.The Committee wishes to point out that the right to collective bargaining is a fundamental right of the workers and their organizations and that Convention No.  only allows exceptions to the right to collective bargaining with regards officials engaged in the administration of the State, the armed forces or the police. Consequently, the Committee considers that section  of Act No.  constitutes a direct violation of Convention No.  and therefore urges the Government to take the necessary measures to repeal said provision without delay. Furthermore, noting that the Government has not responded to the complainants' allegation that the representatives of the country s workers' and employers' centrals are not represented on the Administration Committee of the Special Economic Area of Bar, the Committee, recalling the importance of consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations with regards labour issues, requests the Government to consider, together with those organizations, the possibility of the latter being represented on the Administration Committee, in order that they might be consulted on issues affecting their members, and to keep it informed in this regard.\n.As to the allegations regarding a manual of procedures for the Department of Social Organizations (ministerial ruling of  December ), which according to the complainants restricts the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that said Manual does not limit freedom of association and that it is in keeping with the Constitution and the Labour Code. The Committee observes that the complainant organizations highlight in particular the fact that the Manual requires that the rules governing executives must be  approved' by the Ministry of Labour and allows this Ministry to"", ""intervene ex officio in disputes between trade union organizations, as well as to supervise trade union electoral processes. The Committee observes that the text of the Manual (copy provided by the Government) does not seem to have been subject to consultations with the most representative trade union organizations. Rather, it is claimed that the Manual consists of a series of flexible procedures aimed at speeding up the administrative process and the Government is ready to consider any recommendations that might arise from its application. The Committee considers that certain terms employed in the Manual, such as the  approval' of executive committees, may give rise to problems of interpretation and requests the Government to examine said Manual with the most representative workers' organizations in order to clear up any misunderstandings and produce a text which enjoys as much support as possible.\n.As to the alleged increase of the minimum number of public servants required to establish a trade union association in the public sector ( servants), in the light of Act No. , the Committee takes note of the Government s statement that: () the number of public servants required stood at  in  (Act No. ); () without any prior study being carried out, the minimum number of members required to form an organization of public servants was amended to ; and () the new amendment of  (Act No. ) re-established  as the minimum number of members required to form an organization of public servants. In this regard the Committee wishes to highlight the principle that  The requirements prescribed by law for the establishment of a trade union should not be applied in such a manner as to delay or prevent the establishment of trade union organizations. Any delay caused by the authorities in registering a trade union constitutes an infringement of Article  of Convention No. .' Furthermore, the Committee refers to the article concerning the principle it established regarding enterprise trade unions, which states that  The establishment of a trade union may be considerably hindered, or even rendered impossible, when legislation fixes the minimum number of members of a trade union at obviously too high a figure, as is the case, for example, where legislation requires that a union must have at least  founder members.' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ].\n.The Committee also recalls that the Committee of Experts had considered the requirement of  public servants for the establishment of a trade union association in Panama to be excessive and had requested the Government to reduce that figure. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend Act No.  in order to reduce the minimum number of public servants necessary to establish a trade union association, given that an excessively high minimum number could restrict trade union rights, in particular in certain public institutions and small municipalities.\n.As to the allegation that, in the light of Act No.  of , public servants dismissed unfairly and then reinstated through a ruling do not have the right to receive the lost wages for the period between the moment of separation and that of reinstatement, the Committee notes the Government s statement that this allegation is groundless and notes that the Government backs up this claim by referring to two Supreme Court rulings obliging the State to pay the wages and other benefits. The Committee notes that the Government only sent one of the rulings, dated  February , when, in fact, Act No.  was adopted in . The Committee would therefore be grateful if the Government would send other rulings supporting its statement.\n.As to the allegations regarding the organization of public servants FENASEP i.e. refusal by the authorities to recognize FENASEP in practice, despite the fact that FENASEP representatives have participated in the ILC as delegates on several occasions, exclusion of representatives of this organization from the Technical Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee in the light of Act No.  of  July , denial of education insurance funds (trade union training) previously enjoyed by FENASEP ' affecting, in particular, all those public servants from whose salaries . per cent is deducted for the education insurance (thus discriminating between trade union associations of public servants and private sector trade unions), the Committee notes the Government s statements that: () FENASEP is an association of public servants who are remunerated by the State, with legal personality granted by the Ministry of Government, governed by the Administrative Careers Act as a not-for-profit association, and not a trade union governed by the Labour Code and registered with the Ministry of Labour; () therefore it is not possible to claim treatment and benefits, such as the education insurance appropriation, equal to those enjoyed by trade unions if associations of public servants are not covered by those benefits; and () Act No.  of  July  ensures the participation of public servants and the Government in the Expert Committee and the Appeal and Conciliation Committee of the Administrative Career Service. According to the Government, the Constitution would have to be amended for FENASEP to be considered as a trade union organization. The Government recognizes, however, that FENASEP participates in CONATO and was established for purposes which seem to coincide with those of a trade union organization. The Committee also recalls that, under the law, FENASEP enjoys the right to conclude collective agreements.\n.The Committee wishes to highlight that associations of public servants, whether they call themselves trade unions or not, must enjoy all the rights and guarantees contained in Convention No. , which only allows the armed forces and the police to be excluded from enjoying such rights and guarantees. The Committee wishes to emphasize that the public servants' organization FENASEP (whose representatives have participated in the ILC on several occasions and which is considered by the Government to be a representative association) recently had its right to enjoy education insurance funds for trade union training withdrawn despite the fact that public servants contribute . per cent of their salaries to said fund. Moreover, FENASEP has been excluded from the Expert Committee and the Appeals and Conciliation Committee of the Administrative Career. The Committee believes that the arguments for these exclusions advanced by the Government do not justify such treatment and requests the Government to initiate a constructive dialogue with FENASEP in order to find a solution to the problems which will avoid any risk of discrimination against the organization while allowing it to be recognized for all purposes in connection with its representativeness.\n.As to the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has frozen  requests for trade union registration over the past ten months, the Committee notes that the Government states that the current administration has granted nine new legal personalities to trade union organizations (far exceeding the number granted under any previous administration), recalling that in cases of administrative silence trade union organizations having applied for registration should be considered to be registered. The Committee also notes that the Government states that legal personality cannot be granted unless the legal requirements have been fulfilled (submission of the list of members, presentation of identity cards, failure to provide founding act or the clauses of the statutes). The Committee requests the Government to indicate those trade unions which have not been registered despite the fact that they have submitted applications for registration and to communicate the reasoned administrative rulings behind the non-registration of trade union organizations.\n.As to the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz (according to the allegations, the General Secretary of the Association of Employees of ASEMITRABS) in violation of Act No.  on the protection of trade union leaders (trade union immunity), the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () this association is completely unknown to the majority of public servants working within the Ministry of Labour and no employees' associations currently operate within the Ministry; () Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz lodged a judicial complaint before the Third Administrative Disputes Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which will rule on the legal merit of the claim. The Committee requests the Government to communicate the result of the appeal lodged against the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz and, given that the Government disputes his appointment as General Secretary and even the existence of his association of public employees (despite the fact that the complainant organizations have sent a public instrument drawn up by a solicitor which vouches for ASEMITRABS' establishment and executive committee), to indicate whether said association has applied for registration and legal personality and, should that be the case, to indicate the reasons why that application was unsuccessful.\n.As to the alleged campaign to discredit the trade union leaders in the eyes of the public, in particular involving threats to denounce various trade union leaders to the Public Ministry for alleged inconsistencies in the management of"", ""Act No.  on the protection of trade union leaders (trade union immunity), the Committee request the Government to communicate the result of the appeal lodged against the dismissal of Mr Vctor C. Castillo Daz and, given that the Government disputes his appointment as Secretary General and even the existence of his association of public employees (despite the fact that the complainant organizations have sent a public instrument drawn up by a solicitor which vouches for ASEMITRABS' establishment and executive committee), to indicate whether said association has applied for registration and legal personality and, should that be the case, to indicate the reasons why that application was unsuccessful.(g)\tThe Committee requests the Government to send it copies of any rulings or charges brought by the Public Ministry against trade union leaders for illicit diversion of public education insurance funds earmarked for trade union training.(h)\tFinally, the Committee notes that the Government has been examining the possibility of establishing a higher labour council as a consultative body in order to promote social dialogue concerning labour issues with the technical support of the ILO, and that it has formally requested ILO technical assistance in harmonizing national legislation and practice with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  (the Government highlights that request in the part of this document regarding the allegations affecting FENASEP). The Committee expresses the firm hope that said technical assistance will be established in the very near future.\n.In its communication dated  December , the Government refers to the Committee s recommendation (a) contained in its th Report and states that Act No.  of  April  repealed Act No.  of  June  (including section , which allowed enterprises in the area of Bar to operate for the first six years without undertaking collective bargaining in order to align its legislation with ILO Convention Nos  and . The repeal is the result of the agreements of the special tripartite committee for the forum for dialogue set up by the Government.\n.As regards the Committee s recommendation (b), the Government states that in , the Ministry of Labour and Social Development will carry out a comprehensive review of the Manual of Procedures for trade union organizations, which will provide an opportunity for intervention and making suggestions to confederations, trade union centres, federations and other organizations; that will encourage them to participate in the process and will better assist them in their various trade union procedures.\n.As regards the Committee s recommendation (c), in which it finds the minimum number of  public servants needed to establish a trade union association in the public sector (pursuant to Act No.  of ) to be excessive, the Government states that the objective of the reform committee for the Act governing administrative careers is to amend the relevant section to provide as follows:  there may be more than one trade union association within a public institution'  This amendment will then be submitted to the executive body to be studied and given due consideration. The Government adds that the objective of the reform committee for the Act governing administrative careers is also to amend section  of Act No.  of  July  to enable all public servants, including non career public servants, as well as those freely appointed pursuant to the Constitution, those appointed following a selection process and those already serving to freely establish a trade union organization or association. These amendments will be submitted to the executive body for due study and consideration.\n.As regards the second part of the Committee s recommendation (c) concerning the allegation according to which, by virtue of Act No.  of , public servants dismissed and then reinstated through a ruling did not have the right to receive lost wages, the Government states that if a worker employed by a State institution is dismissed and reinstated, he or she immediately receives the salary and is paid any lost wages in keeping with the budget of each public institution. Should this prove to be insufficient, budgetary funds may be raised to pay the corresponding amount.\n.As regards recommendation (d) concerning the non-recognition of the public servant organization FENASEP, the Government states that the Federation is not currently registered as such according to the records of legal personality of the Department of Social Organizations, the General Labour Department of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Development (MITRADEL). FENASEP was established and granted legal personality by the Ministry of the Interior in  but was subsequently regulated by Act No.  of , which governs public servants in the administrative careers system. Section  of the Labour Code provides as follows:Section . The provisions of this Code are of a public nature and are binding on all persons, whether individuals or juridical persons, corporations, farms and establishments that are located or established within the national territory. Public employees shall be governed by the norms of the administrative careers system, except in cases where it is expressly determined that the precepts of this Code shall apply thereto.\n.Similarly, on  April  the High Court of Justice ruled on a previous case involving the same parties, underlining, among other things, the following:Consequently, this High Court considers that the labour provisions contained in the Labour Code do not apply to the National Finance Corporation, given that is it a State body legally established by law and is therefore excluded from labour legislation in accordance with section  of the Labour Code and section  of Act No.  of  December  [...]\n.The Government adds that the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice endorsed the aforementioned ruling by a judicial decision taken on  May . Therefore, in view of this ruling, the MITRADEL is not acting arbitrarily by refusing to grant legal personality to a public sector federation, given that to do so would constitute an illegal act that could entail legal consequences for the administration when the highest judicial authority has already taken a decision on the matter. This is the reason why FENASEP is not recognized and not because of an arbitrary decision on the part of the Government or the Minister for Labour as alleged by the complainants. The Government must abide by the principle of legality and the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice.\n.As regards the refusal to allocate education insurance funds to FENASEP for training, the Government states that it is waiting for the Third Administrative Division of the Supreme Court of Justice to provide clarification on the matter.\n.The Government adds that it is examining the possibility of setting up a bipartite forum for dialogue between the Ministry of Labour and FENASEP representatives in order to address and resolve issues relating to the public sector.\n.As regards the Committee s recommendation (e) concerning the alleged freezing of  requests for trade union registration, the Government states that this allegation is entirely false, given that the denial of legal personality to trade unions in the process of being established stemmed from their failure to meet the relevant legal requirements, which was communicated via reasoned administrative decisions.
