0,".The complaint is included in communications provided by the Workers' Union of the Campinas Municipal Services and National Confederation of Public Municipal Employees (CSPM), dated  April and  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  April and  July , the complainant organizations indicate that the President of the Republic approved, on  March , Provisional Measure (PM) No. /, amending the Consolidation of Labour Laws (CLT) and directly impacting the unions' funding model. The complainant organizations indicate that the PM drastically changes the way in which union contributions are raised, making it impossible to deduct trade union dues at source for workers, and allege that this has a significant impact on the organization and performance of the unions. The complainant organizations indicate that the PM amends sections , , , A and  of the CLT and allege that the main changes that will negatively affect the unions are the following:the measure makes it impossible to directly deduct union contributions or dues at source for workers, determining that the collection of union dues will be made exclusively by means of a deposit slip or electronic equivalent, which the union must send to the employee at home or, where this is not possible, to the enterprise s headquarters. The complainant organizations allege that the fact that direct deduction cannot be made from the worker s wage will have a drastic effect on the system for collecting union dues, which will become more bureaucratic and significantly more onerous, since it will be necessary to issue receipts through the banking system, which represents a financial and time-consuming cost for the trade union organizations that may even exceed the income from the funds raised; andthe measure requires the prior, individual, express and written authorization of the worker for the collection of trade union contributions, determining that any clause to the contrary is null and void, even if authorized by collective bargaining.
.The complainant organizations allege that the new requirements imposed by the PM will make the collection of trade union contributions extremely difficult and will therefore directly affect trade unions in the very sensitive areas of their financial management and income generation, thus compromising their sustainability. They consider that the restriction proposed by the PM not only affects the freedom and collective autonomy of trade unions, but also directly affects the autonomy and power of individual self-determination of the worker, who is prevented from having the contribution he or she chose to make deducted from source. They also allege that the PM was issued without prior consultation with workers' and employers' representatives and that its content not only implies an anti-union position, but also constitutes an anti-democratic practice that restricts the collective rights and freedoms of trade unions, as well as the individual rights and freedoms of workers.
.The complainant organizations indicate that in November , Act No. . (labour reform) was approved, amending several provisions of the CLT and incorporating new provisions into the legal text. The amended provisions include the above-mentioned sections  and . The complainant organizations indicate that prior to the labour reform, these sections provided that union contributions were mandatory and that, since the reform, union contributions have become optional and dependent on the worker s authorization.
.The complainant organizations indicate that, although several unions throughout the country filed actions with the national courts and succeeded in suspending the effects of the PM, maintaining the possibility of deducting union dues at source for their members, most of the hearings have not reached the second instance and there is, therefore, no uniform jurisprudential interpretation concerning this issue. Lastly, the complainant organizations indicate that the provisional measures, such as the one in question, are issued as a matter of urgency and are discontinued if the text is not approved by National Congress within a period of  days, which may be extended. They indicate that the PM in question ceased to have effect on  June  owing to the absence of legal regulation by the Congress, which is why it is no longer in force in the national legal system. The complainant organizations emphasize, however, that the discussion on the prohibition of deducting union contributions at source is ongoing at the national level.
.In its communication dated  August , the Government sent its observations and indicated that, above all, the relevance and urgency of the adoption of the PM must be understood. The Government recalls that on  July , Act No. . was adopted and indicates that, prior to the entry into force of this Act, union dues were mandatory by law. However, since it has been in force, union dues, formerly known as union taxes, became optional, depending on the prior and express consent of the worker. The Government explains that, although the logic enshrined in this Act, in terms of the need for the prior and express consent of the worker, was well defined in the provisions related to the union dues, there were still issues to be clarified. This included, for example, whether such consent could be given through a general assembly held in the trade union or in the scope of collective bargaining. The Government indicates that the Executive Branch decided to make this logic even more explicit through the PM in question.
.The Government cites paragraphs  and  of the explanatory statement that accompanies the PM, which indicate that: (i) while Act No. . was in force and the Federal Supreme Court had ruled on the constitutionality of the termination of the mandatory trade union tax, various strategies had been used without respecting the will of the legislator, such as collective bargaining and collective assemblies; and (ii) the prior authorization of the worker to which the Act refers must necessarily be individual, express and written, and the rule or clause establishing the mandatory payment of union dues is null and void, even where it is endorsed by collective bargaining, general assembly or any other means.
.The Government indicates that, according to data provided by the Labour Secretariat of the Ministry of the Economy, , collective instruments containing clauses related to the payment of union dues were deposited in . The Government indicates that workers, both members and non-members of the unions, who had signed these collective agreements were subject to the rules contained in those clauses, even if they had not expressly agreed to any deduction to their remuneration. The Government considers that the countless workers who were to be affected by the deduction of union dues with which they did not agree needed to be protected immediately, and that there was, therefore, an urgent need for a PM to clarify these issues. The Government indicates that the provisions amended by the PM act as an important step in reflecting the will of the Legislative Branch by having approved Act No. ./.
.The Government emphasizes that the collective clauses that establish contributions for a union body, in any capacity, making them mandatory for non-unionized workers, are against the right to freedom of association and to organize, guaranteed by the Constitution and, therefore, are null and void, as the contributions may be refunded, by the unions' own means, potentially deducting the respective amounts. The Government considers that the discussion on the compatibility of the Constitution with the imposition of a mandatory contribution, through a collective contract or agreement, on workers who are not members of the respective union, is undeniably important from a legal, economic and social perspective, since it potentially raises the issue for all employees who are not members of unions, and also has an impact on the organization of the Brazilian trade union system and its funding modalities.
.The Government mentions that the Federal Supreme Court itself, in binding ruling No. , concluded that  the contribution referred to in article , paragraph IV, of the Federal Constitution, is applicable only to members of the respective trade union'  and that the Court determined that the establishment, by accord, collective agreement or standard, of mandatory contributions imposed on non-unionized workers is unconstitutional. The Court considers that the clause contained in an accord, collective agreement or standard establishing a contribution of any kind, to a union body, is a contravention of the freedom protected by the Constitution if non-unionized workers are required to pay it.
.The Government considers it necessary to distinguish between the trade union contribution provided for in the Constitution (article , final part of paragraph IV) and established by law (section  of the CLT) for professional categories and constituting a tax, with a mandatory logo, from the so-called assistance contribution, also known as the assistance fee. It",-1,2019,Brazil
1,"indicates that the aim of the latter is to fund the union s assistance activities, mainly in the course of collective bargaining, and does not constitute a tax. It also emphasizes that the bank receipt or electronic equivalent is a logical consequence as it serves to defend those who do not wish to contribute financially to trade union bodies and is therefore a measure that may safeguard the principle of freedom of association enshrined in article , paragraph V, of the Federal Constitution of , which provides that no one is obliged to join or remain a member of a trade union.
.The Government considers that the provisions presented in the PM only provide greater legal certainty to social actors, especially by emphasizing the need to comply with the principle of freedom of association, without neglecting the necessary interplay with the content of Act No. ./. The Government indicates, however, that the PM ceased to be in force as of  June  because the term expired without it having been reviewed in the Legislative Branch.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns PM No. , approved by the President of the Republic on  March , amending several sections of the CLT and providing that: (i) trade union contributions or fees cannot be deducted at source (the trade union must send a deposit slip to the worker who must pay the contribution at a bank); and (ii) the prior, individual, express and written authorization of the worker for the collection of the trade union dues and any clause setting out otherwise shall be null and void, even if a collective bargaining agreement exists.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that: (i) the PM, issued without prior consultation with workers' and employers' representatives, will make the collection of union dues extremely difficult and will have an impact on the unions' income generation, thus compromising their sustainability; and ( ii) although several unions filed actions and succeeded in suspending the effects of the PM, maintaining the possibility of deducting union dues at source for their members, most of the hearings have not reached the second instance.
.The Committee notes that in this respect the Government indicates that: (i) since the reform introduced by Act No. ./, trade union contributions ceased to be mandatory and became optional; (ii) although the above Act refers to the need for the prior and express consent of the worker, questions remained to be clarified, such as whether such consent could be given through a general assembly held in the trade union or in the scope of collective bargaining; (iii) the Executive Branch decided to make this logic more explicit through the PM; (iv) , collective instruments containing clauses related to the payment of union dues were deposited in  and workers were subject to the rules contained therein, even if they had not expressly agreed to any deduction to their remuneration, and there was an urgent need for a PM to clarify these issues; and (v) the bank receipt or electronic equivalent is a logical consequence as it serves to defend those who do not wish to contribute financially to trade unions.
.The Committee, while recalling that the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided and that the issue of the deduction of trade union dues by employers and their transfer to trade unions is a matter which should be dealt with through collective bargaining between employers and all trade unions without legislative obstruction, [see Compilation of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, sixth edition, , paragraphs  and ], takes due note that, as indicated by the complainant organizations and the Government, the PM ceased to be in force as of  June  and therefore invites the Governing Body to decide that this case is closed and does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2019,Brazil
2,".The complaint is contained in the communication dated  December  from Public Services International (PSI), the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT), the New Trade Union Confederation of Workers (NCST), the General Union of Workers (UGT), the Confederation of Brazilian Trade Unions (CSB), the Confederation of Workers of Brazil (CTB), Fora Sindical (FS), the People s Trade Union Confederation (CONLUTAS), Intersindical, the Confederation of Public Servants of Brazil (CSPB), the Confederation of Federal Public Service Workers (CONDSEF), the Confederation of Municipal Public Service Workers (CONFETAM/CUT), the National Confederation of CUT Social Security Workers (CNTSS/CUT), the National Federation of State Judiciary Workers (FENAJUD), the Trade Union Federation of Brazilian University Workers (FASUBRA), the National Federation of Urban Service Workers (FNU), and the Trade Union of Employees in Science, Technology, Production and Innovation in Public Health (ASFOC-SN).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  December , the complainants report non-compliance with the obligations arising from Convention No. , in particular with regard to the lack of legislation to promote and regulate collective bargaining in the public sector, as well as legislation establishing adequate protections against anti-union discrimination. Specifically, the complainants allege that the President of the Republic unduly vetoed the Bill (No. /) on collective bargaining in the public sector that had been drawn up in consultation with the social partners.
.The complainants state that: (i) although it has ratified Convention No. , the State is not fully implementing it, arguing that this would require a law governing collective bargaining for public servants; (ii) collective bargaining in the public sector faces many obstacles, such as the need for authorization from a higher authority and the limitations of the Fiscal Responsibility Act; (iii) as a result, the authorities tend to impose working conditions unilaterally; (iv) without recourse to collective bargaining, the trade unions use strikes to put pressure on the authorities, which run on indefinitely (the complainants note that in the first half of ,  of the  strikes that took place were in the public sector, and they also regret that the Federal Supreme Court decided that the administration should discount strike days from salaries ' even though the Constitutional Court had maintained the possibility for the parties to negotiate compensation for the days of stoppage); (v) there are very few existing examples of collective bargaining and, although this supports the argument that the promotion of collective bargaining does not rely on legislative developments, their existence and effectiveness vary depending on who is in Government; (vi) the establishment of the Permanent National Negotiating Table in  is illustrative of this ' the complainants regret that, in addition to its structural and bureaucratic limitations, it is emptied out every time the country experiences a political change, its results are limited and irregular, and the agreements are not always complied with, which triggers more strikes; and (vii) more recently, there has been a tendency to restrict freedom of association in the public sector, as demonstrated by the limitation of collective bargaining that culminated in the veto of the Bill (No. /) intended to regulate the exercise of collective bargaining in that sector.
.In that regard, the complainants note that: (i) seven years after the ratification of Convention No. , the National Congress finally passed a Bill regulating collective bargaining in the public sector (Bill No. /), which was transmitted for the approval of the President of the Republic on  November ; (ii) since , when the Bill was presented to the Senate, several public audiences have been held, with broad participation from trade union confederations, federations, trade unions and associations of public sector workers; (iii) considering the high level of legislative and social coordination around the text, it was expected to be approved in its entirety, nonetheless, on  December , the President of the Republic vetoed it entirely, and the veto was upheld by the Chamber of Deputies on  April , which meant that the Bill was definitively shelved; and (iv) the sophistry contained in the presidential veto lacks any legal basis (although the veto argued that there was a lack of legislative jurisdiction, it is not true to say that the Bill, which covered general procedural standards, encroached upon the jurisdiction of the states; neither did the Bill concern matters reserved for the legislative initiative of the President of the Republic, as the veto also argued).
.In a communication dated  August , the Government sent its reply to the allegations made by the complainants. The Government states that: (a) although the Federal Constitution guarantees freedom of association for public servants, the trade union rights of those public servants still lack specific legislation, in particular with regard to collective bargaining in the public sector; (b) on the other hand, in spite of not having specific legislation, negotiations do take place in the sector and there are various examples of this ' the creation of the Permanent National Negotiating Table, the main goal of which was to be a permanent negotiating system within the federal system; the Permanent Negotiating System for Efficiency in the Provision of Municipal Public Services in So Paulo (SINP); and the Permanent National Negotiating Table for the Single Health System (MNNP-SUS), as a forum of equals and of negotiating procedures to deal with conflicts and requests emanating from the Single Health System; (c) every legislative proposal must respect all the procedures set out in the legal system and, with regard to Bill No. /, on the understanding that the necessary formal procedures had not been followed, the President of the Republic at the time considered it appropriate to veto the Bill; (d) nonetheless, Brazil continues to believe that the regulations of Convention No.  are of great importance to the country and, therefore, the Federal Senate is considering a new proposal on the matter ' a new Bill (Bill No. /), the main scope of which is the establishment of general standards for collective bargaining in public service; and (e) it is worth highlighting that the new Ministry of the Economy has created a specific department to propose policies, standards and procedures relating to labour relations in the federal public service, since its jurisdiction includes the need to promote the administration s participation in dialogue with bodies representing the interests of public servants and to propose measures to resolve conflicts that arise in matters of labour relations during the negotiation of working conditions. In conclusion, the Government affirms the country s interest in establishing standard-setting mechanisms in order to better implement Convention No.  in its internal legal system and notes that, while it is seeking to harmonize its regulatory framework, negotiations will be undertaken by other means, such as the aforementioned tables.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns the development of legislative measures to give effect to the provisions of Convention No. , in particular with regard to collective bargaining and protection against anti-union discrimination in the public sector.
.The Committee notes that, although the complainants report a lack of adequate legislation and allege that the President of the Republic unduly vetoed a Bill (No. /) on collective bargaining in the public sector that had been drawn up in consultation with the social partners; on the other hand, the Government notes that the regulations of Convention No.  are of great importance to the country and a new Bill is being considered by the Senate (Bill No. /) with a view to establishing general standards for collective bargaining in public service.
.In these circumstances and emphasizing the importance of social dialogue, the Committee encourages the authorities concerned to continue consulting with the social partners, in the hope that the legislation in question will be adopted very soon. Since Brazil has ratified Conventions Nos.  and , the Committee refers the legislative aspects of the case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee encourages the authorities concerned to continue consulting with the social partners, in the hope that the legislation in question will be adopted very soon.(b)	The Committee refers the legislative aspects of the case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",-1,2018,Brazil
3,".The complaint is contained in the communication received on  June  from the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT) and the Single Confederation of Oil Workers (FUP).
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  April  and  February .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication received on  June , the complainants denounce the imposition of fines for exercising the right to strike that exceed the trade unions' capacity to pay. They allege in particular that:(i)	a day before a strike that was called by a number of trade unions in the petroleum sector for  and  May and  June , on  May , the State (Unio) and the enterprise with public participation, Petrleo Brasileiro, S.A. (henceforth, the oil company) filed an action for annulment of the strike, alleging its abusive nature and its political and ideological motivation; and requested that the work of all workers in the oil company and its subsidiaries be ensured, failing which a fine of ,, Brazilian reals (approximately US$,) would be imposed, and that the trade unions refrain from preventing the free movement of goods and persons (or face a fine of same amount);(ii)	the competent judge of the Supreme Labour Court issued a decision on the same day,  May , ordering the trade unions to refrain from holding the strike or be fined , reals (approximately US$,) per day as it deemed the strike to be of an apparently abusive nature. The judge based the decision on the following grounds: the strike was of a political nature; such strikes had no basis in the prevailing jurisprudence of the collective disputes department of the Supreme Labour Court; a collective labour agreement signed between the social actors was in force until ; and, in the judge s view, the strike bordered on opportunism, was organized to cause disturbance and was void of all sensitivity as it would cause potentially serious damage to the population;(iii)	the judge was mistaken in considering the strike was of a merely political nature and that, beyond the issue of the nature of the strike, holding a strike to express discontent regarding certain regulations affecting the workers' rights is legal. The decision to call the strike had five objectives: () reduction of fuel and cooking gas prices; () preservation of jobs, and resumption of domestic fuel production; () cessation of the importation of petrol and other oil derivatives; () action against privatization and the dismantling of the employer system; and () resignation of the Chairperson of the company. While the court decision cited these objectives, it failed to conclude, in its interpretation, that the strike sought to preserve the jobs and the public company. The movement was driven by both trade unionists as well as workers, citizens and consumers, which did not undermine the legitimacy of the strike. The planned action cannot be considered a purely political strike, disconnected from the world of work and the productive sector concerned;(iv)	having carried out the strike on  May , the same Supreme Labour Court judge, highlighting the alleged incompliance with the prior court order, quadrupled the amount of the daily fine initially set, which rose to ,, reals (approximately US$,). The complainants allege that this court decision prevented the effective exercise of the right to strike; and(v)	while fuel and gas production and distribution services are mentioned in article () of Act No. /, they are not subject to an absolute restriction on striking. Rather, in these sectors, the right to strike is guaranteed insofar as trade unions, employers and workers ensure, through common agreement during the strike, the provision of essential services to meet the basic needs of the community. In the strike in question, the workers' organizations had given these guarantees.
.The complainants refer to Case No. , which the Committee had previously examined, concerning excessive sanctions for exercising the right to strike in the same oil company. In this case, the Committee considered that the sanctions must be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement committed and must in no case compromise the continuation of the activities of the parties thus sanctioned, and highlighted that strikes should not be subject to fines. Warning of the intimidating and inhibitive effect of the amount of the fines (US$, per day of strike), the Committee considered, in that case, that the imposition of fines for exercising the right to strike was not consistent with the principles of freedom of association and requested the Government to take measures to ensure that the fines were annulled.
.To conclude, the complainants consider that in the present case the judicial authorities imposed fines that were both inappropriate and excessive with respect to the legal exercise of the right to strike which, as they exceeded the trade unions' financial capacity, compromised their survival.
.In a communication of  April , the Government sent its reply to the complainants' allegations through a legal brief from the Office of the Attorney General of the Union, which relays the court decision issued on  may  ordering the organizations concerned to refrain from carrying out the strike. The court ruling:(i)	verified, based on the information submitted, that the strike had five objectives: () reduction of fuel and cooking gas prices; () preservation of jobs, and resumption of domestic fuel production; () cessation of the importation of petrol and other oil derivatives; () action against privatization and the dismantling of the employer system; and () resignation of the Chairperson of the company;(ii)	considered, in view of the abovementioned, that the strike was of a political nature, and that void of all sensitivity, it was carried out to cause disturbance; the strike had an essentially political agenda and a strong interference not only in the management of Petrobras, but also in its own public policy actions, which affected the whole country and which couldn t be resolved under pressure of a professional category;(iii)	highlighted that the claims did not refer to the working conditions of the company s employees and that a collective bargaining agreement entered into with the social partners was still in force until . In this regard, it stressed that the employer, though it suffered the effects of the stoppage, was unable to resolve such claims, which concerned the public authorities;(iv)	also observed that the strike was planned at a time when the country was emerging from a truckers' strike which had caused serious economic damage in the country and considered that the damage was potentially serious as it may have prolonged the harmful effects caused by the truckers' strike;(v)	considered, in this sense that: the announced strike revealed a strong and combative sector and that.. an eventual strike in the oil sector would entail a potentially serious harm for the Brazilian population, as it would imply a continuation of the damages caused by the truckers' strike;he strike bordered opportunism and its outbreak was not proportionate to the aims that, in theory, could be achieved with the pursued agenda and the sacrifice of society; and(vi)	in light of the apparently abusive nature of the strike and the serious damage that it could entail, ordered the trade unions to refrain from holding the strike and blocking the free movement of goods and persons, or be fined , reals (approximately US$,).
.Having transcribed the aforementioned court ruling, the Attorney General s Office highlights that:(i)	the complaint challenges a court ruling issued independently and in conformity with the guarantee of an impartial judge, so that the complainant s allegations question the sovereignty of judicial decisions;(ii)	the complainants sought to undermine the judiciary by not respecting the decision taken; furthermore, the complainants filed appeals which are still pending and thus the complaint before the ILO is aimed at limiting the independence of the national jurisdiction;(iii)	the right to strike is not absolute and its reasonableness and proportionality must be evaluated with regard to the impact of the strike on other rights and interests;(iv)	the proposed strike was intransigent and insensitive, and did not seek to defend the occupational or economic interests of the oil sector workers. In light of the five objectives quoted, it is clear that the objective was rather to sow chaos in the country and destabilize the entire political, economic and judicial system, as well as to upset citizens' safety and well-being;(v)	the organizations did not fulfil the requirements established under Act No. /, including prior collective bargaining (a collective agreement had been in force until August ), public notice of an assembly, or description of how essential services would be provided;(vi)	a dispute between professionals and employers must not completely undermine the interests of society and, following the principles of reasonableness and proportionality, the effective impact of the exercise of the strike on other fundamental rights and interests must be assessed;(vii) in another court decision concerning a truckers' strike which was also considered abusive (the strike consisted of driving at reduced speed and occupying several",-1,2018,Brazil
4,"lanes to slow down traffic), The Federal Supreme Court recalled that the compatibility between fundamental rights must be examined in the light of criteria of reasonableness and proportionality. The Court considered that in the case of the truckers' strike there was abuse, as it found that the strike had a disproportionate and intolerable effect on the rest of society, causing the interruption of fuel and inputs to provide essential public services; and(viii)	by quoting in their complaint one paragraph of the Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, which indicates that the oil sector does not constitute an essential service in the strict sense of the term, the CUT and FUT, seek to question, with the possible aim of modifying or repealing it, Article () of Act No. /, which establishes that services in the oil sector are essential services, without due compliance with the legal process or without any ruling of unconstitutionality on the above-mentioned provision by the judiciary.
.In a communication dated  February , in addition to reiterating the elements contained in its previous communication, the Government refers to the social context in which the public authorities decided to file a legal action to prevent the start of the strike in the present case. The Government states that on  May , a truck drivers' strike was declared and that it lasted  days. The truck drivers blocked roads and prevented the circulation of even essential goods. Services such as fuel supply and distribution of food and medical supplies were paralysed. The main demand of the truckers was a reduction in the price of diesel, which was met by the Federal Government. In view of this scenario of social commotion and insofar as the company is the main producer and distributor of fuel in the country, the Federal Government resorted to the courts to prevent further substantial damage to society and the country. The Government states that the above reasons show that the legal action initiated to prevent the strike in the oil sector was not hasty but was intended to prevent this second strike from leading the country into chaos.
.The Government also refers to the consideration of the right to strike by the Brazilian legal system. The Government indicates in this respect that: (i) article  of the Federal Constitution recognizes the right to strike as a fundamental right; (ii) at the same time, the Constitution itself (article .) recognizes that the right to strike is not absolute and that it must coexist with the other fundamental rights, that the perpetrators of abuses committed during strikes must be punished in accordance with the law and that it is up to the legislator to define the essential activities that are indispensable to the community and in respect of which the exercise of the right to strike is conditioned; (iii) based on these constitutional principles, Law No. / regulates the exercise of the right to strike; (iv) this law defines in particular the essential activities for the community that must be attended even in case of strike, conditioning but not prohibiting the strike in the sectors concerned; (v) the law establishes some requirements for the validity of the strike movement, such as: the existence of a real attempt to negotiate, before the strike takes place, the approval by the respective assembly of workers, the prior notice to the employer, which in essential activities must occur within  hours of the strike; and (vi) the above-mentioned law defines the existence of an abuse of the right to strike when its rules are not complied with or when the strike is maintained after the conclusion of an agreement or after a decision of the labour justice system. The Government states that in the present case: (i) the union did not comply with the formal requirements contained in the law (existence of collective bargaining, meeting of a union assembly and strike notice); (ii) the union could not call a strike as there was a collective agreement in force for the category until  August  and the claims had no relation whatsoever with the clauses of the agreement in force; and (iii) the Federal Government s legal action sought to avoid possible damage to the population which had already been suffering for more than a week with the interruption of essential services resulting from the truck drivers' strike.
.The Committee notes that in the complaint the complainants denounce that, after having called a three-day strike that fulfilled the legal requirements, at the request of the State and the oil company, a court decision was issued that prohibited the strike and prevented it by imposing fines that exceeded the trade unions' capacity to pay and compromised their survival. On the other hand, the Committee observes that the Government, after describing the social context in which the strike in question was initiated and recalling the constitutional and legal guidelines governing the right to strike, states that the strike was of a political nature and was held to cause disturbance, that it did not fulfil the legal requirements, that a collective agreement was in force and that the formal conditions for declaring a strike had not been respected. The Committee notes that the Government also states that the strike: (i) entailed the risk of significant damage, particularly since a truckers' strike had recently taken place; and (ii) taking into consideration that the company is the main fuel producer and distributor in the country, the Federal Government s action sought to avoid throwing the country into chaos after more than a week of interruption of essential services due to the truckers' strike.
.In this regard, the Committee notes, that: (i), through a court decision of an independent judicial body, it was found that the strike was political and abusive, and the trade unions were ordered to refrain from carrying out the strike or be fined; and (ii), as they did not comply with the court decision, the same court imposed in the first instance a higher fine of ,, reals per day of strike (approximately US$,). While noting divergences between the parties as to whether minimum services had been established, the Committee notes that the judicial body ordered the organizations concerned to refrain from paralysing activities in light of its qualification of the strike as political, without considering the issue of minimum services. The Committee also notes that in its considerations, the judicial decision alluded not only to the political nature of the strike, but also to the potentially serious harm that its exercise could entail for the population, in particular because it could imply a continuation of the damage caused by a previous truckers' strike and that its scope was not proportionate to the aims it pursued and to the sacrifice of the society in order to achieve those aims.
.The Committee also notes that, following an appeal filed by the trade union organizations against the aforementioned judicial decision of first instance, the Supreme Labour Court, in a decision issued on  December : (i) confirmed the first-instance decision considering the strike abusive because it was eminently political in nature and that it had ostensibly disregarded the initial judicial determination to abstain from the strike; and (ii) it reduced the fine from ,, reals to an amount of , reals for each trade union organization, observing that the strike had lasted one and a half days of the three initially planned and taking into account the financial capacities of the trade unions.
.On the nature of the strike, the Committee notes that, as it was alleged by both parties, the strike had five objectives: () reduction of fuel and cooking gas prices; () preservation of jobs, and resumption of domestic fuel production; () cessation of the importation of petrol and other oil derivatives; () action against privatization and the dismantling of the employer system; and () resignation of the Chairperson of the company.
.The Committee notes in this regard that: (i) national legislation (Law , of ) establishes the conditions for the exercise of the right to strike and in particular provides that the labour courts shall decide on the total or partial admissibility or inadmissibility of the claims (article ); (ii) the legislation provides that the production and distribution of fuels is an essential service, conditioning the exercise of the right to strike in said sector to the obligation that trade unions, employers and workers guarantee, by mutual agreement, the provision of essential services to meet the unavoidable needs of the communities (articles ,  and ); (iii) the legislation provides that unavoidable needs are those that, if not met, would endanger the survival, health or safety of the population (sole paragraph of article ); (iv) the legislation establishes that the exercise of the right to strike is abusive if the law is not observed when the stoppage continues after the conclusion of an agreement, collective agreement or judicial decision on labor (article ); and (v) in the present case, both in the first and second instance,",-1,2018,Brazil
5,"the national courts have determined that the strike at issue was eminently political in nature and consequently considered it abusive.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that while it has considered that to determine situations in which a strike could be prohibited, the criterion which has to be established is the existence of a clear and imminent threat to the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population, [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], it has also considered that what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country. Moreover, this concept is not absolute, in the sense that a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population [see Compilation para. ].
.While observing that the Brazilian legislation provides for guarantees for the exercise of a strike and measures to resolve disputes through an independent judicial body and that the right to strike is not absolute, can be restricted in essential services in the strict sense of the term, including to meet the unavoidable needs of the communities, the Committee also recalls that the occupational and economic interests which workers defend through the exercise of the right to strike do not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature, but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social policy questions and problems facing the undertaking which are of direct concern to the workers. In addition, the Committee recalls that the right to strike should not be limited solely to industrial disputes that are likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement; workers and their organizations should be able to express in a broader context, if necessary, their dissatisfaction as regards economic and social matters affecting their members interests [see Compilation, paras  and ].
.In view of the above, the Committee considers that in addition to judicial decisions on this matter, the situation should be examined in light of the circumstances of time, manner and place, in order to assess the reasons put forward. The Committee recalls that while purely political strikes do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association, trade unions should be able to have recourse to protest strikes, in particular where aimed at criticizing a government s economic and social policies [see Compilation, para. ]. At the same time, the Committee recalls that it does not have the authority to interpret the scope of national legislation, which falls to the national competent authorities and ultimately the courts [see Compilation, para. ].
.With regard to the sanctions denounced by the complainants, the Committee notes that in the case under examination, they were linked to the non-compliance with a judicial decision ordering to refrain from strike action which if not implemented would result in a daily fine and that the trade unions concerned, which could resort to an appeal body to enforce their claims, were responsible for complying with the decision issued by independent judicial bodies. The Committee observes, on the other hand, that the complainants denounce the inappropriate and excessive character of the fines issued, which, exceeding the trade unions' financial capacity, compromised their survival.
.In this regard, the Committee recalls that, in the past, it examined the issue of the imposition of excessive fines for an allegedly abusive strike in the same petroleum company, where the Committee had recalled that the imposition of sanctions, including fines, on the social partners in the case of infringement of labour legislation is not in itself a matter of objection; however, such sanctions must be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement committed and must in no case compromise the continuation of the activities of the parties thus sanctioned [see the th Report, Case No.  of March , paras ' ].
.While noting that the fines initially issued (approximately US$, per day of strike in the decision prior to the initiation of the strike and US$, in the decision of first instance following the initiation of the strike) were very high and likely to have a disproportionate impact on the life of the unions concerned, the Committee notes that, in the second instance, the Supreme Labor Court significantly reduced the amount of the fines imposed and the final amount (of approximately US$, for each trade union) was based on the short duration of the strike and the financial capacity of the unions. Observing that the legislation may establish the parameters in this matter, and in light of the points previously mentioned, the Committee invites the Government to submit the issue of fines imposed for the abusive exercise of the right to strike for tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, which do not call for further examination, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Observing that the legislation may establish the parameters in this matter, and in light of the points highlighted in the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Government to submit the issue of fines imposed for the abusive exercise of the right to strike for tripartite dialogue with the most representative organizations.",-1,2018,Brazil
6,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' ].
.The Union of Judiciary Employees of Maranho State (SINDJUS-MA) submitted further information in communications dated  July  and  February . The National Federation of State Judiciary Workers (FENAJUD) provided additional information in a communication dated  October . The complainant organizations, including the Confederation of Public Servants of Brazil (CSPB), provided further information through a joint communication dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September ,  February  and  March .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations [see Report No. , para. ]:(a)	With regard to the alleged lack of independence of the courts of Minas Gerais State that are examining the defamation cases against the Union of Judiciary Employees of Minas Gerais State (SERJUSMIG), the Committee requests the Government to report on the different options in terms of remedies available to that trade union organization with respect to the substance of the decisions handed down.(b)	Noting that, according to the information received, the defamation proceedings filed in  against SERJUSMIG have so far given rise only to a preliminary decision, the Committee trusts that the judicial proceedings under way will be completed as soon as possible and that the decisions by the Committee mentioned in the conclusions of this case will be duly taken into consideration. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(c)	Noting that it has not yet received the Government s reply on the administrative disciplinary proceedings that were allegedly brought against nine judiciary employees who participated in SERJUSMIG s campaign over wages, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard as soon as possible.(d)	Noting that the Government has not provided its observations on the allegations concerning the dispute between the Union of Judiciary Employees of Maranho State (SINDJUS-MA) and the Judicial Authority of Maranho State, the Committee requests the Government to send its reply in this regard as soon as possible.
.In its communication of  October , FENAJUD provides updated elements on the judicial and administrative disciplinary proceedings filed against the Union of Judiciary Employees of Minas Gerais State (SERJUSMIG). As regards the lawsuits filed by the Association of Minas Gerais Magistrates (AMAGIS) and the then president of the Court of Justice of Minas Gerais (TJMG) against SERJUSMIG, its then president and five judiciary employees of the Minas Gerais State, the complainant informs that settlements were reached and judicially homologated between July and October . With regard to the administrative disciplinary proceedings, it indicates that, in view of the lapse of time, the statute of limitations was declared and, as a result, the employees were not punished. Therefore, the administrative proceedings against Jamilce Polliana Aguilar Silva, Dagma Geralda Batista, Ana Elisa Bittencourt Fonseca, Andr Rodrigues Damaceno, Luciene Peracci, Karina Kerley Porto, Josu Ribeiro Roberto, Darci Eduardo Dias and Mara Cristina Fonseca are now closed. In light of the above, the complainant, citing ethical and moral reasons and the fact that the conflict no longer exists, states that it is no longer necessary to proceed with the present case and requests its termination in view of the resolution of the conflict.
.In its communication of  July , SINDJUS-MA refers to the dispute between the judiciary employees of Maranho State and the Court of Justice of that State, in particular the salary deductions and the fine of . million Brazilian reals (BRL), which resulted from a strike that was declared illegal by the Court of Justice of Maranho State. It requests that a conciliation hearing be provided, so that an agreement may be found on the salaries deductions and the penalty imposed on SINDJUS-MA due to strike movements may be terminated. In its second communication, of  February , SINDJUS-MA emphasizes the urgency of the case as the survival of the union would be at stake and denounces the situation of serious vulnerability to anti-union conduct to which the workers would be exposed in Brazil.
.In a communication dated  September , the complainant organizations submitted a court decision dated  April  regarding an action brought by Anibal Lins, the then president of SINDJUS-MA, following public statements made against him by two magistrates of the Court of Justice of Maranho State. The Court's decision requires the State of Maranho to grant the union leader a right of reply proportionate to the harm suffered, the said right of reply having to take place in a plenary session of the court and be broadcast on web radio. The complainant organizations allege that this ruling demonstrates the hostility of the administration of justice representatives towards the trade union and its refusal to establish a dialogue with it.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government refers to the allegations concerning the Judicial Authority of Minas Gerais State. It reiterates that the union activities of SERJUSMIG were considered by AMAGIS as causing collective moral damage to the magistrates, which justified the filing of lawsuits. The Government indicates that the fundamental issue of this case has already been brought to the attention of the judiciary branch, which, in turn, has the responsibility to decide on the issue. It points out that, based on the principle of separation of powers that guides the country's legal system, the Secretariat of Labour Relations, an agency engaged in the executive branch, has no competence to break with the country s constitutional structure by interfering in the acts of another branch.
.In its communication of  February , the Government confirms that in Minas Gerais State, the parties entered into a transaction as to the object of the litigation. It also refers to the request of FENAJUD that the present case be terminated. The Government points out that not even in the administrative area was there any application of any penalty on the judiciary employees. According to the Government, it therefore cannot be disputed that the procedures relevant to the analysis of the cases are in full operation in Brazil, ruling out any misperception that the country is condoning anti-union practices.
.As regards the allegations concerning the situation occurring in Maranho State, the Government emphasizes that the dispute was brought to the attention of the judiciary branch. Underlining again that a suitable conclusion was found between the parties in litigation in Minas Gerais State, it believes that the same can occur regarding the litigation related to the public employees of the State of Maranho.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that in the State of Maranho, the salary deductions resulting from the strike days were upheld, even after the intermediary management of the National Council of Justice, where the judiciary employees proposed restituting the work hours lost in exchange for the suspension of the docking of the wages.
.The Committee recalls that the original complaint concerns two separate instances of alleged restrictions on freedom of association in the context of wage disputes in the judicial sector. It takes note of the additional information provided by the complainant organizations and the Government. As regards the allegations concerning the dispute between SERJUSMIG and the Judicial Authority of Minas Gerais, the Committee notes FENAJUD s indication that: (i) the lawsuits that were filed by AMAGIS and the then TJMG president against SERJUSMIG, its then president and five judiciary employees of the Minas Gerais State were settled between the parties; (ii) the administrative disciplinary proceedings against nine judiciary employees who participated in SERJUSMIG s campaign over wages were closed, as the statute of limitations was declared; and (iii) it is no longer necessary to proceed with the present case in view of the resolution of the conflict. The Committee also takes note that the Government indicates that: (i) the parties entered into a transaction as to the object of the litigation; (ii) FENAJUD requested that the present case be terminated; (iii) there was not an administrative penalty applied to the judiciary employees; and (iv) these developments prove that the procedures relevant to the analysis of the cases are in full operation in Brazil and that the country is not condoning any anti-union practices. Observing that the complainant and the Government both refer to a mutually agreed solution to the dispute that was found between the parties, the Committee will not pursue the examination of these allegations.
.Regarding the allegations concerning the dispute between SINDJUS-MA and the Judicial Authority of Maranho State, the Committee recalls that, in its initial communications, SINDJUS-MA alleged that: (i) after having declared the illegality of a  strike carried out by its own employees, the Court of Justice of the",-1,2017,Brazil
7,"Maranho State imposed a fine of BRL. million (approximately US$,), which threatens the survival of the union; (ii) without taking into consideration the solution proposed in May  by the National Council of Justice, the supervisory body of the Brazilian judicial system, the Court of Justice refused to allow the work that was suspended during the strike to be fulfilled through additional compensatory hours of work and rather docked all pay corresponding to the duration of the strike; and (iii) the Court of Justice of Maranho State engaged in anti-union acts and practices by refusing to receive union representatives and to enter into negotiations with the union in an attempt to discredit SINDJUS-MA as a representative of judiciary employees. The Committtee notes that in its additional communications, SINDJUS-MA: (i) requested a conciliation hearing with a view to ensure the refund of the pay that was lost by the employees and the cancellation of the fine imposed on the union; (ii) emphasized the urgency of the case and the need to prevent the punishments imposed on the union and the judiciary employees of Maranho State from becoming irreversible; and (iii) communicated a court ruling granting the then president of SINDJUS-MA a right of reply following public statements made against him by two magistrates of the Court of Justice of Maranho State that would demonstrate the hostility of the administration of justice representatives towards the trade union. The Committee further notes that the Government: (i) states that the salary deductions resulting from the strike days were upheld; (ii) emphasizes that the dispute was brought to the attention of the judiciary branch; and (iii) believes that a similar agreement to the one that was reached between parties in litigation in Minas Gerais State can be achieved in the State of Maranho.
.The Committee recalls that salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee notes, however, that the Government has not provided information on the fine of BRL. million that was imposed on SINDJUS-MA which would allegedly threaten the survival of the union. In this respect, the Committee recalls that it expects that any fines that could be imposed against trade unions for unlawful strikes will not be of an amount that is likely to lead to the dissolution of the union or to have an intimidating effect on trade unions and inhibit their legitimate trade union activities, and trusts that the Government would endeavour to resolve such situations by means of frank and genuine social dialogue [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee trusts that the Government will take the measures within its power to ensure that the fine imposed upon SINDJUS-MA by the Judicial Authority of Maranho State does not threaten the very survival of the union and invites it to bring the parties together to review this matter.
.The Committee also observes that the Government did not refer to the initial allegation that the Court of Justice of Maranho State would engage in anti-union acts and practices by refusing to receive union representatives and refusing to enter into negotiations with the union. It recalls that both employers and trade unions should bargain in good faith and make every effort to come to an agreement, and satisfactory labour relations depend primarily on the attitudes of the parties towards each other and on their mutual confidence [see Compilation, para. ]. Noting the Government s indication that a similar agreement to the one that was reached in Minas Gerais State may be achieved in Maranho State, the Committee trusts that the Government will seek to foster a climate of dialogue and trust between the parties with a view to reaching a negotiated agreement to end the dispute.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee trusts that the Government will take the necessary measures in its power to ensure that the fine imposed upon the Union of Judiciary Employees of Maranho State (SINDJUS-MA) by the Judicial Authority of Maranho State does not threaten the very survival of the union, and that it will seek to foster a climate of dialogue and trust between the parties with a view to reaching a negotiated agreement to end the dispute.(b) The Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination and is closed.
.The complaint is contained in two communications from the National Federation of State Judiciary Workers (FENAJUD) of  June and  September , and in a joint communication from FENAJUD, Public Services International (PSI) and the Union of Judiciary Employees of Maranho State (SINDJUS-MA) of  June .
.The Government sent observations in a communication of  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its initial communication, dated  June , FENAJUD alleges that, in the context of a union campaign carried out in mid- for the application of the annual wage adjustment to account for inflation that is provided for in the Federal Constitution, the Union of Judiciary Employees of Minas Gerais State (SERJUSMIG) was prohibited by the Court of Justice of Minas Gerais (TJMG) from exercising its freedom of association and expression. The complainant alleges specifically that: (i) for , the TJMG applied the wage adjustment to account for inflation only to its magistrates, without granting it to other court employees; (ii) in order to ensure the application of this adjustment, which is provided for in the Federal Constitution, SERJUSMIG launched a campaign of protest that included posting on a social network the cover of a widely circulated national magazine that reported the high wages received by the president of the TJMG and the dissemination of a poster that compared Minas Gerais magistrates with sharks; (iii) as a result of this campaign, SERJUSMIG and a number of employees faced various legal actions for defamation (one initiated by the Association of Minas Gerais Magistrates (AMAGIS) and two by the president of the TJMG), as well as administrative disciplinary proceedings; and (iv) by a preliminary decision of  August , a Minas Gerais judge ordered SERJUSMIG to withdraw all communications that were the subject of legal action and to refrain from publishing any communications containing pejorative references to the magistrates of Minas Gerais.
.In respect of the aforementioned judicial decision, the complainant first asserts that the substance of the decision is contrary to freedom of expression, to the principles of freedom of association and to the content of ILO Conventions Nos  and . In this regard, it states that: (i) the union s publications remained within the limits of freedom of expression; (ii) as for publishing the wages of the TJMG president, the union simply reproduced the cover of a widely circulated national magazine, which itself disseminated information that was not false (the TJMG president acknowledged the payment, specifying however that it was an occasional and not a monthly payment); and (iii) the right to criticize is inherent to freedom of association and therefore the censorship imposed by the judicial decision constitutes interference in the legitimate trade union activities of SERJUSMIG, contrary to Conventions Nos  and . To support its argument, the complainant refers to a letter from the administrative law professor Celso Antonio Bandeira de Mello, which defends the actions of SERJUSMIG in the context of the dispute in question as being entirely lawful and constitutional in nature.
.The complainant states, secondly, that the cases filed against SERJUSMIG s campaign by AMAGIS and the TJMG president should not be examined by the judicial bodies of the State of Minas Gerais, which lack the necessary independence to settle them, given the subject of the dispute and its direct relationship to the interests of the magistrates and to the actions of that state s judicial authority as the employer of the members of SERJUSMIG. The complainant regrets in this regard the lack of a judicial mechanism in Brazil that would allow the parties to obtain a transfer of jurisdiction in such cases.
.In a second communication, of  September , the complainant provides additional information on the initiation of administrative disciplinary proceedings against several judiciary employees of Minas Gerais State (Jamilce Polliana Aguilar Silva, Dagma Geralda Batista, Ana Elisa Bittencourt Fonseca, Andr Rodrigues Damaceno, Luciene Peracci, Karina Kerley Porto, Josu Ribeiro Roberto, Darci Eduardo Dias and Mara Cristina Fonseca) for disseminating the images mentioned above and for using a photo of the TJMG president as their profile picture in their personal social network accounts; it alleges in this respect that several irregularities occurred. The complainant states in particular that: (i) the initial application of the TJMG president to launch disciplinary proceedings against",-1,2017,Brazil
8,"the aforementioned persons was dismissed; (ii) the TJMG president lodged an administrative appeal against that dismissal, which was submitted to the Judicial Council of the TJMG, even though the president did not have the power to lodge such an appeal; (iii) after several procedural irregularities and, in particular, several changes in the composition of the Judicial Council with a view to obtaining a sufficient majority, on  July  the Judicial Council accepted the appeal by majority, giving its approval for disciplinary proceedings to be initiated against four employees (Jamilce Polliana Aguilar Silva, Dagma Geralda Batista, Ana Elisa Bittencourt Fonseca and Andr Rodrigues Damaceno); (iv) on  November , the Judicial Council handed down a similar decision with respect to the other aforementioned employees; and (v) pursuant to these decisions by the Judicial Council, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the aforementioned employees, who, in turn, submitted a series of legal appeals, in particular ordinary appeals, to the Superior Court of Justice.
.In a third communication, dated  June , FENAJUD, together with the PSI and SINDJUS-MA, present allegations concerning the dispute between the judiciary employees of Maranho State, represented by SINDJUS-MA, and the Court of Justice of that state, concerning the non-application of the annual wage adjustment to account for inflation that is provided for in the Federal Constitution. The complainant organizations state that, after having exhausted all possibilities for dialogue and having complied with all legal requirements, SINDJUS-MA carried out a strike from October to December . Despite several attempts to reach a compromise, the court refused to allow the work that had been suspended during the strike to be fulfilled through compensatory hours of work, and it docked all pay corresponding to the duration of the strike. The complainant organizations state that this position is contrary to that adopted in  by the Superior Court of Justice, when a strike was carried out by the employees of that court, and that the Superior Court of Justice is of a higher instance than the Court of Justice of Maranho State. The Superior Court of Justice, instead of docking the pay corresponding to the strike period, had decided that additional unpaid hours of work should be fulfilled to make up for lost time. The complainant organizations state that this was also the solution proposed in May  in relation to the dispute that is the subject of the present complaint by the National Council of Justice, the supervisory body of the Brazilian judicial system, but that the Court of Justice of Maranho State ignored this compromise proposal.
.The complainant organizations further state that, despite the legitimacy of the action, the court declared the strike illegal and imposed a fine of . million Brazilian reals (BRL) on the union, which amounts to more than the sum of the union s assets and which, if applied, would threaten the very survival of the union. The complainant organizations add that this sentence poses a difficulty in that, in this case, the court handing down the sentence was also the employer of the striking workers.
.The organizations also claim that the Court of Justice of Maranho State engages in anti union acts and practices by refusing to receive union representatives and refusing to enter into negotiations with the union. They claim that, on countless occasions, the applications for a hearing made by SINDJUS-MA were ignored by the Desembargador Corregedor (second-instance judge inspector) of that court, in an attempt to discredit SINDJUS-MA as a representative of judiciary employees.
.In a communication of  May , the Government sent its reply to the allegations concerning the situation of SERJUSMIG. The Government states that: (i) AMAGIS claims that it initiated legal proceedings in  on the grounds that the judiciary was the subject of a defamation campaign by SERJUSMIG and that it was for the judicial authority to determine the existence or not of excesses; (ii) the legal proceedings resulted in a preliminary decision by the judge of the th Civil Chamber of Belo Horizonte; and (iii) in respect of that decision, SERJUSMIG filed an application with the Federal Supreme Court requesting that the examination of the case be transferred directly to the Federal Supreme Court, a request that was not accepted by the High Court. The Government is submitting the texts of the preliminary decision of  August  by the judge of the th Civil Chamber of Belo Horizonte and the October  decision by the Federal Supreme Court.
.The Committee notes that the present case refers, in the context of campaigns over wages, to allegations that the freedom of association and collective bargaining of trade union organizations of judicial employees is being hampered by the Judicial Authority of Minas Gerais and by the Judicial Authority of Maranho State.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the Judicial Authority of Minas Gerais State, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that: (i) in order to ensure the application of the wage adjustment to account for inflation that is provided for in the Federal Constitution and which, for , was granted by the Judicial Authority of Minas Gerais only to the magistrates and not to other court employees, SERJUSMIG initiated a campaign of protest; (ii) the campaign included posting on a social network the cover of a widely circulated national magazine that reported the high wages received by the TJMG president and the dissemination of a poster that compared the Minas Gerais magistrates with sharks; (iii) this campaign led to various legal actions for defamation being filed against SERJUSMIG by AMAGIS and by the TJMG president, and administrative disciplinary proceedings against several employees that participated in it; (iv) in a preliminary decision of  August , a Minas Gerais judge ordered SERJUSMIG to withdraw all communications that were the subject of legal action and to refrain from publishing any communications containing pejorative references to the magistrates of Minas Gerais; and (v) through decisions of August and November , the Judicial Council of the TJMG decided in an irregular manner to initiate disciplinary proceedings against nine employees who participated in the campaign.
.In relation to the aforementioned preliminary decision by the Belo Horizonte judge, the Committee notes that the complainants allege first of all that the Judicial Authority of Minas Gerais State is acting both as judge and as party, as it is the employer of the judiciary employees who are members of SERJUSMIG, and that the magistrates of the state courts have a direct interest in the defamation proceedings initiated by AMAGIS and the TJMG president; Brazil does not have a mechanism that would allow the court s jurisdiction to be transferred to the Federal Supreme Court in such cases. The Committee also notes in this regard the communication from the Government that contains the October  decision by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil, following the application filed by SERJUSMIG seeking to ensure that the defamation proceedings initiated against it by AMAGIS would not be examined by the courts of Minas Gerais State, but directly by the Federal Supreme Court itself. The Committee observes that, upon finding that the magistrates of the Court of Justice of Minas Gerais had not formally recused themselves, the Federal Supreme Court considered that, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, the jurisdiction of the Federal Supreme Court was not established in this case.
.The Committee takes due note of this decision of the Federal Supreme Court. The Committee emphasizes the importance that it has always attached to the fact that disputes and conflicts in trade union matters should be resolved by bodies that are independent of the parties and that, in this regard, judicial bodies usually constitute the greatest guarantee and expression of such independence. The Committee also recalls that it has drawn attention to the importance that should be attached to the principle that not only must justice be done, it must also be seen to be done [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. Observing that, according to the information received, the defamation proceedings against SERJUSMIG have so far given rise only to a preliminary decision, the Committee requests the Government first of all to report on the different options in terms of remedies available to the trade union organization with respect to the substance of the decisions handed down.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association notes that the complainants further state that the substance of the preliminary decision of  August  by the Belo Horizonte judge is contrary to the ILO Conventions and principles on freedom of association, in that: (i) the union s publications remained within the limits of freedom of expression; (ii) the union simply reproduced the cover of a widely circulated national magazine, which itself disseminated information that was not false (the president of the TJMG acknowledged the payment, specifying however that it was an occasional and not a monthly payment); and (iii) the right to criticize is inherent to freedom of association and therefore the censorship imposed by the judicial decision constitutes",-1,2017,Brazil
9,"interference in the legitimate trade union activities of SERJUSMIG.
.The Committee also takes note of the Government s reply that contains the text of the preliminary decision of  August  by the judge of the th Civil Chamber of Belo Horizonte. The Committee observes that, in that decision: (i) after recognizing the important role of trade unions of public servants, the judge considered that there was a certain degree of excess in the way in which SERJUSMIG had presented its claims and that an occasional payment received by the TJMG president had been presented by the union as his normal wage; and (ii) considering that the dissemination of the images and the information in question could create irreparable damage, the judge ordered SERJUSMIG to withdraw all communications that were the subject of legal action and to refrain from publishing any communications containing pejorative references to the magistrates of Minas Gerais.
.With regard to the freedom of expression of trade union organizations and its scope, the Committee recalls that its resolution of  concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties places special emphasis on freedom of opinion and expression, which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee also recalls that it has considered that the full exercise of trade union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas, and to this end workers, employers and their organizations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications and in the course of other trade union activities. Nevertheless, in expressing their opinions, these organizations should respect the limits of propriety and refrain from the use of insulting language [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ].
.Noting that, according to the information received, the defamation proceedings filed in  against SERJUSMIG have so far given rise only to a preliminary decision, the Committee trusts that the legal proceedings under way will be completed as soon as possible and that the aforementioned decisions by the Committee will be duly taken into consideration. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.Noting that it has not yet received the Government s reply on the administrative disciplinary proceedings that were allegedly brought against nine judiciary employees who participated in SERJUSMIG s campaign over wages, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations in this regard as soon as possible.
.With regard to the part of the complaint relating to the Judicial Authority of Maranho, the Committee notes that, in a communication of  June , the complainant organizations allege that: (i) with a view to ensuring the application of the wage adjustment to account for inflation that is provided for in the Federal Constitution, and after having exhausted all possibilities for dialogue, SINDJUS-MA carried out a strike from October to December ; (ii) despite the fact that the union had complied with all the requirements and even though the Court of Justice of Maranho State was the employer of the striking workers, that court declared the strike illegal and imposed a fine of BRL. million, an amount which threatens the survival of the union; (iii) without taking into consideration the solution proposed in May  in relation to the dispute that is the subject of this complaint by the National Council of Justice, the supervisory body of the Brazilian judicial system, the Court of Justice refused to allow the work that was suspended during the strike to be fulfilled through additional compensatory hours of work and it docked all pay corresponding to the duration of the strike; and (iv) the Court of Justice of Maranho State engages in anti-union acts and practices by refusing to receive union representatives and refusing to enter into negotiations with the union, in an attempt to discredit SINDJUS-MA as a representative of judiciary employees.
.Noting that the Government has not provided its observations on the allegations concerning the dispute between SINDJUS-MA and the Judicial Authority of Maranho State, the Committee requests the Government to send its reply in this regard as soon as possible.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the alleged lack of independence of the courts of Minas Gerais State that are examining the defamation cases against the Union of Judiciary Employees of Minas Gerais State (SERJUSMIG), the Committee requests the Government to report on the different options in terms of remedies available to that trade union organization with respect to the substance of the decisions handed down.(b)	Noting that, according to the information received, the defamation proceedings filed in  against SERJUSMIG have so far given rise only to a preliminary decision, the Committee trusts that the judicial proceedings under way will be completed as soon as possible and that the decisions by the Committee mentioned in the conclusions of this case will be duly taken into consideration.

.In its communication of March , the complainant organization alleges that three officials of its affiliated organization, the Union of Prison Security Officers of the State of Minas Gerais (SINDASP MG), Mr Adeilton de Souza Rocha (Union President), Mr Carlos Alberto Nogueira (Executive Director of the Union) and Ms Anita Fernandes Tocafundo (Executive Director of the Union), are the subject of disciplinary proceedings for having made use of trade union leave. In this regard, the complainant organization specifically alleges that: (i) administrative proceeding No. / was initiated after State Deputy Mr Cabo Jlio filed a complaint with the human resources department of the State Secretariat for Social Defence (SEDS), alleging irregularities in the conduct of trade union activities; (ii) this fact demonstrates the political nature of the aforementioned administrative proceedings; (iii) the three union officials who are the subject of the disciplinary proceedings have been in charge of the representation of prison security officers for many years, with Ms Anita Fernandes Tocafundo having been on full-time union leave since  and Mr Adeilton de Souza Rocha and Mr Carlos Alberto Nogueira since ; (iv) these full time union leave arrangements were obviously set up after the relevant authorizations had been granted by the hierarchical superiors and SEDS; (v) the documents proving that the full-time union leave had been expressly authorized were duly presented during the administrative proceedings, as were the corroborating testimonies of two former Secretaries of State for Social Defence, Mr Lafayete Andrada and Mr Romulo de Carvalho Ferraz, and two former Deputy Secretaries of State for Social Defence, Mr Genilson Ribeiro Zeferino and Mr Murilo Andrade de Oliveira; (vi) the directors of the units to which the three union officials had been assigned to work and several directors of the prison administration also confirmed that they were aware that the three union officials had been authorized to take full-time union leave; and (vii) furthermore, over the years in which they were in charge of the union representation of prison officers, the three union officials were, in the exercise of their union functions, permanently in touch with the executive branch of the State of Minas Gerais and also with the human resources department of SEDS, and they never received any comments about possible irregularities in their representation work.
.The complainant organization further states that, despite all of the above, the committee in charge of the administrative proceedings produced a report stating that the authorities mentioned were not competent to grant authorization for full-time union leave. The complainant organization also states that, in addition to all the substantive arguments set out above, SINDASP MG presented a series of procedural means of defence that demonstrated the invalidity of the administrative proceedings, but that these were not taken into consideration. These arguments included, in particular: (i) the absence in the complaint of any evidence of damage to the public finances; and (ii) the absence of any liability on the part of the trade union organization in the event that the authorizations granted by the administrative authorities were characterized by irregularities.
.The complainant organization states that, despite all of the above and despite the impeccable behaviour of the three union officials who always worked for the common good, the director of SEDS decided to impose a -day suspension as a sanction. The complainant organization states that it filed an appeal against that decision, which is currently under examination. More generally, the complainant organization asks institutions to avoid practices that are aimed at penalizing the regular exercise of trade union activity in the State of Minas Gerais.
.In a communication of  March , the Government states that, according to the annexes to the complaint, several public servants of the State of Minas Gerais were the subject of administrative disciplinary proceedings for failing to comply with certain formal requirements regarding trade union representation, and that, as a result of these proceedings, two public servants received a sanction of suspension. The Government states that, by virtue of the federal autonomy enshrined in the Constitution of Brazil, the Ministry of Labour of the Union has no competence to interfere in the administrative proceedings under way in the different states of the Federation.
.The Government adds that: (i) according to the available documentation, the disciplinary proceedings are still before the administrative authorities; (ii) the public servants had the opportunity to exercise their right of defence in accordance with constitutional principles; (iii) according to the documents, the parties have so far not initiated judicial proceedings; (iv) the judicial branch of Brazil takes due account of ILO instruments when examining allegations of anti-union acts in order to provide adequate protection, as stated in Convention No.  ratified by Brazil; and (v) in the event that the parties consider themselves aggrieved by the final decision of the administrative proceedings currently under way, they will have the opportunity to take legal action.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government transmits information provided by the State Secretariat for Social Defence in the State of Minas Gerais, which states that: (i) in the framework of the administrative disciplinary process No. / concerning public servants Adeilton de Souza Rocha, Carlos Alberto Nogueira and Anita Fernandes Tocafundo, the commission examining the case suggested the imposition of a sanction of suspension of  days for not having observed the legal formalities regarding trade union representation; (ii) this decision was based on the breach of article  of the Constitution of the State of Minas Gerais which establishes the number of full-time union leave that can be issued based on the number of trade union members; (iii) it was found that the trade union to which the three public servants were affiliated already benefited from the maximum number of trade union leave corresponding to the number of its members, which is why the granting of additional leave would have required the authorization of the Secretary of State Planning and Management (SEPLAG); and (iv) having found that such authorization had not been granted but that the issuance of full-time union leave to the three mentioned persons originated in a decision of the State Secretary for Social Defence at the time of the facts, it was concluded that the granting of full-time trade union leave to Adeilton de Souza Rocha, Carlos Alberto Nogueira and Anita Fernandes Tocafundo was not lawful.
.The State Secretariat for Social Defence in the State of Minas Gerais further informs that public servants Adeilton de Souza Rocha and Carlos Alberto Nogueira are currently exercising their mandate in the leadership of the trade union and that Anita Fernandes Tocafundo is no longer working after having requested an early retirement.
.The Committee notes that the present case concerns the situation of three union officials from the prison administration of the State of Minas Gerais who are the subject of disciplinary proceedings for alleged irregularities in the obtaining of full-time trade union leave. In this respect, the Committee takes note of the complainant organization s allegation that the disciplinary proceedings against the President and the two Executive Directors of SINDASP MG, Mr Adeilton de Souza Rocha, Ms Anita Fernandes Tocafundo and Mr Carlos Alberto Nogueira, are politically motivated as they were initiated following a complaint filed by a state deputy for Minas Gerais and that the -day suspension that was imposed on them is unjustified insofar as: (i) the three union officials that have occupied their positions for many years provided evidence of the authorizations concerning their full time union leave, and the corresponding testimonies of those who granted them; (ii) over the years in which they represented on a full-time basis prison officers in the State of Minas Gerais, the three union officials were permanently in touch with the executive branch of the State of Minas Gerais and with the human resources department of the penitentiary institution and they never received any comments about possible irregularities in their representation work; (iii) trade union officials should not be held liable for any mistakes made by the administration itself in the process of authorizing trade union leave; and (iv) for the reasons given above, the disciplinary sanctions were the subject of an administrative appeal that is still pending.
.The Committee also notes that the Government states that by virtue of the federal autonomy enshrined in the Constitution of Brazil, the Ministry of Labour of the Union has no competence to interfere in administrative proceedings under way in the different states of the Federation, that the right to defence was respected throughout the process and that trade union leaders subjected to sanctions",-1,2017,Brazil
11,"can take legal action available to them, if they so desire.
.The Committee further notes that the Government submits observations of the State Secretariat for Social Defence in the State of Minas Gerais, which state that: (i) the sanction of suspension of  days against the three union leaders proposed by the commission responsible for the examination of the administrative disciplinary process was based on the finding that the corresponding trade union had already obtained the maximum amount of union leave recognized by the Constitution of the State; (ii) the granting of additional leave would have required an authorization of the SEPLAG, while the three public servants only obtained the authorization of the State Secretary for Social Defence at the time; (iii) therefore, the granting of paid union leave to the three union leaders was not lawful; and (iv) public servants Mr Adeilton de Souza Rocha and Mr Carlos Alberto Nogueira are currently exercising their leadership mandate in the trade union and Ms Anita Fernandes Tocafundo is not working as she had requested an early retirement.
.While noting that the Government s reply does not specify who was responsible for obtaining the authorization from the institution competent for granting additional union leave, the Committee observes from the information provided that the trade union to which the three union leaders were affiliated already benefited from the maximum amount of paid union leave provided for in the legal system of the State of Minas Gerais and that although the entity employing the mentioned public servants granted them full-time leave, an authorization was not obtained from the institution competent to attribute additional union leave. In these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2017,Brazil

The SECEFERGS sent further communications on  April and  June . The UGT and SECEFERGS jointly sent another communication on  June .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  March .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their initial communications, the complainant organizations allege that, under the management of its new president, Mr Romildo Bolzam Jnior, Grmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense (hereinafter the football club) has engaged in anti-union practices since , including the dismissal of several union officials and the violation of the provisions of a collective agreement. The complainant organizations specifically allege that: (i) four union officials were dismissed without cause, namely: Mr Arci Da Silva Caetano, member of the union s supervisory board and deputy director of FETECFERGS; Ms Tania Marilda de Freitas, deputy member of the federation s supervisory board; Mr Virlei Reis Gonalves, deputy member of the supervisory board of SECEFERGS and deputy director of FETECFERGS; and Mr Silvio Vargas de Oliveira, member of the supervisory board of SECEFERGS and deputy director of FETECFERGS; (ii) SECEFERGS and FETECFERGS lodged appeals against the above-mentioned dismissals, with a preliminary decision ordering reinstatement being obtained in the case of Ms de Freitas, and the corresponding decisions still pending in respect of the other cases; (iii) on  June , Mr Andrade Osrio Brittes Pacheco Prates, an employee of the football club and deputy director of SECEFERGS who was under a significant amount of stress, died; and (iv) since May , the wages of the football club s employees have not been reviewed, in violation of the collective standards applicable in the enterprise.
.In a communication of  April , SECEFERGS provides the following additional information: (i) the Regional Labour Court of the Fourth Region ordered the reinstatement of Mr Arci Da Silva Caetano; (ii) the preliminary decision to reinstate Ms Tania Marilda de Freitas was upheld by the Regional Labour Court of the Fourth Region; (iii) Mr Virlei Reis Gonalves first obtained a preliminary decision ordering his reinstatement, which was then upheld by the Regional Labour Court of the Fourth Region; (iv) the president of the football club initiated legal proceedings against SECEFERGS and its president, Mr Miguel Salaberry Filho; and (v) in turn, SECEFERGS initiated legal proceedings against the football club for violating the collective standards applicable in the enterprise. In a communication of  June , SECEFERGS alleges that the above-mentioned violations are still ongoing, including the dismissal on  May  of a fifth union official, Mr Mauro Roberto Rosito.
.In a communication of  June , the UGT and SECEFERGS indicate that, in two decisions handed down by the Regional Labour Court of the Fourth Region, the football club was ordered to reinstate Mr Mauro Roberto Rosito and to comply with several provisions of the collective agreement of '  applicable to the sector.
.In a communication of  March , the Government sent its reply to the complainants' allegations. The Government states that the initial decisions of the Regional Labour Court of the Fourth Region, partially granting the petitions filed by the workers, demonstrate that a legal framework and protection mechanisms are in place to safeguard workers against any potentially anti-union acts. The Government considers that, in the light of the foregoing, there is no indication in the present case of any shortcomings by the Government of Brazil in respect of the protection of workers against anti-union acts, and it therefore requests that the case be closed.
.The Committee notes that the present case refers to allegations of anti-union practices on the part of a football club, including the unfair dismissal of five union officials in  and , and the violation, since , of several provisions of the collective instruments applicable to the football club in question, especially with regard to wage reviews. The Committee also notes that the complainant organizations mention that a union official who was allegedly under a significant amount of stress died in  as a result of a heart attack.
.The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that the decisions of the Regional Labour Court of the Fourth Region, partially granting the petitions filed by the workers of the football club, show that a legal framework and protection mechanisms are in place to safeguard workers against any potentially anti-union acts, demonstrating, in the present case, the absence of any shortcomings in respect of the protection of freedom of association by the Government of Brazil.
.The Committee observes that both the complainant organizations and the Government refer to several decisions of the Regional Labour Court of the Fourth Region relating to the allegations made within the framework of the present case. In particular, the Committee notes that, according to the information and the accompanying documents provided by the complainant organizations: (i) the dismissal on  May  of four union officials (Mr Da Silva Caetano, Ms de Freitas, Mr Reis Gonalves and Mr Vargas de Oliveira) resulted in court decisions being handed down between June and October  ordering their reinstatement on the grounds that special protection is afforded by law to persons who have a trade union mandate; (ii) the dismissal on  May  of a fifth union official, Mr Mauro Roberto Rosito, resulted in a court decision ordering his reinstatement, in the absence of serious misconduct; and (iii) the allegations of non-compliance with the provisions of the collective instruments applicable to the football club in respect of wage reviews resulted in two court decisions of March and June , partially granting the petitions filed by the union. The Committee further observes that the complainant organizations have neither challenged the above-mentioned court decisions nor referred to any failure to comply with the reinstatement orders.
.The Committee notes that it is apparent from the foregoing that the two main allegations of the complainant organizations have resulted in swift court decisions, which have led, first, to the reinstatement of the five dismissed union officials and, second, to the football club being required to apply several provisions of the collective instruments in force. Trusting that the above-mentioned court decisions will contribute to ensuring full compliance in the future with the principles of freedom of association in the football club, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2016,Brazil
13,".The Committee examined this case at its May June  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (June ), paras ' ].
.The complainant organizations presented additional information in communications received on  May and  September .
.The Government sent observations in communications of  May and  October ,  September  and  February .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following interim recommendation concerning the allegations presented by the complainant organizations [see th Report, para. ]:Recalling that it is important for workers to be able to freely choose which organization will represent them, the Committee requests the Government to send promptly its observations on the complainant s allegation that it was deprived of the right to represent fast-food workers in the state of So Paulo, including information on the procedures and decisions that led to such situation. The Committee also requests the complainant to provide more detailed information on the extent of its representativeness in the state of So Paulo in general and in the state s fast-food restaurants in particular as well as updated information on the court proceeding that SINDIFAST would have initiated against SINTHORESP.
.In two communications received on  May and  September , SINTHORESP provides additional information on the various aspects of this case. The complainant organization first of all clarifies that: (i) the dispute between SINTHORESP and SINDIFAST over representation does not concern fast-food restaurants in the state of So Paulo, but rather those in the municipality of So Paulo, an area with a very high number of such restaurants; and (ii) the trade union contributions taken away from SINTHORESP to be paid to SINDIFAST are not, as the Government incorrectly claimed, compulsory contributions that are contrary to ILO principles and that were in fact abolished by the  legislative reform, but rather contributions that have been negotiated under collective agreements and are applicable to workers who are not members of the union but who derive benefits from the collective agreement (the so-called  solidarity contributions' .
.SINTHORESP then refers to the dispute that it has before the courts with SINDIFAST and claims in this respect that: (i) the payments of union contributions by a number of fast-food restaurants in the municipality of So Paulo to SINDIFAST instead of to SINTHORESP are fraudulent and are being made without the consent of the workers concerned, which is a key dimension of freedom of association that is not being taken into account by the judicial bodies; (ii) SINTHORESP represents fast-food workers in  other municipalities; (iii) the establishment of SINDIFAST has given rise to external interference by enterprises, which is contrary to Convention No. , which has been ratified by Brazil; and (iv) the collective agreement signed by SINDIFAST has led to a deterioration of working conditions and has resulted in a  per cent reduction in the wages of the workers concerned, which demonstrates the non-representative character of this trade union organization.
.Lastly, the complainant organization also refers to the fact that SINDIFAST instituted a number of judicial proceedings to deprive SINTHORESP of the right to represent several fast-food restaurants, requesting that the corresponding trade union dues be returned to it and calling for SINTHORESP to be fined millions of Brazilian reais. The complainant organization states that, in this context, the labour court is ordering SINTHORESP to pay out  million Brazilian reais (BRL), thereby threatening the very existence of the trade union organization.
.By communications of  May and  October , the Government provides replies to the recommendation made by the Committee during its first examination of the case and the additional information sent by SINTHORESP. The Government refers first to the allegations by the complainant organization that it was deprived of the right to represent fast-food workers in the municipality of So Paulo, including information on the procedures and decisions that led to the said exclusion. The Government states in this regard that: (i) under article  of the  Constitution, the Ministry of Labour cannot intervene in the organization and functioning of trade unions and it is prohibited to make the establishment of trade unions subject to prior authorization; (ii) at the same time, by virtue of smula [summary of case law] No.  of the Federal Supreme Court, the Ministry of Labour is responsible for registering trade union organizations and ensuring that the single trade union principle is respected; (iii) however, it is not the Ministry s responsibility to assess the representativeness of trade unions beyond what is implicitly required by law; (iv) Brazilian legislation does not contain specific criteria for determining the representativeness of trade unions; (v) article (II) of the Constitution establishes however the single trade union system, under which it is prohibited to establish more than one trade union organization, at any level, to represent the same professional or economic category, in the same territorial area; (vi) within the framework of the single trade union system, article  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws enshrines the principle of specificity, which allows for the establishment of a new trade union organization that has a more specific scope of activity than an existing union, which can lead to a situation in which two trade unions can request the right to represent the same category of workers; and (vii) the majority of case law and legal doctrine consider that the principle of specificity should prevail over the principle of territoriality.
.After having described the general rules and criteria applicable to the determination of trade union representativeness, the Government refers to the decision of the Supreme Labour Court granting SINDIFAST the right to represent fast-food workers in the municipality of So Paulo. The Government states in this respect that the Supreme Labour Court s decision of  August  was based on the above-mentioned principle of specificity and that the court considered that SINDIFAST had greater legitimacy to represent this category of workers because it was devoted exclusively to fast-food restaurants.
.The Government then refers to the allegations by the complainant organizations concerning the excessive fines imposed on SINTHORESP by the courts. The Government states in this respect that: (i) the Government fully respects the independence of the judiciary; (ii) the courts fined SINTHORESP because they found that the organization had made use of the judicial system in bad faith by initiating multiple identical judicial proceedings despite knowing in advance the outcome of these proceedings; and (iii) this is notwithstanding the fact that in some of the cases brought by SINTHORESP it is the enterprise that is the subject of the proceedings that has had to bear the legal costs.
.The Committee recalls that the present case concerns the situation of a trade union in the catering sector, SINTHORESP, which, under the legal mechanism of enquadramento sindical [trade union coverage], has lost the right to represent fast-food workers in the municipality of So Paulo in favour of SINDIFAST, a decision that is considered by the complainant organizations to be unfair on the grounds that SINDIFAST is not representative.
.The Committee takes note of the additional information provided by the complainant organizations according to which: (i) the workers concerned did not give their consent before their union dues were diverted to SINDIFAST; (ii) SINTHORESP represents fast-food workers in  other municipalities; (iii) the establishment of SINDIFAST has led to external interference by enterprises, which is contrary to Convention No.  that has been ratified by Brazil; and (iv) the collective agreement signed by SINDIFAST has led to a significant deterioration in the working conditions and pay of the workers concerned, which demonstrates the non-representative character of this trade union organization. The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government states that: (i) while it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour to register trade union organizations and ensure respect for the single trade union principle (under which it is prohibited to establish more than one trade union organization, at any level, to represent the same professional or economic category, in the same territorial area), it is not its responsibility to carry out an assessment of the representativeness of trade unions beyond what is implicitly required by law; (ii) Brazilian legislation does not contain specific criteria for determining the representativeness of trade unions; (iii) within the framework of the single trade union system established by the Constitution, article  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws enshrines the principle of specificity according to which a new trade union organization that has a more specific scope of activity than an existing union may be established; and (iv) the Supreme Labour Court relied on the above-mentioned principle of specificity and granted SINDIFAST the right to represent fast-food workers considering that this organization",-1,2016,Brazil
14,"enjoyed greater legitimacy owing to the fact that it was devoted exclusively to this type of restaurant.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee recalls that the dispute over representation between SINTHORESP and SINDIFAST has arisen in the context of the Brazilian system of collective labour relations, which is governed by the single trade union principle, according to which only one trade union organization may legitimately represent, on a territorial basis that may not be smaller than a municipality, a given category of workers. The Committee also notes that the single trade union system, which has been the subject of recommendations by the Committee in previous cases because of the restrictions it imposes on the right of workers to form and join the trade union of their choice [see, for example, th Report, Case No. , para. ], does not prevent disputes over representation from arising when two trade union organizations claim to be the best qualified to represent a given category of workers. The Committee also notes that this type of dispute may arise in particular when, as in the present case, a new trade union is established with a more limited scope of activity than an existing trade union.
.The Committee notes that, in the context of the dispute over representation between SINTHORESP and SINDIFAST, neither the complainant organizations nor the Government provide specific data that would make it possible to assess the representativeness of each of the two organizations and, in particular, they do not provide figures on how many members they have in the fast-food sector in the municipality of So Paulo. The Committee also notes that, in the same vein, the Supreme Labour Court decision cited by the Government granting representative status to SINDIFAST is based on the principle of specificity following the exclusive dedication of that organization to fast-food restaurants.
.The Committee recalls in this respect that workers and employers should in practice be able to freely choose which organization will represent them for purposes of collective bargaining [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that: (i) in order to encourage the harmonious development of collective bargaining and to avoid disputes, it should always be the practice to follow, where they exist, the procedures laid down for the designation of the most representative unions for collective bargaining purposes when it is not clear by which unions the workers wish to be represented. In the absence of such procedures, the authorities, where appropriate, should examine the possibility of laying down objective rules in this respect; (ii) in order to determine whether an organization has the capacity to be the sole signatory to collective agreements, two criteria should be applied: representativeness and independence; according to the Committee, the determination of which organizations meet these criteria should be carried out by a body offering every guarantee of independence and objectivity; and (iii) where, under the system in force, the most representative union enjoys preferential or exclusive bargaining rights, decisions concerning the most representative organization should be made by virtue of objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunities for partiality or abuse [see Compilation, paras ,  and ]. In the light of these criteria, the Committee expects that the disputes over representation, including the present case, will be settled by applying objective and pre-established criteria for representativeness determined by the Government in consultation with the social partners, taking due account of the wishes of the workers concerned.
.The Committee, further notes the Government s indication that national legislation does not contain criteria for determining representativeness that would make it possible to settle the representation disputes that may arise between several trade union organizations, and observes that this absence may hinder the right of workers to be represented in collective bargaining by the trade union of their choice. As Brazil has ratified Conventions Nos  and , the Committee refers this legislative aspect to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.. In relation to the Committee s request for the complainant organizations to provide updated information on the court proceedings that SINDIFAST is said to have initiated against SINTHORESP, the Committee notes that the complainant organizations allege that; (i) in the context of the legal proceedings initiated by SINDIFAST to deprive SINTHORESP of the right to represent several other fast food restaurants, SINDIFAST requested that the corresponding trade union dues be returned to it and called for SINTHORESP to be fined millions of Brazilian reais; and (ii) in this context, the labour courts are asking SINTHORESP to pay out BRL million, thereby threatening the very existence of the trade union organization. The Committee notes that, for its part, the Government does not refer to the proceedings between SINDIFAST and SINTHORESP, merely recalling that the fine imposed on SINTHORESP by the courts at the time was based on that trade union organization s use of the legal system in bad faith. While noting that it does not have the information that would enable it to comment specifically on the ongoing proceedings between the two organizations, the Committee trusts that the application of clear and pre-established criteria for representativeness, as referred to in the preceding paragraphs, will make it possible to settle the above-mentioned dispute in accordance with the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Taking into account that national legislation does not contain criteria for determining representativeness that would make it possible to settle the representation disputes that may arise between several trade union organizations, the Committee expects that the disputes over representation, including the present case, will be settled on the basis of objective and pre established criteria for representativeness determined by the Government in consultation with the social partners, taking due account of the wishes of the workers concerned.(b) The Committee refers the legislative aspects of the case to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.(c) The Committee considers that this case is closed and does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a joint communication dated  December  from the Union of Hotel, Bar, Cafeteria and Allied Workers of So Paulo and the Surrounding Region (SINTHORESP), the National Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality Workers (CONTRATUH) and the New Workers' Federation (NCST) and additional communications of  September and  December  and  March  from SINTHORESP.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of December , the complainants allege that a court judgment imposing a high fine on SINTHORESP for bringing legal proceedings is hindering the trade union s access to justice and constitutes a violation of freedom of association. The complainants allege, specifically, that: (i) on  September , the th Labour Court of So Paulo fined SINTHORESP , Brazilian reais (BRL) (approximately US$,) for bringing separate court proceedings requesting that several restaurants in the McDonald s franchise (hereinafter the  fast-food chain'  pay it the trade union dues that it was owed; (ii) the amount of the fine is exorbitant when compared with the sum that the union requested in the proceedings (BRL,); (iii) the purpose of the fine was to place the union s activities under the State s control through arbitrary action that violates Article () of Convention No. , which prohibits the public authorities from interfering in trade union activities; (iv) the union was entitled to request, through separate judicial proceedings, that each of the fast-food chain s restaurants pay the trade union contribution since each of them is registered as a separate entity; (v) while SINTHORESP is alleged to have committed judicial harassment and was fined for doing so, the proceedings that it brought are, in reality, an example of its trade union activism aimed at defending workers in the restaurant industry as a whole and those of the fast-food chain in particular, including by attempting to eliminate zero-hours contracts in that chain; and (vi) the fine imposed on SINTHORESP therefore constitutes a clear violation of the obligation of the public authorities in general, and the judiciary in particular, to protect freedom of association.
.In its other communications, the complainant states that the fine imposed by the judiciary is part of a broader pattern of hostility towards SINTHORESP on the part of the enterprise and the State and, in that connection, that: (i) court decisions have deprived it of the right to represent fast-food restaurant workers in the state of So Paulo; only the Union of Fast-Food Workers of the City of So Paulo (SINDIFAST) may do so; (ii) this is only true in the state of So",-1,2016,Brazil
15,"Paulo; SINTHORESP is still recognized as the union that represents restaurant workers ' including fast-food workers ' in the rest of the country; (iii) the denial of SINTHORESP s right to represent fast-food workers in the state of So Paulo is an example of the protection that the public authorities grant to the aforementioned fast-food chain owing to the magnitude of the economic interests at stake since  per cent of the chain s Brazilian restaurants are located in that state; (iv) the fast-food workers who were the stakeholders most directly concerned were not consulted as to which trade union should represent them; and (v) the Government has made no attempt to facilitate consultations between the various trade unions with a view to a fair resolution of this dispute concerning representation.
.The complainants add that: (i) as a consequence of the establishment of the  yellow' union, SINDIFAST, and the subsequent replacement of SINTHORESP as the union entitled to represent fast-food workers in the state of So Paulo, SINDIFAST brought court proceedings in two venues ' the labour court and the ordinary court ' requesting retroactive payment by SINTHORESP of the fast-food restaurants' union dues; (ii) pending the issuance of the relevant court judgments, SINTHORESP s bank accounts have been frozen, preventing it from paying the wages of its  employees and providing services to its members and the workers that it represents; (iii) SINDIFAST is calling for the payment of millions of Brazilian reais and a court decision in its favour would threaten the very existence of SINTHORESP, preventing it from defending the over , restaurant workers who use its services on a daily basis; and (iv) all of the foregoing is proof that the Government and the employers are attempting to weaken one of the world s largest trade unions for the industry through trade union fragmentation.
.In a communication of  May , the Government forwards the information provided by Brazil s Supreme Labour Court. With respect to the aspect of the complaint that concerns the fine imposed on SINTHORESP for judicial harassment, the Court states that: (i) the alleged events do not constitute a violation of any national or international standard on freedom of association; (ii) SINTHORESP brought countless legal proceedings requesting that retail establishments be required to pay the compulsory trade union dues to it rather than to other trade unions; (iii) in all of these cases, the court found that the enterprises in question did not fall within the scope of SINTHORESP s activities and that the compulsory dues were being paid to the appropriate trade unions; (iv) pursuant to Brazilian law, because SINTHORESP continued to bring new legal proceedings even though the courts had already ruled on the cases in question, the courts cautioned that the complainant was using the judicial system in bad faith; (v) the fine of BRL, (approximately US$,) that the courts imposed on SINTHORESP reflects both the seriousness of the union s conduct and the economic value of the subject of the proceedings brought before the court (over BRL million; (vi) the size of the fine does not threaten the union s existence or reduce its ability to act since its economic resources are sufficient to comply with the court judgment; (vii) under Brazil s legal system, the complainant had available to it more than ten avenues for challenging the judgment in the courts; (viii) the complainant was given every opportunity to mount a defence and the judgment issued respected all the rules of due process and was in no way flawed; (ix) the courts did not interfere with SINTHORESP s activities since, by bringing judicial proceedings, the union itself requested them to intervene; and (x) the fact that the complainant was fined for flagrant misuse of judicial remedies is proof that the laws are applicable to all subjects of law.
.The Committee observes that the present case concerns the situation in the fast food industry of a trade union in the restaurant sector, SINTHORESP, which, under the legal mechanism of enquadramento sindical (trade union coverage), has lost the right to represent fast-food workers in the state of So Paulo. In that connection, the Committee observes that according to the trade union: (i) the public authorities' refusal to allow it to represent the aforementioned workers is unwarranted; and (ii) the fine that the courts imposed on the union for  judicial harassment' after it had brought numerous proceedings requesting that fast-food restaurants in the state of So Paulo continue to pay trade union contributions to it constitutes a violation of the union s freedom of association.
.With regard to the allegation that the complainant has been unfairly denied the right to represent fast-food workers in the state of So Paulo, the Committee takes note of the complainant s allegation that: (i) through court decisions, it was replaced by SINDIFAST, a trade union viewed as sympathetic to the employers' interests; (ii) such a replacement took place only in the state of So Paulo and is an example of the protection that the public authorities grant to one fast-food chain in particular owing to the magnitude of the economic interests at stake since  per cent of the chain s Brazilian restaurants are located in that state; (iii) the fast-food workers were not consulted as to which trade union should represent them; (iv) the Government has made no attempt to facilitate consultations between the various trade unions with a view to a fair resolution of this dispute concerning representation; (v) on the contrary, SINDIFAST has brought legal proceedings requesting retroactive payment by SINTHORESP of millions of reais in fast-food restaurants' union dues; and (vi) all of the foregoing is proof that the Government and the employers are attempting to weaken one of the world s largest trade unions for the industry through fragmentation.
.The Committee notes with regret that to date, the Government has not sent its observations on this aspect of the complaint related to the legal mechanism of enquadramento sindical, whereby a single union is empowered to represent the workers in a given industry and geographical area. On this point, the Committee recalls that it has long since expressed its views on Brazil s single trade union system, emphasizing that the imposition by law of the trade union monopoly in Brazil is not compatible with the principles of freedom of association and therefore urging the Government to ensure that national law was brought into conformity with such decisions [see, for example, Case No. , th Report, para. ]. The Committee has also recalled in general terms that workers and employers should be able to freely choose which organization will represent them for purposes of collective bargaining and that systems based on a sole bargaining agent (the most representative) and those which include all organizations or the most representative organizations in accordance with clear pre-established criteria for the determination of the organizations entitled to bargain are both compatible with Convention No.  [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras ' ]. Emphasizing the importance of the above for collective labour relations systems in general and Brazil s system in particular, the Committee requests the Government to send promptly its observations on the complainant s allegation that it was deprived of the right to represent fast-food workers in the state of So Paulo including information on the procedures and decisions that led to such situation. The Committee also requests the complainant to provide more detailed information on the extent of its representativeness in the state of So Paulo in general and in the state s fast-food restaurants in particular as well as updated information on the court proceeding that SINDIFAST would have initiated against SINTHORESP.
.With respect to the fine that the courts have reportedly imposed on SINTHORESP for judicial harassment, the Committee notes that according to the complainant: on  September , the th Labour Court of So Paulo fined SINTHORESP BRL, (approximately US$,) for bringing separate court proceedings requesting that several of a franchise s restaurants pay it the trade union dues that it was owed; (ii) the amount of the fine is exorbitant and was intended to place the union s activities under the State s control; (iii) the large number of judicial proceedings is a consequence of the fact that each of the chain s restaurants is registered as a separate entity; and (iv) the numerous proceedings that SINTHORESP has brought, which the judiciary views as judicial harassment, are in reality an example of its trade union activism, which is necessary in order to improve the working conditions of fast-food workers and defend them from the emergence of unions that are sympathetic to the employers. The Committee also notes that the Government forwards the reply from the President of the Federal Labour Court, who states that: (i) SINTHORESP brought countless legal proceedings requesting that retail establishments be required to pay the compulsory trade union dues to it rather than to other trade unions; (ii) in",-1,2016,Brazil
16,"all of these cases, the court found that the enterprises in question did not fall within the scope of SINTHORESP s activities and that the compulsory dues were being paid to the appropriate trade unions; (iii) because SINTHORESP continued to bring identical legal proceedings, the courts cautioned that the complainant ' which, like other subjects of law, must respect the laws ' was using the judicial system in bad faith; (iv) the fine of BRL, reflects the seriousness of the union s conduct and the size of the fine does not threaten its existence; and (v) due process and the right to a defence were respected and the union had available to it many avenues for challenging the judgment.
.The Committee recalls that freedom of association implies not only the right of workers and employers to form freely organizations of their own choosing, but also the right for the organizations themselves to pursue lawful activities for the defence of their occupational interests [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee emphasizes that, to that end, occupational organizations must have free access to the courts in order to defend their interests and those of their members without fear of adverse consequences that might serve as a deterrent to subsequent legal proceedings. While taking due note of the statement by the Supreme Labour Court that trade unions, like other subjects of law, must obey the laws, the Committee observes that in the present case, it does not have sufficient information to determine whether freedom of association has been restricted.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Recalling that it is important for workers to be able to freely choose which organization will represent them, the Committee requests the Government to send promptly its observations on the complainant s allegation that it was deprived of the right to represent fast-food workers in the state of So Paulo, including information on the procedures and decisions that led to such situation. The Committee also requests the complainant to provide more detailed information on the extent of its representativeness in the state of So Paulo in general and in the state s fast-food restaurants in particular as well as updated information on the court proceeding that SINDIFAST would have initiated against SINTHORESP.",-1,2016,Brazil
17,".With reference to Case No. , the Committee recalls that the National Federation of Federal Police Officers (FENAPEF) alleged that in carrying out trade union activities several of its officials suffered acts of anti-union discrimination by the police authorities. At its November  meeting, when examining the substance of the case, the Committee took due note that the Government, on a tripartite basis, proposed developing a draft bill to prevent, investigate and combat anti-union practices. With regard to the specific alleged acts of anti-union discrimination against the six union officials, the Committee regretted that the Government had merely stated that the administrative disciplinary proceedings could be appealed in the courts and that the principles of due process were respected. On this basis, the Committee formulated the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee expects that the draft bill on anti-union discrimination will shortly be submitted to the Executive and recalls that, if it so wishes, it can make use of ILO technical assistance in this process. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it about the outcome of the administrative disciplinary proceedings concerning five union officials and whether appeals have been lodged in this regard. The Committee also regrets the delay in the reinstatement proceedings initiated seven years ago by Mr Jos Pereira Orihuela, President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Roraima and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this case.
.With reference to Case No. , the Committee notes that, in a communication dated  May , the Union of Federal Police Officers of the State of Paraiba (SINPEF/PB), supported by FENAPEF, submitted a complaint relating to matters that had already been examined in the framework of Case No.  and that consequently the Committee decided to examine them together. In particular, the complainant organization provides further details about the disciplinary proceedings against the trade union official Mr Francisco Leodcio Neves, Deputy Director of Communications, for having published an article criticizing the police s investigation methods (according to the complainant organization, although the Police Disciplinary Committee concluded that the trade union official in question had not committed any offence and requested that the case be closed, the federal police authorities asked that the disciplinary proceedings be reopened). The Committee notes that, in its reply of  March , the Government states that it has not yet been possible to establish a definition in national legislation of anti-union conduct, but that a draft bill is currently under discussion in the Industrial Relations Council ' a tripartite body ' whose principal objective is to prohibit anti-union practices. The Government further indicates that the federal police has been asked to inform it of the final outcome of the reopening of the administrative disciplinary proceedings against the abovementioned trade union official.
.In these circumstances, the Committee refers to its previous recommendations and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments on all the pending issues.",-1,2011,Brazil

.In these circumstances, the Committee refers to its previous recommendations and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments on all the pending issues.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Federation of Federal Police Officials (FENAPEF) dated  March . The FENAPEF sent further information in communications dated  July and  August .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  June,  August and  October  and  June .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  March,  July and  August , the FENAPEF indicates that it groups together  state trade unions, and represents over , workers at all levels of the federal police. The FENAPEF alleges that the institution s management carry out acts of persecution aimed at restricting the exercise of trade union activity by the representatives of federal police employees.
.Specifically, the FENAPEF alleges that administrative disciplinary proceedings were initiated and a police investigation opened against the organization s Communications Director, Mr Josias Fernandes Alves, federal police officer. The complainant states that the official in question has been in post for almost  years and that he has never been subject to a disciplinary action.
.The FENAPEF alleges that at the end of , the first disciplinary action was instigated against the aforementioned trade union official because of an article published on the organization s website in which criticisms were made about the selection process of a National Police Academy competitive examination (the trade union official was penalized with two days' suspension, which was completed on  and  August ). The complainant adds that, for the same misdemeanour, the launch of a police investigation was ordered into the alleged commission of the  offence of insult and defamation' and legal proceedings instigated for moral damages by the trade union official (the complainant reports that both actions were declared inadmissible by the Special Civil Court No.  of Brasilia). The complainant states that, by order of the Federal Police Regional Superintendant in Minas Gerais, further disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the same trade union official at the beginning of February , for participating in a meeting of the trade union organization in Brasilia.
.The FENAPEF indicates that provisions of Act No. / of  on the legal regime governing federal district federal and civil police officers were invoked in the aforementioned disciplinary proceedings. According to the complainant, this legislation was used to satisfy personal whims of the administrators, clearly aiming to restrict the exercise of freedom of association, freedom of demonstration and freedom of thought. The complainant states that the Act was adopted during the last dictatorship and that a number of its provisions violate the Constitution.
.The FENAPEF adds that the President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of the State of Baha, Ms Rejane Peres Teixeria, was also subjected to acts of anti-union persecution and that in that context, the Regional Superintendence of the Federal Police of Baha initiated three administrative disciplinary proceedings against her because of a press interview in which she referred to defects in weapons acquired by the institution. She was charged with failing to obey a police assignment order and being absent from duty in order to participate in trade union events without the authorization of management. In that connection, the FENAPEF states that there is an obvious need for officials, in carrying out their trade union activities, to participate in meetings in various cities where unionized police officers work, but that Ms Peres Texeira always asked permission from her immediate superior and expressed her willingness to make up time for any absences from duty (the complainant states that these facts were reported to the Federal Public Ministry and that a habeas corpus petition was filed in the Federal Court of Baha).
.The FENAPEF also alleges the following acts of anti-union discrimination:' the initiation of administrative disciplinary proceedings by the Federal Police authorities in Brasilia against Mr Julio Gomes de Carvalho Junio, an officer of the Union of Federal Police Officers of the Federal District (SINDIPOL/DF) in , for publishing an article containing criticisms of the management of the institution s Operational Aviation Coordination;' the initiation of administrative disciplinary proceedings by the Regional Superintendence of the Federal Police Department of Paraiba against Mr Francisco Leodecio Neves, Deputy Director of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Paraiba in , for writing an article criticizing investigation methods in Brazil;' the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against Mr Paulo Pimenta, Vice-President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Acre in , for writing an article on the website of the FENAPEF (this official resigned after disciplinary proceedings were initiated because of the harassment he was subjected to); and' the initiation of disciplinary proceedings in which the penalty of dismissal was imposed on Mr Jos Pereira Orihuela, President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Roraima in , because he requested illegally stored explosives to be removed in an area under the supervision of the Federal Police Department of Roraima (FENAPEF reports that a lawsuit seeking reinstatement was initiated seven years ago).
.The FENAPEF notes that it is regrettable that an attitude of political persecution persists towards trade union officials within the authorities of the institution and that there is a failure to apply Convention No.  ratified by Brazil, or the police human rights  Directive' (guideline). According to the complainant, democratization of the federal police is needed to enable employees to fully exercise their citizenship rights, which is unfortunately still not the case.
.In its communication dated  June , the Government states that a draft bill on anti-union acts is being prepared and that the text is under discussion between the Ministry of Labour and Employment s team and the trade union leadership s Combat Command for anti-union practices, which aims to combat anti-union acts in the public and private sectors. The legal text on the subject will prevent and combat acts",-1,2011,Brazil
19,"that violate the exercise of freedom of association.
.Regarding the adequacy of Act No. / of , the Government states that, since it is a matter for the Ministry of Justice, it has been forwarded to it for any comments it may deem appropriate. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MTE) is willing to collaborate on conducting studies on the provisions that may not be in conformity with the new constitutional order. The Government adds that the MTE provides mediation services in labour disputes through the Labour Relations Secretariat.
.In its communications dated  August and  October , and  June , the Government states that it is first important to note that article  of the Federal Constitution guarantees the right to form professional or trade union associations and that this freedom encompasses not only the right to form unions and join or leave them, but also the exercise of trade union activities in the broadest sense. In this context, in order to protect the efficient performance of trade union activities, the legislative system sought to protect this activity through the creation of mechanisms to prohibit anti-union conduct (the Government reiterates the comments made in its earlier communication with respect to the ongoing discussions on the adoption of specific legislation in that regard). As for the public sector, article (VI) of the Federal Constitution guarantees freedom of association in that sector. The guarantees granted to trade union officials in the public sector differ from those granted to the private sector and are governed by different regulations. The Government states that, in order to reduce the differences between the public and private sectors, Convention No. , which was ratified by Brazil, was adopted. Following ratification, measures were adopted and discussions undertaken within the Executive to draft bills to regulate the matter; for example, issues such as trade union organization in the sector, trade union leave and combating anti-union acts were discussed.
.The Government maintains that, despite the absence of a legal standard dealing with the subject in detail, the Federal Constitution provides mechanisms to protect workers and trade union organizations, in particular through the principle of non-state intervention in trade union organizations. Thus, any acts aimed at impeding the free exercise of trade union activity must be investigated and punished through actions taken by public institutions such as the Public Ministry of Labour and the Judiciary.
.The Government states that, with respect to the allegations, there are legal means at the national level to resolve the alleged wrongdoings. The Government explains that in administrative disciplinary proceedings the principles of due process are respected, they do not have the force of res judicata and the outcome may be appealed in the courts. The Government underlines that it considers any anti-union act to be harmful and punishable and thus it is undertaking to develop, within the framework of a tripartite discussion, legislation establishing which anti-union acts are liable to punishment.
.The Committee observes that in this case the FENAPEF alleges that in carrying out trade union activities several of its officials suffered acts of anti-union discrimination by the police authorities. Specifically, the FENAPEF alleges: () the initiation of administrative disciplinary proceedings (a penalty of two days' suspension was imposed) and a police investigation into the alleged commission of the offences of insult and defamation against the organization s Communications Director, Mr Josias Fernandes Alves; () the initiation of three administrative disciplinary proceedings against the President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of the State of Baha, Ms Rejane Peres Teixera (according to the FENAPEF a petition for habeas corpus was filed in relation to this case); () the initiation of administrative disciplinary proceedings against Mr Julio Gomes de Carvalho Junio, an officer of the SINDIPOL/DF in ; () the initiation of administrative disciplinary proceedings against Mr Francisco Leodecio Neves, Deputy Director of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Paraiba in ; () the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against Mr Paulo Pimenta, Vice-President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Acre in ; and () the initiation of disciplinary proceedings in which the penalty of dismissal was imposed on Mr Jos Pereira Orihuela, President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Roraima in  (according to FENAPEF, a lawsuit seeking reinstatement was initiated seven years ago).
.The Committee notes that the Government states the following: () article  of the Federal Constitution guarantees professional or trade union freedom of association and that this freedom encompasses not only the right to form unions and join or leave them, but also the exercise of trade union activities in the broadest sense; () in order to protect the efficient performance of trade union activities, the legislative system sought to protect this activity through the creation of mechanisms to prohibit anti-union conduct; () as for the public sector, article (VI) of the Federal Constitution guarantees free trade union association in that sector; () a draft bill on anti-union acts is being prepared and the text is under discussion between the Ministry of Labour and Employment s team and the trade union leadership s Combat Command for anti-union practices, which aims to combat anti-union acts in the public and private sectors and the legal text on the subject will prevent and combat acts that violate the exercise of freedom of association; () the Federal Constitution provides mechanisms to protect workers and trade unions, in particular through the principle of non-state intervention in trade union organizations, thus any acts aimed at impeding the free exercise of trade union activity must be investigated and punished through actions taken by public institutions such as the Public Ministry of Labour and the Judiciary; () with respect to the allegations, there are legal means at the national level to resolve the alleged wrongdoings; () the Government explains that in administrative disciplinary proceedings the principles of due process are respected, they do not have the force of res judicata and the outcome may be appealed in the courts; and () the Government underlines that it considers any anti-union act to be harmful and punishable and thus it is undertaking to develop, within the framework of a tripartite discussion, legislation establishing which anti-union acts are liable to punishment.
.First of all, while taking due note that the Government, on a tripartite basis, proposes to develop a draft bill to prevent, investigate and combat anti-union activities, the Committee expects that the draft bill in question will shortly be submitted to the Executive and recalls that, if it so wishes, it can make use of ILO technical assistance in this process. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed thereof. The Committee invites the Government to take into account the principle according to which the right to express opinions through the press or otherwise is an essential aspect of trade union rights [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ].
.With regard to the specific alleged acts of anti-union discrimination against the six union officials, the Committee regrets that the Government has merely stated that the administrative disciplinary proceedings may be appealed in the courts and they respect the principles of due process. The Committee therefore requests the Government to report on the outcome of the administrative disciplinary proceedings concerning five trade union officials and whether appeals have been lodged in this regard. The Committee also regrets the delay in the reinstatement proceedings initiated seven years ago by the official Mr Jos Pereira Orihuela, President of the Union of Federal Police Officers of Roraima and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this case.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee expects that the draft bill on anti-union discrimination will shortly be submitted to the Executive and recalls that, if it so wishes, it can make use of ILO technical assistance in this process. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed thereof.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to inform it about the outcome of the administrative disciplinary proceedings concerning five union officials and whether appeals have been lodged in this regard.

20,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and on that occasion made the following recommendation:  The Committee urges the Government to immediately take all measures within its power to promote collective bargaining between the SUSPJESP and the authorities concerned, so that, taking into account the special modalities for the application of Convention No. , the public servants of the sector may exercise the right to collective bargaining. The Committee urges the Government to report on any measures taken in this regard.' [see nd Report, para. ].
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that: () the Ministry of Labour and Employment established the Industrial Relations Council on  November ; () it is a tripartite forum, the aim of which is to promote the democratization of industrial relations and understanding between workers, employers and the federal Government; () the Council promotes collective bargaining and social dialogue and its recommendations serve as guidance to the Ministry of Labour and Employment; () three bipartite committees were established within the Council (Government and Workers; Government and Employers; and Government and public officials) and in  the first meetings were held between the Government and Employers and between the Government and public officials; () the Government and Workers held three meetings and they are currently considering the issues of the representativeness of trade union confederations and anti-union acts and they plan to consider the issue of the inclusion in the labour market of trainees and persons with disabilities.
.The Committee takes note of this information. While it welcomes the initiative to establish a forum to promote collective bargaining and social dialogue, the Committee firmly expects that, in the very near future, the SUSPJESP and the authorities concerned, taking into account the special modalities for the application of Convention No. , will be able to exercise the right to collective bargaining.
.The General Union of Workers (UGT) presented a complaint in a communication of  June .
.Since there has been no reply from the Government, the Committee has been obliged to postpone its examination of the case on two occasions. At its meeting in May June  [see th Report, para. ], the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government indicating that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body (), it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting, even if the requested information or observations had not been received in time. To date, no information has been received from the Government.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the UGT indicates that for more than two years, the Union of Judiciary Employees of So Paulo State (SUSPJESP) has, without success, been presenting demands concerning a wage review to the So Paulo State Court of Justice and the Government of So Paulo State. The UGT indicates that, under these circumstances, on  April , judicial staff had no alternative but to resort to strike action. By going on strike, the public servants are trying to alert the Government and the State Court of Justice of the need to give immediate effect to Act No. /, which provides for the consideration on  March every year of all demands with financial implications.
.The UGT indicates that, in May , SUSPJESP filed a request for dissidio coletivo (arbitration) before the Special Body of the So Paulo State Court of Justice in relation to a strike and on that occasion the judicial authority violated the decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association in that regard, by: () establishing that  absences due to the participation of Court of Justice officials in strike action will result in deductions, without the possibility of compensation, from pay or from calculations relating to length of service or any other benefit'  () confirming  the ban on exercising the right to strike of public servants whose duties relate to the maintenance of public order and security or the administration of justice and of career state employees'  and () providing that  the union must refrain from promoting the total or partial stoppage of the activities carried out by the workers it represents, from the time of the notification of the decision, under penalty of a fine of , reais (BRL) per day, and the union and its officials are ordered, collectively, not to initiate other strikes before a final ruling is made with regard to the present arbitration procedure' 
.The Committee deplores the fact that, despite the time which has elapsed since the presentation of the complaint, the Government has not sent its reply concerning the allegations presented by the complainant organization, although it has been invited on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, to present its comments and observations on the case.
.Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a substantive report on the case without being able to take into account the information it has sought from the Government.
.The Committee recalls that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom in law and in fact. The Committee remains confident that, if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning allegations made against them. The Committee expects the Government to be more cooperative in future.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that the So Paulo State Court of Justice refuses to negotiate the demands presented by the SUSPJESP and also objects to the decision by the judicial authority in the context of a  dissidio coletivo' (arbitration) procedure requested by the SUSPJESP in relation to a strike, under which it was decided that strike days would be deducted and the union was ordered not to call further strikes until a final ruling is handed down by the judicial authority in relation to the arbitration procedure.
.With regard to the alleged refusal by the So Paulo State Court of Justice to negotiate the demands presented by the SUSPJESP, the Committee recalls that Brazil has ratified the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which provides in its Article  that it applies to all branches of economic activity and that, as regards the public service, special modalities of application of the Convention may be fixed by national laws or regulations or national practice. Under these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to immediately take all measures within its power to promote collective bargaining between the SUSPJESP and the authorities concerned, so that, taking into account the special modalities for the application of Convention No. , the public servants of the sector may exercise the right to collective bargaining. The Committee urges the Government to report on any measures taken in this regard.
.With regard to the contested decision by the judicial authority, which was adopted in the context of an arbitration request by SUSPJESP, under which it was decided that the strike days would be deducted and which called on the union not to call further strikes until a final ruling is handed down by the judicial authority in relation to the arbitration procedure, the Committee recalls that it has underlined, on numerous occasions, that  salary deductions for days of strike give rise to no objection from the point of view of freedom of association principles' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], and that in a context of voluntary arbitration, the fact that further industrial action cannot be taken until a final ruling is handed down is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association. Under these circumstances, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to immediately take all measures within its power to promote collective bargaining between the SUSPJESP and the authorities concerned, so that, taking into account the special modalities for the application of Convention No. , the public servants of the sector may exercise the right to collective bargaining. The Committee urges the Government to report on any measures taken in this regard.",-1,2010,Brazil
21,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Unitary Centre of Workers (CUT), the National Confederation of Financial Sector Workers (CONTRAF), the Federation of Credit Establishment Workers of So Paulo (FETEC/SP) and the Union of Employees of Bank Establishments of So Paulo dated  March .
.The Government sent partial observations in communications dated  October and  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , the CUT, the CONTRAF, the FETEC/SP and the Union of Employees of Bank Establishments of So Paulo state that collective bargaining by trade unions that represent Brazilian bank workers is carried out at a national level. Demands are discussed by a national delegation of workers of the banking sector, and by the National Federation of Banks (FENABAN), which represents the employers. The complainants indicate that the CONTRAF CUT, the FETEC/SP and the Union of Employees of Bank Establishments of So Paulo, are members of the national delegation of workers of the sector.
.The complainants indicate that where no agreement is reached between the parties, the workers exercise the right to strike as a way of putting pressure on the employers to reach an agreement to settle the dispute. The complainants indicate that during a strike, the workers set up  clarification commissions' whereby the bank workers on strike seek to provide information in an ordered and peaceful manner for bank employees and clients, and for the public in general, regarding the suspension of activities and the bank workers' demands.
.The complainants allege that, in these circumstances and aiming at obstructing and preventing bank workers from exercising the right to strike, the banks (belonging to FENABAN and listed by name in the complaint) seek prohibitory injunctions from the courts (and the corresponding court restraining orders), on the grounds that protection against this situation is needed. The complainants indicate that prohibitory injunctions are a typical civil law mechanism intended to protect private property against looting and disturbance, and that banks use them routinely to justify police repression or to withdraw bank workers' right to strike and of demonstration. The complainants add that this protection is sought before the courts as a preventive measure, prior to the interruption of activities, in order to obtain court rulings banning the trade unions from taking such actions. According to the complainants, most court orders authorize the use of police force.
.The complainant organizations indicate that the prohibitory injunctions requested by the banks ban union leaders from coming within  metres of the banks, and ban the use of banners, platforms and vehicles with sound-emitting loudspeakers. According to the complainants, these bans make it impossible to persuade workers peacefully to exercise the right to strike.
.The trade unions declare that their inability to carry out demonstrations against these banks is compounded by the State s intervention through the use of police force, with prior court authorization. On various occasions the police arrested union leaders and bank workers on strike, which was enough to hobble the trade union during the strike. The complainant organizations indicate that police intervention tends to involve excessive violence and impinges on the bank workers' right to peaceful demonstration.
.The complainant organizations further indicate that last year, members of the bank security sector of the Brazilian Federation of Banks, which includes FENABAN, met with members of the military police division of the state of So Paulo to plan joint actions against ongoing strikes. The government of the state of So Paulo tolerates actions that obstruct bank workers' right to strike. Moreover, the trade unions indicate that in addition to the violent police repression against strikers, court decisions impose daily fines on the trade unions in the sector that go from , to , reais. In practice, these fines paralyse the trade unions and hinder their financial survival. The complainants conclude that these prohibitory injunctions prevent workers from carrying out peaceful actions in the exercise of their right to strike.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government informs that on  September  a mediation session was held in which both government and trade union representatives participated, but which was not attended by any employer representatives. On that occasion a date was set for another session in October. In its communication of  November , the Government declares that the Labour Secretariat held a second mediation session between the parties on  October , without making any progress. In that session, the employers' representative requested the compilation of the banks' replies, and the CUT also requested the compilation of the relevant documents. The Government adds that it sent a communication to the government of the state of So Paulo and to the labour courts notifying them of the date of the mediation session but that there was no response regarding the issues under discussion.
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant organizations allege that in view of obstructing and preventing bank workers in the exercise of the right to strike, the FENABAN member banks seek prohibitory injunctions before the courts (with the corresponding court restraining orders) before the beginning of the strike, on the grounds that protection against looting is needed. The complainants add that the court restraining orders attached to the prohibitory injunctions ban union leaders from coming within  metres of the banks and ban the use of banners, platforms and vehicles with sound-emitting loudspeakers, and they authorize the intervention of the police, which frequently uses excessive violence; according to the allegations, the above is compounded by court orders imposing significant fines on the trade unions.
.The Committee notes that the Government declares that: () on  October a mediation session was held in which both government and trade union representatives participated, but which was not attended by representatives of the employer sector; () on that occasion, a date was set for another session in October and the Labour Secretariat held a second mediation session between the parties on  October , without making any progress; () in that session, the employers' representative requested the compilation of the banks' replies, and the CUT also requested the compilation of the relevant documents; and () a communication was sent from the Government to the government of the state of So Paulo and to the labour courts notifying them of the date of the mediation session, but there was no response regarding the issues under discussion.
.In this respect, the Committee observes that, according to the allegations, the prohibitory injunctions and the resulting court restraining orders prohibit the staging of strike pickets against the banks during strikes in the sector. The Committee recalls that on numerous occasions it has stressed that  the action of pickets organized in accordance with the law should not be subject to interference by the public authorities' and that  taking part in picketing and firmly but peacefully inciting other workers to keep away from their workplace cannot be considered unlawful. The case is different, however, when picketing is accompanied by violence or coercion of non-strikers in an attempt to interfere with their freedom to work' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , paras  and ]. Therefore, the peaceful exercise of the right to stage strike pickets in accordance with the above principles should not be enjoined or subject to sanctions. Under these terms, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the principles on the staging of strike pickets are respected and to communicate them to the relevant parties in the banking sector and in the Judiciary.
.On the other hand, as regards the alleged intervention of the police to enforce court restraining orders often with use of excessive violence ' which the Government has not denied in its reply ' the Committee observes that, according to the allegations, the police intervene even when pickets are conducted peacefully. In this respect, the Committee recalls that  the authorities should resort to calling in the police in a strike situation only if there is a genuine threat to public order. The intervention of the police should be in proportion to the threat to public order and governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities receive adequate instructions so as to avoid the danger of excessive violence in trying to control demonstrations that might undermine public order' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In light of this, the Committee requests the Government to ensure the respect of this principle.
.More generally, noting that the social partners are collecting information and documents regarding these issues in view of mediation, the Committee stresses the importance of making the issues set out in the complaint the subject of negotiations between the parties and invites the Government to continue taking measures in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee",-1,2010,Brazil
22,"requests the Government to ensure the respect of the principles regarding the staging of strike pickets referred to in the conclusions and to communicate them to the parties concerned in the dispute and to the Judiciary.(b)	More generally, noting that the social partners are gathering information and documents on the issues in this case, the Committee stresses the importance of making the issues set out in the complaint the subject of negotiations between the parties and invites the Government to continue taking measures in this respect.",-1,2010,Brazil
23,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Trade Union of Construction and Furniture Industry Workers of Bento Gonalves dated  January . The National Confederation of Industrial Workers (CNTI) supported the complaint in a communication of  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Trade Union of Construction and Furniture Industry Workers of Bento Gonalves stated, in its communication of  January , that it is a primary trade union organization representing workers in the construction and furniture industries, based in the municipalities of Bento Gonalves, Guzpar, Nova Araz, Nova Bassano, Para, Nova Prata, Veranpolis, Cotipora, Vila Flores, Fagundes Varela, So Jorge, Vista Alegre do Prata, Protsio Alves, Dois Lajeados, Guabiju, Montebelo do Sul, Santa Teresa, So Valentin do Sul and Unio da Serra, all of which are located in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The union in question is an important tradition in that region, having been founded  years ago and registered as a union on  October .
.The complainant organization alleges that on  July , it was informed of the dismissal of one of its officials, Mr Fbio Guiliherme de Oliveira, from the company Artesano Mveis Ltda, in violation of the principles of freedom of association. The official in question, who had been elected by direct workers' ballot, was a substitute member of the union s executive board since  January  and was to have carried on his mandate until  January . The official s candidacy, his election and assumption of the post of union official, was the subject of regular communication with the employer through official letters and published announcements in the company. He was very active and participated in representing workers, and was intensely committed to defending the interests of workers in the category in question.
.The complainant organization indicates that, during the period in which he represented workers, the official in question was called on by the union on six occasions to deal with issues of concern for this category of workers, and the employer was informed of his absences and unpaid leave provided for under section () of the Consolidated Labour Laws, proving not only the exercise of trade union activities but also the employer s tacit acceptance of his status as a union official. Moreover, as a result of the official s conspicuous leadership in the occupational category in question, he represented the union in a number of distinct activities, either union-related (meeting with government ministers, for example) or of a social nature (campaigns and meetings organized by the union). The official participated actively in the general assemblies of this category, both as a union official with voting rights and as an ordinary collaborator at meetings.
.The complainant organization maintains that the union official never committed any serious offences that might have justified his dismissal by the employer. In any case, even if he had committed any such offences, the correct procedure would not have been immediate dismissal but an investigation of the alleged offence, as provided for in Brazil s legislation, and his right to a defence should have been safeguarded. The complainant organization considers that the employer s insistence on dismissing the official was a punishment for his trade union activities and his unwavering defence of workers' rights. His dedicated and resolute representation of workers provoked the incomprehension and, on occasions, anger of his superiors, and he suffered discrimination for exercising his trade union mandate; all this ultimately led to his illegal and improper dismissal. The complainant organization considers that in a democratic State like Brazil, employers cannot be allowed to take abusive advantage of their managerial authority by violating rights of freedom of association, which are extensively protected and recognized by international law.
.In its communication of  September , the Government transmits a copy of the minutes of a hearing before the labour court, which notes that the parties in dispute reached an agreement by which the company undertook to pay the sum of , reales (R$) to Mr Fbio Guiliherme de Oliveira as compensation for his time as a union official. The Government also attaches a report by the General Coordination Office for Labour Relations which refers to ILO Conventions Nos  and  and to the Brazilian Constitution, which guarantees freedom of professional or trade union association, and suggests that the Rio Grande do Sul Regional Superintendence for Labour and Employment invite the parties in dispute to a mediation hearing with a view to considering the possibility of settling the dispute through administrative channels.
.The Government communicates the record of the conciliation meeting which took place on  August  before the Rio Grande do Sul Regional Superintendence for Labour and Employment, which shows that the mediator referred to the benefits for the parties concerned of re-establishing an employment relationship. In this regard, the minutes of the meeting indicate that the worker stated that the possibility of reinstatement required some thought over each possibility, as he currently works at another company and resides in another municipality. The legal counsellor for the company stated that in his view, it was not possible to reinstate the worker in the company, given that the latter has no interest in doing so and there exists a certified agreement with the judicial authority confirming the full payment of compensation to the worker. Taking this into consideration, the mediator considered that the mediation attempt could not proceed.
.The Committee observes that in the present case, the Trade Union of Construction and Furniture Industry Workers of Bento Gonalves alleges the anti-union dismissal on  July  of the union official Mr Fbio Guiliherme de Oliveira from the company Artesano Mveis Ltda.
.In this regard, while recalling that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ], the Committee takes note of the minutes, communicated by the Government, of a judicial mediation hearing which included the issue of reinstatement that took place on  September , which indicates that the union official in question and the company had reached agreement on compensation for dismissal, taking into account his status as a union official. The Committee further recalls, as a general principle, that no one should be subjected to anti-union discrimination because of legitimate trade union activities and the remedy of reinstatement should be available to those who are victims of anti-union discrimination and that, if reinstatement is not possible, the Government should ensure that the workers concerned are paid adequate compensation which would represent a sufficient dissuasive sanction for anti-trade union dismissals [see Digest, op. cit., paras  and ].
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,2010,Brazil
24,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see nd Report, paras ' ].
.The Government sent its observations in communications of  and  February .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that, at its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations [see nd Report, para. ]:(a)	The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the meetings between the National Coordinating Body for the Promotion of Freedom of Association (CONALIS) of the MPT and the representatives of the union confederations to discuss various issues such as those arising from the assistance contribution, and requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the initiative to establish a tripartite Council of Industrial Relations. The Committee reminds the Government that it may call upon ILO assistance in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned and are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b)	The Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations without delay on the allegation that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from holding strikes and engaging in protest action and, since it is a matter of concern to the country s trade union confederations, to initiate a dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on the issue. The Committee also urges the complainant organization to provide additional information and examples with regard to its allegations.(c)	The Committee invites the Government to consider taking the necessary measures for the ratification of Convention No. .
.In its communication dated  February , the Government sent a communication from the Public Labour Prosecutor s Office (MPT) relating to this case. The MPT states that the National Coordinating Body for the Promotion of Freedom of Association (CONALIS) of the MPT was established in  and since then has been operating as a channel of communication with trade unions and employers' representatives. There is a CONALIS representative in all of the MPT s units. The aim of CONALIS is to strengthen trade unions and create an environment that is conducive to the exercise of freedom of association.
.The MPT reports that CONALIS held numerous meetings with the trade unions to discuss various issues, such as the collection from both unionized and non-unionized workers of the contributions provided for in collective agreements and accords. The trade unions do not agree with the measures taken by the prosecutors aimed at declaring null and void such clauses of collective agreements. Section (IV) of Supplementary Act No.  of  May  provides that the MPT is authorized to propose through amparo proceedings (proceedings for the protection of constitutional rights) any measures that may be required to declare null and void a clause in a collective agreement, accord or contract that violates individual or collective freedoms or the inalienable individual rights of workers. The MPT states that the Federal Supreme Court explicitly confirmed the constitutionality of this provision. The question of the payment of assistance contributions by non-unionized workers is disputed by the MPT. The jurisprudence of the Federal Supreme Court and of the Higher Labour Court does not allow for the collection of such contributions.
.According to the MPT, it is worth noting that article  of the Constitution of Brazil guarantees not only  positive' freedom of association, but also  negative' freedom of association, by providing that no individual shall be obliged to join or remain a member of a union. Moreover, the jurisprudence of the Federal Supreme Court provides that the contribution to trade union confederations referred to in article  of the Constitution is applicable only to members of the respective trade union. The Higher Labour Court established that the Constitution, in its articles (XX) and (V), guarantees the right to freedom of association and the right to join trade unions. Any clause of an accord, collective agreement or standard which requires non-unionized workers to pay a confederation tax, assistance contribution, promotional contribution or suchlike to a trade union organization shall be deemed to be in contravention of such freedom or right. Any provision that does not conform to this limitation shall be declared null and void, and any sums irregularly withheld shall be returned to the workers concerned.
.The MPT adds that, at a meeting on  May , after several meetings with representatives of the trade union organizations and despite the jurisprudence in support of the MPT s measures against the collection of assistance contributions from non-unionized workers, CONALIS discussed the issue and approved Guidance No. , which provides that negotiated assistance contributions may be collected from all workers ' both unionized and non-unionized ' provided that such payments are approved at a general assembly that is convened for that purpose, that is widely publicized, at which the participation of both members and non-members is guaranteed, and that is held in a place and at a time that facilitates the attendance of workers, providing that the right to object is guaranteed, and that such objection may be indicated to the union by any means of communication, and that the principles of proportionality and rationality have been observed, including with regard to the time limit set for objections concerning the amount of the contribution.
.According to the MPT, the adoption of the guidance reflected the wishes of the trade union movement and took into account the need for a compromise between the institutions concerned, despite the total lack of support in the jurisprudence mentioned above. This decision was considered satisfactory by the unions, and it seemed that this would relieve the tension caused by the measures taken by the MPT in line with the jurisprudence in question. It was hoped that the MPT s guidance would give rise to new debate in the labour courts with a view to reviewing the jurisprudence on the collection of assistance contributions from non-unionized workers.
.The MPT reports that a feeling of resistance started to develop among the prosecutors towards the position adopted and harsh criticism was directed towards the guidance that had been approved. The criticism related to: (a) the abusive collection of the contribution from non-unionized workers, who were not effectively guaranteed the right to object; (b) the fact that workers were required to pay a compulsory contribution, regardless of their union membership; (c) the absence of any accountability by the unions, despite the public nature of the contribution; (d) the fact that the MPT s measures to prevent abuse were undermined; and (e) the absence of any moves by the labour courts to change the law. Furthermore, the trade union movement began to use Guidance No.  to argue against the action of prosecutors, which generated even greater tension. This created a need for it to be reviewed, and on  August , after extensive debate and consultation, the majority of the prosecutors decided to withdraw Guidance No. . Despite all the efforts made by CONALIS to find a compromise position in order to relieve the tension with the union movement in this regard, the outcome was not as expected.
.The MPT reports that a number of observations can be made with regard to the events that have taken place: () the dialogue between the MPT and the trade union movement should be ongoing; () the trade union movement has already been warned about and informed of the difficulties of adopting a position with regard to assistance contributions without there being changes to legislation and jurisprudence; () within the context of this dialogue, it was noted that, without modifying Brazil s trade union system, it will be difficult to accept the collection of assistance contributions from workers who are not members of trade unions, without the specific permission of those workers; and () the modification of Brazil s trade union system would involve the ratification of Convention No. , the adoption of legislation establishing criteria for union representation providing benefits to the most representative organizations, and the provision of a private trade union financing mechanism, which would allow non-unionized workers to contribute voluntarily in order to benefit from trade union action and the working conditions established through collective bargaining.
.The MPT adds that, in addition to the discussions on strengthening the union movement, the '  Programme' was created, which provides for the adoption of measures to ensure the representation of workers in enterprises with more than  employees, as provided for in article  of the Constitution. To date, very few enterprises guarantee the representation of workers and the trade union movement has not been making much effort to give effect to this constitutional provision, which is a fundamental right of all urban and rural workers. It is hoped that the implementation of this programme will help increase union representation",-1,2009,Brazil
25,"and improve the system until structural reforms are adopted. The representation of workers involves providing an important safeguard to prevent, among other things, anti-union practices, moral and sexual harassment and discrimination. Finally, the MPT reaffirms that it remains willing to keep the channel of communication between CONALIS and the trade union movement always open, so that they can work together to secure better working conditions and prevent abuse and actions that violate the rights enshrined in Brazil s legal system, especially in the Constitution and the ILO Conventions.
.The Committee recalls that, when it last examined this case at its November  meeting, it requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the meetings between CONALIS of the MPT and the representatives of the union confederations to discuss various issues such as those arising from the assistance contribution, and requested the Government to keep it informed with regard to the initiative to establish a tripartite Council of Industrial Relations.
.The Committee notes that the Government sent a communication from the MPT on this issue, reporting that: () CONALIS held numerous meetings with the trade union organizations to discuss various issues, such as the collection from both unionized and non-unionized workers of the contributions provided for in collective agreements and accords; () section (IV) of Supplementary Act No.  of  May  provides that the MPT is authorized to propose through amparo proceedings any measures that may be required to declare null and void a clause in a collective contract or agreement that violates individual or collective freedoms or the inalienable individual rights of workers; () the Federal Supreme Court explicitly confirmed the constitutionality of the provision in question and the jurisprudence of the Federal Supreme Court and of the Higher Labour Court does not allow for the collection of such contributions; () article  of the Constitution of Brazil guarantees not only  positive' freedom of association, but also  negative' freedom of association, by providing that no individual shall be obliged to join or remain a member of a union; () CONALIS discussed the issue and approved Guidance No. , which provides that negotiated assistance contributions may be collected from all workers ' both unionized and non-unionized ' provided that such payments are approved at a general assembly that is convened for that purpose, that is widely publicized, at which the participation of both members and non-members is guaranteed, and that is held in a place and at a time that facilitates the attendance of workers, providing that the right to object is guaranteed, and that such objection may be indicated to the union by any means of communication, and that the principles of proportionality and rationality have been observed, including with regard to the time limit set for objections concerning the amount of the contribution; () Guidance No.  received strong criticism in the MPT and on  August , after extensive debate and consultation with the majority of the prosecutors, a decision was made to withdraw it; () the dialogue between the MPT and the trade union movement should be ongoing and the trade union movement has already been warned about and informed of the difficulties of adopting a position with regard to assistance contributions without there being changes to the relevant legislation and jurisprudence; () within the context of this dialogue, it was noted that, without modifying Brazil s trade union system, it will be difficult to accept the collection of assistance contributions from workers who are not members of trade unions, without the specific permission of those workers; and () the modification of Brazil s trade union system would involve the ratification of Convention No. , the adoption of legislation establishing criteria for union representation providing benefits to the most representative organizations, and the provision of a private trade union financing mechanism, which would allow non-unionized workers to contribute voluntarily in order to benefit from trade union action and the working conditions established through collective bargaining.
.First of all, the Committee takes note with interest of the initiatives taken by CONALIS of the MPT to promote and maintain a dialogue with the trade union movement on the issue of the collection of assistance contributions from non-unionized workers who benefit from a collective agreement. Taking into account that, as indicated by the MPT, the legislative provisions on that issue and the jurisprudence of the Federal Supreme Court and the Higher Labour Court that do not allow for the collection of such contributions are a source of tension in the trade union movement, the Committee trusts that the dialogue initiated by CONALIS with the trade union movement will continue and that, in that context, consideration will be given to the comments made by the Committee when it examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras  and ]. More specifically, the Committee recalls that it has on many occasions ruled on union security clauses, including those which provide for the payment of contributions by non-unionized workers as an expression of solidarity with unions that conclude a collective agreement. In dealing with this issue, the Committee has referred to the discussions that took place at the International Labour Conference when it adopted the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). On that occasion, the Committee on Industrial Relations of the International Labour Conference, taking into consideration the debate which it had held on the issue of union security clauses, finally agreed to recognize that the Convention should not be interpreted as authorizing or prohibiting union security arrangements, such matters being matters for regulation in accordance with national practice [see st Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Peru), para. , quoting ILO, Record of Proceedings, ILC, nd Session, , p. ]. In the light of that decision, the Committee considers that problems arising out of union security clauses must be resolved at the national level, according to the practice and labour relations system of each country. In other words, both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where these are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association [see th Report, Case No.  (the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), paras ' ]. With regard to the question of salary deductions agreed to in a collective agreement that is applicable to non-unionized workers who benefit from a union s activities, the Committee recalls that it has stated in the past that, when legislation admits trade union security clauses, such as the withholding of trade union dues from the wages of non-members benefiting from the conclusion of a collective agreement, those clauses should only take effect through collective agreements [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee reminds the Government once again that it may call upon ILO assistance in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned and are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee recalls that, when it examined this case at its November  meeting, it requested the Government to send its observations without delay on the allegation that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from holding strikes and engaging in protest action and urged it to initiate a dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on the issue. The Committee also requested the complainant organizations to provide additional information and examples with regard to its allegations. The Committee regrets that neither the Government nor the complainant organizations have sent observations in this regard and under these circumstances will not pursue the examination of this allegation.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	The Committee trusts that the dialogue initiated by CONALIS of the MPT with the trade union movement in relation to the issue of collecting assistance contributions from non unionized members who benefit from a collective agreement will continue and that the Committee s principles on the issue will be taken into account in this regard. The Committee reminds the Government once again that it may call upon ILO assistance in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned and are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b)	The Committee once again invites the Government to consider taking the necessary measures for the ratification of Convention No. .
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' ]. At its meeting in June , the Committee made an urgent appeal to the Government and drew its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body in its th Session (November ), it could present a report on the substance",-1,2009,Brazil
26,"of this case at its next meeting if the Government s observations or information had not been received in time. To date no information has been received from the Government.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that in its November  meeting, it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the meetings between the CONALIS of the MPT and the representatives of the union confederations to discuss various issues such as those arising from the assistance contribution, and requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the initiative to establish a tripartite Council of Industrial Relations. The Committee reminds the Government that it may call upon ILO assistance in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned and are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay on the allegation that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from holding strikes and engaging in protest action and, since it is a matter of concern to the country s trade union confederations, to initiate a dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on the issue. The Committee also requests the complainant organization to provide additional information and examples with regard to its allegations.(c) The Committee invites the Government to consider taking the necessary measures for the ratification of Convention No. .
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed since the last examination of the case, the Government has not provided the information requested, despite being urged to provide its observations or information regarding the case on a number of occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal. Under these circumstances and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee finds itself obliged to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to ensure respect for trade union freedoms both in law and in fact; this Committee is therefore convinced that, as the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognize the importance of formulating, for objective examination, detailed replies concerning the substance of the allegations made against them [see First Report of the Committee, para. ].
.Under these circumstances, the Committee finds itself obliged to reiterate the recommendations it made when it examined this case at its meeting in November  [see th Report, para. ]. The Committee expects that in the future the Government will actively cooperate by providing the information or observations requested.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee again invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the meetings between the National Coordinating Body for the Promotion of Freedom of Association of the State Labour Prosecutor (CONALIS of the MPT) and the representatives of the union confederations to discuss various issues such as those arising from the assistance contribution, and requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the initiative to establish a tripartite Council of Industrial Relations. The Committee reminds the Government that it may call upon ILO assistance in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned and are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b) The Committee once again requests the Government to send its observations without delay on the allegation that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from holding strikes and engaging in protest action and, since it is a matter of concern to the country s trade union confederations, to initiate a dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on the issue. The Committee also urges the complainant organization to provide additional information and examples with regard to its allegations.(c) The Committee invites the Government to consider taking the necessary measures for the ratification of Convention No. .
.The complaint was presented in a communication dated  November  from the Syndicalist Force (SF), the New Trade Union Centre of Brazilian Workers (NCST), the General Union of Workers (UGT), the Unitary Centre of Workers (CUT), the Brazil Workers' Centre (CTB) and the General Centre of Workers of Brazil (CGTB). The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) supported the complaint in a communication dated  November .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  December  and  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  November , SF, the NCST, the UGT, the CUT, the CTB and the CGTB state that the State Labour Prosecutor (MPT) (an independent body separate from both executive and judiciary) has been interfering in the affairs of primary, secondary and tertiary level trade unions through administrative and judicial channels. They further allege that the Office of the Public Prosecutor has initiated legal proceedings against trade unions. Moreover, the judiciary has been handing down rulings that constitute acts of interference and interference in trade union affairs. The complainants assert that through this interference and intervention the entire judicial and allied apparatus is seeking actively to dismantle workers' organizations without any apparent reason.
.The complainants state that article  of the Constitution stipulates that the MPT is a permanent institution and an essential jurisdictional projection of the State; as such, it is responsible for defending the legal system, democratic order and the interests of society and of the individual. They claim that the MPT, in disregard of the mandate conferred on it by the legislature, has been extending its authority beyond the limits of its competence and reinterpreting workers' rights. Specifically, the MPT is interpreting freedom of association from the pseudo-utilitarian standpoint of  Brazilian-style freedom of association' and has been initiating court proceedings against workers' organizations and calling on the judiciary to revoke clauses that were the product of collective bargaining.
.These measures are accompanied by requests for penalties that are so high as to oblige trade unions to close down. The complainants cite numerous examples of the MPT s anti-union interference in collective agreement clauses concerning union contributions, in the fining of trade unions, in decisions that look upon the payment of assistance contributions as violating the principles of freedom of association, etc. In their opinion, the MPT, in bringing cases before the judiciary that are designed to interfere with the financial viability of trade unions, is acting neither in accordance with the law nor with the Constitution, but on the basis of decisions handed down by the judiciary ' such as Federal Supreme Court s smula No.  (a  smula' is a summarization of case law of the higher courts that is intended to standardize the interpretation of the law) and the earlier standard No.  issued by the Higher Labour Court. The complainants contend that the judiciary s interference in trade union affairs is a violation of the principle of freedom of association embodied in the ILO s Conventions and in article  of the Brazilian Constitution, as well as of the principle of the separation of the three state powers. The MPT, the Office of the Public Prosecutor and the judiciary are undermining and debasing the principle of freedom of association by interfering directly in the continued existence of the trade union and in their internal management. Such state intervention violates the principle of freedom of association both nationally and internationally.
.The complainants state that, in addition to the MPT s initiation of court proceedings in order to weaken trade unions and prevent them from functioning by meddling in their financial administration, the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo is trying to prevent them from engaging in strikes and protest action by taking them to court, where the State is invariably awarded damages.
.The complainants add that the judiciary is encouraging the MPT and the Public Prosecutor in their crusade by handing down sentences that threaten trade unionism as a whole. For instance, the Federal Supreme Court has issued smula No. , in which it states that the contribution to trade union confederations referred to in article .IV of the Constitution is applicable only to members of the relevant trade unions. The Higher Labour Court, for its part, has issued decision No.  concerning assistance contributions, which reads as follows:  Articles .XX and .V, of the Constitution",-1,2009,Brazil
27,"guarantee freedom of association and the right to join trade unions. Any clause in an accord, collective agreement or standard which provides for the payment to a trade union by non-unionized workers of a confederation tax, assistance contribution, promotional contribution or suchlike shall be deemed to be in contravention of such freedom or right. Any provision that does not conform to this restriction is hereby declared null and void, and any sums irregularly withheld shall be returned to the workers concerned.' The complainants state that regional courts have issued rulings to the same effect. (They cite a number of regional court rulings declaring null and void the clauses of collective agreements that provide for the payment of assistance contributions by non-unionized workers, in which the MPT is cited as plaintiff.)
.The complainants state that the evidence put forward shows that the rulings completely ignore the decisions adopted at general assemblies, which are the supreme, sovereign trade union bodies. The method adopted by the MPT is to convene the presidents of the trade unions for a hearing at the MPT, at which they are presented with a procedural adjustment agreement. Then, somewhere between blackmail and bullying, the union officials are pressured into signing the agreement, often without even a lawyer present to explain the situation or to defend them against the threat that they will be charged with all kinds of misdemeanours if they do not sign, and fined accordingly. These procedural adjustment agreements impose a number of commitments, such as not claiming contributions from members and non-members of the  trusteeship' of union activities. The complainants emphasize that the general meeting that authorizes the workers' representatives to engage in negotiations with the employers' organizations was attended by the workers in the industry and not only the union members, since all the workers benefit from the concessions obtained. For a union leader to go to the MPT and renounce these concessions without the consent of the rank and file is therefore absurd.
.The complainants feel that this way of proceeding shows how weak the case is for arguing that the payment of a contribution violates freedom of association, since general meetings are open to all workers of the category concerned and every vote has the same weight as that of union members. Besides, all the concessions obtained over the years thanks to the efforts of the union benefit all the workers in the category, whether or not they attend the meetings and whether or not they are union members, which proves that the payment of an assistance contribution by all the workers, irrespective of union affiliation, is necessary for the smooth conduct of the discussions that unions engage in and in their efforts to defend the interests of a professional category.
.The complainants add that the assistance contributions referred to are scheduled under article (e) of the Consolidated Labour Laws Act and are governed by collective agreements and union by-laws. Article  stipulates that it is a prerogative of the trade unions to require contributions from all workers of the economic or professional categories and of the liberal professions that they represent. For the complainants, the assistance contributions are clearly legitimate and are recognized in the Consolidated Labour Laws Act as well as in article  of the Constitution concerning collective labour agreements.
.Moreover, they consider that the MPT is violating the sovereign right of the general meeting of workers' organizations to take such a decision, as they are legally protected under article .IV of the Constitution. The MPT s interference is a violation of freedom of association, in that it directly inhibits the ability of trade unions to adopt their own financial regulations and assure their financial viability. The judiciary and the MPT refuse to recognize that each union defends a whole category of workers, whether or not they are union members.
.The complainants emphasize that unions in Brazil represent categories of workers, as laid down in article  of the Consolidated Labour Laws Act and article  of the Constitution. Representation by category presupposes that all the concessions and benefits obtained ' whether higher salaries or better working conditions ' are extended to all the workers concerned irrespective of union membership. This is a significant achievement, as it means that workers who cannot join trade unions because of their employers' opposition enjoy the same advantages as union members, thanks to the erga omnes effect of collective bargaining. The same, therefore, should apply to the unions' financial support, though the State authorities that the present complaint is directed at contend that the unions' costs should be borne only by their members. This is a source of anti-union discrimination which encourages affiliated workers to cancel their membership.
.The anti-union practices engaged in by the MPT and by the judiciary are intended to undermine the decision of the workers' general meeting, whereas employers' organizations are at liberty to set whatever contributions they wish without any state interference. The complainants conclude by requesting the Committee to contemplate sending a direct contacts mission to collect information, engage a dialogue and help resolve the issues raised in the allegations.
.With its communication dated  December , the Government attaches the observations of the MPT. Through its representative, the MPT states that under the Labour Laws Consolidation Act of  the main features of Brazil s labour legislation were: excessive state intervention in both legislative and administrative affairs, trade union monopoly with a mandatory  union tax'  severe restrictions on the right to strike, and the standard-setting power of the labour courts. The emphasis on the individual protection of workers' interests through the labour legislation meant that the collective protection of their interests by trade unions was given less importance. The political opening up that began in the years prior to the adoption of the  Constitution has to be seen from the standpoint of the country s external debt, the succession of economic crises and the pressure of the global market. The Government s response was to introduce measures to make labour law more flexible, and trade unions were expected to adapt to the new rules and regulations while at the same time avoiding the kind of abuses that could lead to a decline in working conditions at a time when the State was focusing on its economic woes. To be able to assume these new responsibilities, trade unions needed to be free and strong and their leaders had to adopt a fresh approach.
.Brazil s  Constitution, based as it is on the dignity of the human person and on democratic principles, modified significantly the union structure that had existed for decades past. The MPT assumed a leading role in defending the workers' inalienable social and individual interests, especially their fundamental rights. So it is completely untrue, and contrary to the MPT s very mandate, to accuse it of violating a basic right such as freedom of association. According to the MPT, the complainant organizations are trying to do away with any kind of check that might be imposed on them in order to prevent some of their leaders from going off the rails.
.The MPT asserts that article  of the Constitution guaranteed union autonomy vis--vis the State and protection from  negative' freedom of association, while maintaining the ban on the establishment of more than one union for each economic activity (i.e. the principle of trade union monopoly) as the basis of the union movement, the existence of federations and confederations as the higher level organizations and the levy of union membership dues in addition to the mandatory contribution required from all workers, irrespective of union membership. The maintenance of a trade union monopoly for each category and the introduction of a mandatory contribution were designed to prevent the break up and weakening of the Brazilian unions. However, this cannot continue indefinitely to be the juridical framework for trade unionism in Brazil, since it is not in conformity with the fundamental principles of freedom of association as laid down by the ILO. So long as the Constitution maintains the principle of trade union monopoly and of a mandatory contribution, there is always the possibility that unions will negotiate unfavourable conditions for the workers in exchange for special benefits for the union leaders and that membership dues will be used for the latter s personal benefit or to finance partisan political objectives.
.The MPT explains that, in addition to state financing of the trade union movement by means of the mandatory contribution payable by all workers, unions continue to levy the union dues provided for in article .IV of the Constitution, as well as an assistance contribution. This was originally meant to function like the solidarity contribution that is found in some European countries, the idea being that non-unionized workers contribute to a union that negotiates better working conditions for them, i.e. an expression of their solidarity with union members and with the union itself in recognition of the services it renders. According to the Federal Supreme Court, which is the highest",-1,2009,Brazil
28,"authority for interpreting the Constitution, union dues are not strictly speaking a tax and can therefore be levied only on a union s members. The assistance contribution was examined by the Higher Labour Court, the country s highest labour court, which decided that it should be paid by union members (standard No.  mentioned above and case law guideline No.  relating to collective labour disputes). The case law cited was not intended to restrict the ability of trade unions to defend the workers but, on the contrary, sprang from the need to prevent the practice frequently indulged in by certain  shadow' trade unions which have no members, serve merely as a screen for obtaining financial resources, have no commitment to the rank and file and can easily be manipulated by enterprises to make the provisions of labour law more flexible.
.The MPT states that, there are of course a significant number of militant representative trade unions that call strikes and obtain concessions for the workers. When the MPT comes across practices or clauses that contravene the laws and regulations in force, some of its attorneys feel duty bound to enforce compliance in line with the interpretation handed down by the courts. Often it is the workers themselves (who pay their assistance or compulsory contribution through the MPT where the collective labour agreements are registered) who request the MPT s intervention. In these cases the MPT is simply following the court s guidelines. Currently, the MPT s officials are trying to introduce a process of formal dialogue with the trade unions to resolve the various issues surrounding the proper exercise of freedom of association.
.The MPT states that on  May , a National Coordinating Body for the Promotion of Freedom of Association (CONALIS) was set up with the participation of representatives of the MPT s units throughout the country. One of the CONALIS' strategic objectives is to guarantee freedom of association and to resolve collective labour disputes. For the MPT, a genuinely democratic society is possible only if all sectors comply with the principles embodied in the Constitution, and especially with one as important as the matter of labour relations. Hence, the need for the MPT to contribute to the democratization of the trade union movement and for its strategy of strengthening both the organizations themselves and the collective bargaining process and of striving to eliminate anti-union discrimination. On  August , CONALIS held its first nationwide meeting, which the presidents of all the trade union confederations were invited to attend. Participants were thus able to express their views on what the movement, as a whole, expected from the new body and on the MPT s handling of the whole issue since its creation. Through this process of dialogue a large number of contacts and meetings were organized with the leaders of the union confederations to discuss a broad range of issues, including the assistance contribution, the banning of strikes and the threats on the lives of union officials.
.The MPT emphasizes that it has been discussing a range of issues of concern to the workers and to society by promoting ongoing social dialogue and holding bipartite or tripartite meetings before it reaches its decisions. It considers that the complaint under examination is extremely important, as it provides the ILO with an overall picture of the problem of trade unionism in Brazil. The State must, at all times, consider the consequences of its actions and make sure that it is achieving its goals, even if this means reviewing its approach in the matter. Unless there is a change of culture in the trade union movement and a change of perspective by its leaders, it is the workers themselves who will suffer most. The complaint under examination could serve as a means of convincing union leaders to agree to Brazil s ratification of Convention No. , which the unions' opposition has so far unfortunately prevented from taking place.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that great progress has been achieved for the working class and that employment and growth are at record highs every month. It indicates that these achievements are the fruit of the struggle of workers, represented by their unions, who sought to avoid lay-offs in times of crisis and to obtain better working conditions.
.The Government adds that the single paragraph of article  of the Federal Constitution of Brazil states that the power emanates from the people and will be exercised on its behalf. For this reason, the constituents who drafted the Federal Constitution in  were supported by the popular vote and were required to draft a democratic constitution that takes into account the immediate and medium-term needs of the Brazilian people. Thus, the provisions on freedom of association and unity, which restrict the territorial base to at least a municipality, aim to prevent the formation of trade unions against the interests of workers and weaken the combative entities. In the same vein, article  of the Constitution provides several progressive measures, such as the prohibition of intervention and state interference in trade union affairs, freedom of association ' maintaining trade union unity at the territorial level corresponding to at least one municipality, compulsory trade union dues to continue to ensure the independence of unions and the recognition of the right to strike and the trade right to officials.
.Regarding the assistance contributions, the Government indicates that it is not a tax, since, if that had been the case, workers would not have been able to oppose it. The Government acknowledges the existence of conflicts in relation to such contributions and reaffirms its willingness to improve the dialogue with the unions and organizations representing employers in order to find a legal mechanism to effectively regulate this matter. The Government states that, in the framework of the National Labour Forum (FNT), the creation of a negotiated contribution has been proposed, pursuant to which all workers in the same category should pay in case of concluding a collective agreement, thereby eliminating the compulsory contribution in the Constitution. The Government states that, due to lack of consensus and the fact that this issue is a source of conflict in itself, this proposal was not acted upon. The Government adds that, in order to refine and strengthen democracy in industrial relations, it proposed the creation of a Council of Industrial Relations of tripartite composition where these types of issues could be examined.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations raise objections to the measures adopted by the MPT and to the decisions handed down by the judiciary revoking clauses in collective agreements with respect to the payment of assistance contributions by all workers covered by an agreement, including non-unionized workers, because of the erga omnes effect of collective bargaining. They also allege that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from engaging in protest action.
.The Committee notes that the Government has sent the observations of the MPT, whose representative states that: () under the Labour Laws Consolidation Act of , the main features of Brazil s labour regulations were: excessive state intervention in both legislative and administrative affairs, trade union monopoly with a mandatory  union tax'  severe restrictions on the right to strike, and the standard-setting power of the labour courts; () the political opening-up that began in the years prior to the adoption of the  Constitution have to be seen from the standpoint of the country s external debt, successive economic crises and the pressure of the global market and, consequently, measures have been introduced to make labour law more flexible and trade unions are expected to adapt to the new rules and regulations while at the same time avoiding the kind of abuses that could lead to a decline in working conditions at a time when the State was focusing on its economic woes; () if they are to assume their new responsibilities, trade unions need to be free and strong and their leaders have to adopt a fresh approach; () Brazil s  Constitution, based as it is on the dignity of the human person and on democratic principles, modified significantly the union structure that had existed for decades past; () the MPT has assumed a leading role in defending the workers' inalienable social and individual interests, especially their fundamental rights, and so it is completely untrue, and contrary to the MPT s very mandate, to accuse it of violating a right as fundamental as freedom of association; () the maintenance of a trade union monopoly for each category and the introduction of a mandatory contribution were designed to prevent the break up and weakening of the Brazilian unions, but this cannot continue indefinitely to be the juridical framework for trade unionism in Brazil, since it is not in conformity with the fundamental principles of freedom of association as laid down by the ILO; () with the maintenance of trade union monopoly and of a",-1,2009,Brazil

The Government indicates that this proposal was not acted upon due to lack of consensus and the fact that this issue remains a source of conflict; and () to refine and strengthen democracy in industrial relations, the Government proposes the creation of a Council of Industrial Relations, a tripartite body where these types of issues could be examined.
.The Committee recalls that it has on many occasions ruled on union security clauses, including those which provide for the payment of contributions by non-unionized workers as an expression of solidarity with unions that conclude a collective agreement. In dealing with this issue, the Committee has referred to the discussions that took place at the International Labour Conference when it adopted the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). On that occasion, the Committee on International Relations of the International Labour Conference, taking into consideration the debate which it had held on the issue of union security clauses, finally agreed to recognize that the Convention should not be interpreted as authorizing or prohibiting union security arrangements, such matters being matters for regulation in accordance with national practice [see st Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Peru), para. , quoting ILO, Record of Proceedings, ILC, nd Session, , p. ]. In the light of that ruling, the Committee considers that problems arising out of union security clauses must be resolved at the national level, according to the practice and labour relations system of each country. In other words, both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where these are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association [see th Report, Case No.  (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), paras ' ].
.Regarding the question of salary deductions agreed to in a collective agreement that is applicable to non-unionized workers who benefit from a union s activities, the Committee has stated in the past that, when legislation admits trade union security clauses, such as the withholding of trade union dues from the wages of non-members benefiting from the conclusion of a collective agreement, those clauses should only take effect through collective agreements [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ].
.Bearing in mind that the Government recognizes the existence of conflicts in relation to this type of assistance contribution, as well as the apparent contradiction between the interpretation of the legislation by the judiciary and the statement of the complainant organizations to the effect that it is legally permissible to impose an assistance contribution on non-unionized workers who benefit from a collective agreement, and observing that the CONALIS of the MPT has held meetings with representatives of the union confederations to discuss various issues such as those arising from the assistance contribution, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the aforementioned meetings, as well as of the initiatives to establish a tripartite Council of Industrial Relations. The Committee reminds the Government that it may call upon ILO assistance in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned and that are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. Finally, the Committee invites the Government to consider taking the necessary measures for the ratification of Convention No. .
.Regarding the allegation that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from holding strikes and engaging in protest action, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the subject without delay and, since it is a matter of concern to the country s trade union confederations, to initiate a dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on the issue. The Committee also requests the complainant organization to provide additional information and examples concerning its allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the meetings between the CONALIS of the MPT and the representatives of the union confederations to discuss various issues such as those arising from the assistance contribution, and requests the Government to keep it informed with regard to the initiative to establish a tripartite Council of Industrial Relations. The Committee reminds the Government that it may call upon ILO assistance in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned and are in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations without delay on the allegation that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of So Paulo has initiated legal proceedings to prevent trade unions from holding strikes and engaging in protest action and, since it is a matter of concern to the country s trade union confederations, to initiate a dialogue with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations on the issue. The Committee also requests the complainant organization to provide additional information and examples with regard to its allegations.(c) The Committee invites the Government to consider taking the necessary measures for the ratification of Convention No. .",-1,2009,Brazil
30,".The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it requested the Government to keep it informed as to whether the complaint made to the police against union leader Mr Paulo Roberto Fier had been withdrawn under the written undertaking that the company had signed with the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour and, if not, to keep it informed of the status of the complaint and whether legal proceedings had been initiated [see th Report, para. ' ].
.In a communication dated  March , the Government sent information from the company concerned indicating that the complaint made to the police against union leader Mr Paulo Roberto Fier has been withdrawn under the written undertaking signed with the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour, with the consequence therefore that no civil or penal charges are brought, or have ever been brought, against him.
.The Committee takes note of the information with interest.
.The present complaint is contained in communications from the Union of Workers in the Petro-Chemical Industries of the State of Paran (SINDIQUIMICA-PR), dated  April and  June . In a communication of  June , the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT) supported the complaint. The complainant organization SINDIQUIMICAPR sent additional information in a communication of  July .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  December .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of June , the SINDIQUIMICA-PR makes allegations concerning violations of trade union rights and in particular anti-union acts in the enterprise Fosfrtil/Ultrafrtil, which is engaged in fertilizer-related activities. Specifically, the complainant organization alleges that the enterprise: () prohibits the entry of union officials who wish to talk with the workers (it refers by way of example to the case of Mr Otemio Garca de Lima); () discriminated against union officials Mr Ubirajara de Carvalho and Mr Albino Filla Filho in their personal appraisals; () dismissed worker Mr Anselmo Sukewski without cause, because of his friendship with union officials, and () harassed union official Mr Luiz Castellano. The complainant organization adds that, in view of the growing instability of working conditions and the lack of respect for workers, a strike was called in January , involving the participation of  per cent of workers, during which the right to work of non-strikers was respected. However, the complainant organization alleges that the enterprise engaged in acts of coercion and intimidation and detained workers for  hours, forcing them to sleep at the workplace, which led to legal action and the imposition of administrative fines.
.In its communication of  July , the complainant organization alleges that the enterprise has committed further acts of anti-union discrimination since the presentation of the complaint. Specifically, it indicates that, three days after a public hearing was held over the illegal acts committed by the enterprise, a demonstration was held outside the factory on  May , organized by various civil society organizations. Days later, the enterprise reported union official Mr Paulo Roberto Fier to the police, holding him responsible for the demonstration and for having threatened the workers who wanted to enter the factory. According to the complainant organization, this was an unjustified act of intimidation, given that the demonstration had been organized by a group of  organizations that comprise the committee for the defence of farmers and workers of Fosfrtil/Ultrafrtil. The complainant organization also alleges that, on  June , civil society organizations held another demonstration outside the factory and that, in an attempt to intimidate the workers, the enterprise issued a warning to the unionists Mr Paulo Roberto Fier and Mr Sergio Luiz Monteiro because they did not come in to work on time. The complainant organization states that no workers came in for the morning shift because of the demonstration and because the enterprise had closed its points of entry. Nevertheless, the warning was issued only to workers who had been members of the union s executive committee.
.In its communications dated  December , the Government sent the observations of the enterprise in relation to the case, as well as a written undertaking entered into by the enterprise Fosfrtil/Ultrafrtil and the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour on  November .
.In its communication, the enterprise refers to its history, its integration into the domestic market and its human resources policy in terms of development, pay, benefits and quality of life. Likewise, the enterprise indicates with regard to its policy on trade union relations that it: () has a perfect understanding of the duality of the relationship between labour and capital and the importance of maintaining an ongoing high-level dialogue with the trade unions; () respects the dignity of its workers, the social values of work and the exercise of free enterprise; () has favoured a policy that recognizes the importance of unions and their officials; () has reached three collective agreements over the years, and in  years of intense relations with the union there have been no disputes that have required recourse to justice; () proportionately, probably has the highest rate of affiliation in Brazil; and () has respected and recognized the legitimacy of unions, their officials and members and there has been a union official on the board of the enterprise since .
.As to the allegations presented in this case, the enterprise indicates that: () it did not refuse the union officials entry to the industrial estate, as is demonstrated by the log book recording the entry of union officials to the industrial estate, and the enterprise made a proposal to the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour to enter into an agreement on conduct in this regard, before it knew about the complaint; () it never acted in a discriminatory way with regard to the appraisal of trade union officials. Although one of the enterprise s supervisors incorrectly conducted five performance appraisals, the employees were informed in writing that these appraisals would not be taken into account and the supervisor had been sent on a retraining course; () no punitive measures are taken against union officials for exercising trade union activities. The significant number of unionized workers and union officials is proof of this. There has only been one case where, during a dismissal interview, a supervisor indicated that the employee was a trade union activist. The supervisor was issued with a warning by the enterprise and no further cases of this kind have been recorded; () no acts of intimidation have been carried out against a union official. For medical reasons, it was recommended that the person in question should leave the areas that were at risk ' this had nothing to do with trade union politics; and () striking workers were never held. The enterprise had planned to carry out some general maintenance work in January  and had therefore called on workers from other plants and had put them up in hotels in the city of Araucaria. These workers were used to meet emergency service requirements and they were never shut in. The complainant organization knew that the maintenance work would be carried out, but it still called the strike. The enterprise recognizes the right to strike, but requires the presence of a skeleton staff to ensure the safety of workers and the community. The enterprise states that it has not violated any international Conventions and that respect is shown for environmental and occupational health issues.
.Finally, the enterprise reports that, before submitting the complaint to the Committee, the complainant organization lodged a similar complaint with the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour, which led to Investigation No. /. Within the context of this procedure, the enterprise signed a written undertaking (mentioned above) in which it made a public commitment to refrain from any anti-union acts.
.In the written undertaking, the enterprise makes a commitment among other things: () to handle all complaints using the existing institutional mechanisms (ethics committee and union representation together with the Board of Directors), take decisions regarding the prevention and/or elimination of harassment, and handle complaints discreetly, ensuring that the complainant and witnesses are not subjected to acts of repression as a result of the claim; () to ensure that information is made widely available within the enterprise, by putting notices on the walls, on the mechanisms that are in place to receive complaints of harassment; () to refrain from any discriminatory conduct that violates the right to equality, prohibiting the consideration of whether or not a worker is a member of a union or has links with a union as a factor in the evaluation or promotion of employees, or as a justification for dismissal; () to refrain from relocating/transferring employees, even within the same establishment, under the pretext of punishment or isolation; () to refrain from carrying out acts that constitute coercion or the curtailment of freedom of association,",-1,2008,Brazil
31,"allowing union officials access to the enterprise at least once a week, by agreement with the union, and adhering to occupational safety rules; () to refrain from asking that a specific reason be provided for the union visits, taking into account that the union may simply be interested in contacting the workers without a prior specific reason; () to allow dialogue between the workers and union officials to take place without a representative of the enterprise being present, in communal areas on the premises but away from the areas in which the work is carried out, in order to avoid occupational safety hazards; () the signature of the agreement does not imply any acknowledgement with regard to the complaints that have been filed; () for breach of the obligations provided for in the undertaking, the enterprise must pay a fine of , Brazilian reais, duly adjusted; and () the undertaking is subject to inspection by the regional labour inspectorate and/or the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that various violations of trade union rights took place in the enterprise Fosfrtil/Ultrafrtil, and in particular that the enterprise: () prohibits the entry of union officials who wish to talk with the workers (it refers by way of example to the case of Mr Otemio Garca de Lima); () discriminated against union officials Mr Ubirajara de Carvalho and Mr Albino Filla Filho in their personal appraisals; () dismissed worker Mr Anselmo Sukewski without cause, because of his friendship with union officials; and () harassed union official Mr Luiz Castellano; () during a strike in January , held workers for  hours, forcing them to sleep at the workplace, which led to legal action and the imposition of administrative fines; and () reported union official Mr Paulo Roberto Fier to the police, holding him responsible for a demonstration on  May  and for having threatened the workers who wanted to enter the factory, and issued a warning to the unionists Paulo Roberto Fier and Sergio Luiz Monteiro because they did not come in to work on time because of a demonstration that was held on  June , during which the enterprise had closed its points of entry.
.The Committee notes that the Government sent a detailed communication from the enterprise indicating in relation to the allegations that: () it did not refuse the union officials entry to the industrial estate, as is demonstrated by the log book recording the entry of union officials to the industrial estate, and the enterprise made a proposal to the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour to enter into an agreement on conduct in this regard, before it knew about the complaint; () it never acted in a discriminatory way with regard to the appraisal of trade union officials.

The enterprise had planned to carry out some general maintenance work in January  and had therefore called on workers from other plants and had put them up in hotels in the city of Araucaria. These workers were used to meet emergency service requirements and they were never shut in. The complainant organization knew that the maintenance work would be carried out but still called the strike.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, on  November , the enterprise and the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour signed a written undertaking in which the enterprise made a commitment among other things: () to handle all complaints using the existing institutional mechanisms (ethics committee and union representation together with the Board of Directors), take decisions regarding the prevention and/or elimination of harassment, and handle complaints discreetly, ensuring that the complainant and witnesses are not subjected to acts of repression as a result of the claim; () to ensure that information is made widely available within the enterprise, by putting notices on the walls, on the mechanisms that are in place to receive complaints of harassment; () to refrain from any discriminatory conduct that violates the right to equality, prohibiting the consideration of whether or not a worker is a member of a union or has links with a union as a factor in the evaluation or promotion of employees, or as a justification for dismissal; () to refrain from relocating/transferring employees, even within the same establishment, under the pretext of punishment or isolation; () to refrain from carrying out acts that constitute coercion or the curtailment of freedom of association, allowing union officials access to the enterprise at least once a week, by agreement with the union, and adhering to occupational safety rules; () to refrain from asking that a specific reason be provided for the union visits, taking into account that the union may simply be interested in contacting the workers without a prior specific reason; () to allow dialogue between the workers and union officials to take place without a representative of the enterprise being present, in communal areas on the premises but away from the areas in which the work is carried out, in order to avoid occupational safety hazards; () the signature of the agreement does not imply any acknowledgement with regard to the complaints that have been filed; () for breach of the obligations provided for in the undertaking, the enterprise must pay a fine of , Brazilian reais, duly adjusted; and () the undertaking is subject to inspection by the regional labour inspectorate and/or the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour.
.The Committee understands that the written undertaking has brought an end to the dispute. Finally, the Committee notes that no information has been supplied in relation to the allegation that union official Mr Paulo Roberto Fier was reported to the police as he was considered to be responsible for a demonstration outside the factory on  May  and for having threatened the workers who wanted to enter the factory. The Committee cannot determine whether the provisions of paragraph  of the written undertaking have led to the withdrawal of the complaint and requests the Government to inform it in that regard. Should the complaint not have been withdrawn, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed about the status of the complaint and about whether legal proceedings have been initiated.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee takes note of the agreement between the enterprise mentioned in paragraph  and the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour bringing an end to the dispute which gave rise to the present complaint.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of whether the complaint made to the police against union leader Mr Paulo Roberto Fier has been withdrawn under the written undertaking that the company, as mentioned in paragraph , signed with the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour and, if not, to keep it informed about the status of the complaint and about whether legal proceedings have been initiated.",-1,2008,Brazil

The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in November  and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th meeting in November , paras ' ]. At its meeting in June , the Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules established in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting even if the requested information and observations had not been received in full and in due time.

.At its meeting in November , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take without delay all measures within its power to ensure as a matter of priority the reinstatement without loss of wages of the trade union officials and workers dismissed from the Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo enterprise for having participated in the work stoppages of  April and ,  and  August , as well as the reinstatement of those trade union officials dismissed from the Opportrans SA enterprise on the eve of a collective bargaining process in April ; if the competent authorities determine that reinstatement is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, adequate compensation should be awarded to remedy all damages suffered and prevent any repetition of such acts in the future, so as to constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction against acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to carry out an investigation into the allegations regarding: () the recruitment of workers in the abovementioned company in the transportation sector in So Paulo enterprise to replace any workers participating in future strikes; and () the refusal by the abovementioned company in the transportation sector in Rio de Janeiro to recognize the members of the executive committee of the SIMERJ as trade union officials, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.In its communication of  June , the Government reports that it requested the Labour Relations Departments of the Regional Labour and Employment Authorities of the states of So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to call mediation meetings between the parties in relation to the Committee s recommendations and to keep it informed on the outcome of these meetings.
.The Committee recalls that when it examined this case, concerning the allegations of dismissal of union officials and members for participating in a strike as well as of other anti-union acts in the transport sector, at its meeting in November , it requested: () the Government to take without delay all measures within its power to ensure as a matter of priority the reinstatement without loss of wages of the trade union officials andworkers dismissed from the Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo enterprise for having participated in the work stoppages of  April and ,  and  August , as well as the reinstatement of those trade union officials dismissed from the Opportrans SA enterprise on the eve of a collective bargaining process in April ; if the competent authorities determine that reinstatement is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, adequate compensation should be awarded to remedy all damages suffered and prevent any repetition of such acts in the future, so as to constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction against acts of anti-union discrimination; () the Government to take all necessary measures to carry out an investigation into the allegations regarding: (a) the recruitment of workers in the abovementioned company in the transportation sector in So Paulo to replace any workers participating in future strikes; and (b) the refusal by the abovementioned company in the transportation sector in Rio de Janeiro to recognize the members of the executive committee of the Union of Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers of Rio de Janeiro (SIMERJ) as trade union officials, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government reports that it has requested the Labour Relations Departments of the Regional Labour and Employment Authorities of the states of So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to call mediation meetings between the parties in relation to the Committee s recommendations and to keep it informed on the outcome of these meetings. The Committee draws the Government s attention to the need to urgently find a solution and points out that the meetings referred to by the Government should not delay the implementation of recommendations made by the Committee at its previous examination of the case. Under these circumstances, bearing in mind that the last examination of the case was in November , the Committee firmly expects that the mediation proceedings mentioned by the Government cover all the pending allegations, are held without delay and allow satisfactory solutions to be found. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee firmly expects that the mediation proceedings between the National Federation of Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers (FENAMETRO) and the enterprises Compaa do Metropolitano de So Paulo and Opportrans SA of Ro de Janeiro convened by the Government cover all pending allegations, are held without delay and allow satisfactory solutions to be found. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(b) The Committee draws the Government s attention to the need to urgently find a solution and points out that the meetings referred to by the Government should not delay the implementation of recommendations made by the Committee at its previous examination of the case.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the National Federation of Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers (FENAMETRO) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May  the complainant organization states that Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo is a public enterprise which forms an integral part of the administrative structure of the Government of the State of So Paulo. The complainant organization alleges that, as the sole holder of its capital stock, the enterprise has unduly interfered in the free organization and trade union activities of the metro workers by carrying out dismissals in reprisal for strike action. Moreover, the complainant organization alleges that the Government of the State of So Paulo publicly admitted that it intended to recruit workers on a permanent basis with the sole and deliberate aim of replacing any workers participating in strike action carried out by the Union of So Paulo Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers (Sindicato dos Trabalhadores em Empresas de Transporte Metrovirios de So Paulo) in order to undermine such action. According to the complainant organization, the situation is all the more serious given that the federal bodies of the Federative Republic of Brazil, in particular the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Labour Public Prosecutor s Office and the labour courts, which are responsible for supervising compliance with labour legislation and the prevention of such practices throughout the country, have failed to effectively combat and suppress the clearly discriminatory practices of the Government of the State of So Paulo and the Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo enterprise, to the detriment of the free organization and trade union activities of So Paulo metro workers.
.The complainant organization states that on  April  the So Paulo metro workers launched a work stoppage in protest at the possibility of the executive branch vetoing  Amendment No. '  a draft bill under which federal inspectors would no longer have the authority to declare the existence of an employment relationship where an inspected enterprise is clearly found to be evading labour legislation. The complainant organization alleges that immediately following the work stoppage, on  April , Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo dismissed five officials of the Union of So Paulo Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers (Paulo Roberto Pasn, Pedro Augustinelli Filho, Ronaldo de Oliveira Campos, Alex Fernndes Alcazar and Ciro Moraes), claiming that the trade union officials had sabotaged the operation of trains in the enterprise, as well as disconnecting the electricity",-1,2008,Brazil
33,"in the vicinity of S?c metro station. The complainant organization states that it is clear from the above information that the trade union officials were dismissed as a result of the work stoppage and that the enterprise then proceeded to carry out the dismissals without taking the appropriate measures in regard to the accusations levelled at the workers. This demonstrates that the trade union officials were dismissed because of their participation in trade union activities. According to the complainant organization, the dismissals are all the more discriminatory in the light of the fact that the enterprise dismissed the workers without having conducted an investigation into the acts of vandalism of which the workers and trade union officials were accused.
.The complainant organization adds that, on ,  and  August , the So Paulo metro system workers held a work stoppage in protest at the policy of Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo concerning employee profit sharing. At the time the workers were demanding payment of a fixed amount, to be divided equally among the employees, as had been the practice in the enterprise for over ten years. According to the complainant organization, the enterprise submitted a proposal to alter this practice by establishing a system whereby employees would receive an amount in proportion to their wages. Once the work stoppage was over, in a clear act of reprisal, the Government of the State of So Paulo ordered Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo to dismiss  workers who had taken part in the stoppage.
.The complainant organization alleges that the group of workers dismissed includes an official of FENAMETRO, six officials of the Union of So Paulo Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers and another three candidates for office in the latter organization, which was scheduled to hold elections between  and  September . The complainant organization states that the Governor of the State of So Paulo himself not only publicly admitted the repressive and intimidatory nature of the dismissals, but also described the actions of the Union of So Paulo Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers as political and opportunistic. More specifically, he stated in the media that the dismissal of  employees of Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo was intended as a response from the Government and the metro itself to the working population of So Paulo and that the measures were aimed at preventing any future work stoppages either by the metro workers or by any other category of public servant or employee of the Government of the State of So Paulo.
.The complainant organization considers that although the competent judicial authority ruled that the work stoppage was abusive, this alone does not justify the dismissal of trade union officials and workers for having participated in it. The only effect of that legal decision should be for the workers to resume their normal duties; to do otherwise would be to authorize government intimidation and reprisals, in violation of Convention No. .
.FENAMETRO adds that in addition to the abovementioned violations of the principles of freedom of association, the Government of the State of So Paulo and Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo publicly announced that they planned to hire  workers on a permanent basis, with the sole aim of replacing any metro workers participating in future work stoppages. According to the Secretary for Metropolitan Transport of the Government of the State of So Paulo,  of the  workers to be hired on a permanent basis will be supervisors, making it extremely difficult for them to join a union because they will be in positions of authority. The recruitment of these replacement workers on a permanent basis was announced on the Universo OnLine news portal, as well as in the O Estado de So Paulo newspaper. According to the complainant organization, the aim of Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo is to have sufficient replacement workers to keep all of its train services running, thus rendering any strikes held by the workers ineffective. According to FENAMETRO, if the plan to hire replacement workers on a permanent basis goes ahead, it will undermine any trade union action undertaken by the workers of the So Paulo metro system in order to organize independently, and more specifically, to achieve a balance of power between workers and employers in determining working conditions. It is precisely for this reason that Brazilian legislation governing strike action only authorizes the hiring of replacement workers in exceptional cases, for the duration of the strike and not, as the Government of the State of So Paulo intends, on a permanent basis.
.FENAMETRO adds that in mid- the Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro granted the Opportrans SA enterprise permission to operate metro lines and stations in the city of Rio de Janeiro. That enterprise began operations one year later, on  April . Since then the Union of Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers of Rio de Janeiro (SIMERJ), an affiliate of FENAMETRO, has filed complaints with the competent authorities concerning various problems related to the precarious working and safety conditions experienced by the workers. Owing to the fact that the enterprise has failed to resolve the issues raised by SIMERJ, dialogue between the trade union and the enterprise has become difficult over the last few years.
.Relations between SIMERJ and the enterprise reached an all-time low on the eve of a collective bargaining process scheduled for April , when the enterprise dismissed two SIMERJ trade union officials, Joaz Paim Barbosa and Joao Fernndes Correa, in order to prevent them from participating in the negotiations concerning the agreement. The complainant organization adds that the enterprise also refused to recognize the members of the ordinary executive committee as trade union officials, and argued that under an earlier agreement the number of trade union officials was limited to seven.
.The complainant organization adds that at the time of their dismissals, the trade union officials in the Opportrans SA enterprise were officers, as well as candidates to serve on the bargaining committee, the members of which were to be elected during the general assembly of  April , that was to represent SIMERJ at the abovementioned meetings. The complainant organization considers that the trade union officials were dismissed in order to undermine and intimidate the SIMERJ delegation that planned to participate in the upcoming collective bargaining process. The Organization points out that in the wake of the election of trade union officials Barbosa and Correa, the management of Opportrans SA refused to initiate the bargaining process while the officials in question remained members of the SIMERJ delegation. The complainant organization stresses that the Government, as the body responsible for ensuring compliance with labour legislation, must take steps to ensure that the dismissed trade union officials are reinstated.
.The complainant organization states that in the sphere of the public administration, the competent bodies (the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the regional labour offices and the Secretariat of Transport of the State of Rio de Janeiro) have failed to inspect the enterprise and prohibit it from engaging in discriminatory practices. Regarding legislation, Brazilian law does not expressly recognize the concept of anti-union acts, and there is no protective mechanism in place to prevent discrimination against workers on account of their membership of a trade union. The legal protection conferred on the officials of bodies representing workers has proved to be insufficient to ensure freedom of association. The relevant legislation (article , paragraph VIII, of the Federal Constitution and sections () and  of the Consolidated Labour Laws) is currently interpreted by the courts in such a way as to limit job security to a specific number of trade union officials ( members maximum), regardless of the size and structure of the trade union organization.
.In the case of SIMERJ, this restrictive interpretation prevents the trade union organization from extending the right to job security to members of the financial board and shop stewards of SIMERJ who carry out their duties on the shop floor and are thus subject to interference and pressure on the part of the employer. Deprived of job security, the members of the financial board and shop stewards of SIMERJ are defenceless in the face of the discriminatory practices of the management of Opportrans SA. Consequently, their trade union activities are undermined, which in itself reflects an imbalance which constitutes a blatant violation of the principle of freedom of association. According to FENAMETRO, the Federative Republic of Brazil has clearly failed to implement measures to combat anti-union practices in the Rio de Janeiro metro system. The complainant organization states that it has presented this complaint so that the Government of Brazil will be made to take concrete steps to prohibit anti-union practices by the Government of the State of So Paulo, the Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo enterprise and the Opportrans SA enterprise.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that, together with the Ministry of Labour and Employment, it is committed to prohibiting anti-union practices and",-1,2008,Brazil
34,"to finding a legal solution to unjustified dismissals that occur in the labour market, as reflected in the allegations in this case. One example of the action already taken is the submission to the National Congress of a proposal for ratification of Convention No. . That Convention had previously been approved by the Congress of Brazil in September , but was subsequently denounced and has not been in force since December  as a result of a direct application for unconstitutionality lodged by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI). At the time it was argued that it would be extremely difficult to apply the Convention in the absence of any regulation of article , paragraph I, of the Federal Constitution, which provides for the protection of workers against arbitrary dismissal or dismissal without just cause. As a result of Constitutional Amendment No. , the trade unions requested that the ratification of the Convention be examined. This request was met by the Government in  and the matter was referred for discussion by the Tripartite Committee on International Relations (CTRI), a tripartite advisory body of the Ministry of Labour and Employment.
.In a meeting held on  October , the CTRI issued an opinion on the matter and, against opposition from employers, decided to recommend to the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, in accordance with the provisions of its internal regulations, that Convention No.  be sent to the National Congress for consideration. The Government points out that the decision to send the Convention to the National Congress for consideration is supported by the most representative trade union confederations and by the National Association of Labour Magistrates, which groups together labour judges from all over the country.
.The Government considers that ratification of the abovementioned Convention will make it possible to address one of the most important problems affecting Brazil s labour market today: high employee turnover, which is used as a means of reducing wage costs and labour s share in national income. This Convention is currently being examined by the Foreign Relations Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and the Government is doing everything possible to ensure its approval by Congress and ratification of this important instrument to combat unjustified dismissals such as those which occurred in this case in the State of So Paulo. The Government points out that the initiative concerning ratification of Convention No.  is part of a set of government measures aimed at democratizing labour relations so that the national legal system will include more comprehensive regulation of anti-union practices, which is currently lacking.
.With regard to the allegations of anti-union acts in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the Government finds it unacceptable that trade union officials, in the exercise of the office entrusted to them by their co-workers, should have suffered such a gross violation of their rights, which are guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil itself. In accordance with the provisions of Convention No. , the Constitution guarantees job security for all trade union officials and their substitutes who are elected by workers (article , paragraph VIII). The greatest difficulty faced by the Government in taking more decisive measures, such as reinstating workers in the enterprise, lies in the fact that, although freedom of association is guaranteed under the Constitution, and although the law provides protection from certain violations (as is the case of the Strike Act), there is no definition of anti-union conduct in the national legal system. This prevents the social partners and even the Ministry of Labour and Employment from taking effective preventive and repressive measures against conduct such as that which occurred in the city of Rio de Janeiro, referred to in the complaint.
.The Government points out that, in order to resolve this issue, together with workers and employers within the National Labour Forum (FNT), it has prepared a proposal for trade union reform which includes a definition of anti-union acts and penalties which may be imposed on offenders by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The draft Bill on trade union relations (No. /), currently in the final stages before the National Congress, contains a list of situations which constitute anti-union conduct. Any act intended to prevent or obstruct trade union activity by employers or workers shall be deemed to be an anti-union act and the offender may be liable to penalties. Under this proposal, the following shall constitute anti-union conduct: making recruitment or continued employment subject to membership, non-membership or termination of membership of a trade union organization; dismissing or discriminating against a worker on the grounds of his or her membership or activities in a trade union organization, participation in a strike or representation of workers in the workplace; granting less favourable financial treatment in a discriminatory manner on the grounds of trade union membership or activity; inciting workers to request their exclusion from proceedings initiated by a trade union organization in defence of their individual rights; forcing a worker to return to work, obstruct or hinder the exercise of the right to strike; hiring workers outside the purview of the law with the aim of replacing workers on strike; and violating the duty of good faith in collective bargaining. Under the provisions of the draft Bill, the perpetrators of anti-union acts may also be workers. The Government emphasizes that any sound proposal to resolve this issue must reflect the provisions of Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by Brazil. The proposal must also establish effective mechanisms for the imposition of penalties on offenders, which is meeting with considerable resistance from Brazil s employers. The Government indicates that the proposal put forward by the FNT fills the legislative gap by defining the anti-union acts which may be committed by workers and employers, while at the same time imposing penalties which ensure the effectiveness of the legislation. The Government explains that it was not possible to reach a consensus in the FNT on the issue of penalties, in particular with regard to the amount of the fine to be imposed for anti-union conduct. The employers' opposition to stipulating the amount of the fines has effectively contributed to delaying the passage of the draft Bill in the National Congress, but has in no way diminished the Government s expectation that the draft will be approved as soon as possible. It is a battle of wills, which is typical in a democratic society, in which the different interests of society have to be taken into account.
.Lastly, the Government denies that it fails to react to situations such as those described in this case. The Regional Labour and Employment Authority (formerly the Regional Labour Office) played an appropriate and important role in handling the case referred to in the City of Rio de Janeiro. The Labour Inspectorate recently recruited over  new officials, which demonstrate that the prevention of anti-union practices such as those alleged in this case is a constant concern. The Government is committed to taking measures on several fronts: on the one hand through amendments to legislation in order to put in place an appropriate national legal framework and, on the other, through labour inspection, which is first and foremost in the workers' own interest.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges that the Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo enterprise dismissed five trade union officials (referred to by name in the allegations) belonging to the Union of So Paulo Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers on  April  and  workers (including a FENAMETRO official and six officials of the abovementioned trade union) in August  for having participated in work stoppages and that the enterprise announced the recruitment of  workers to replace any workers participating in future strikes; furthermore, the complainant organization alleges that the Opportrans SA enterprise, which operates the metro lines and stations in the City of Rio de Janeiro, dismissed two officials (referred to by name) of the Union of Metro System Transport Enterprise Workers of Rio de Janeiro (SIMERJ) on the eve of a collective bargaining process scheduled for April , with the aim of undermining and intimidating the SIMERJ delegation that was to participate in the upcoming collective bargaining process, and that the enterprise refuses to recognize the members of the executive committee as trade union officials.
.The Committee notes that the Government reiterates its previous replies in Cases Nos  and , recently examined by the Committee [see rd Report, paras ' ], to the effect that: () it is committed to finding a legal solution to the unjustified dismissals that occur in the labour market, as reflected in the allegations in this case. An example of this commitment is the submission to the National Congress of a proposal for ratification of Convention No. ; () the initiative concerning ratification of that Convention is part of a set of measures aimed at democratizing labour relations so that the laws of Brazil will include more comprehensive regulation of anti-union practices, which is",-1,2008,Brazil
35,"currently lacking in the legislation; () although freedom of association is protected under the Constitution, the national legislation does not define anti-union acts, and this prevents the Ministry of Labour and Employment from taking effective preventive and repressive measures against conduct such as that reported in this case; () in order to resolve this issue the Government, together with workers and employers within the National Labour Forum (FNT), has prepared a proposal for trade union reform (No. /, currently in the final stages before the National Congress) which contains a more complete definition of anti-union acts and provides for penalties which may be imposed on offenders by the Ministry of Labour and Employment; () the draft Bill on trade union relations currently before the National Congress contains a list of situations which constitute anti-union conduct (making recruitment or continued employment subject to membership, non-membership or termination of membership of a trade union organization, dismissing or discriminating against a worker on the grounds of his or her membership or activities in a trade union organization, participation in a strike or representation in the workplace, etc.); () any sound proposal to resolve this issue must reflect the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  and establish effective mechanisms for the imposition of penalties on offenders, a point which raises differences of opinion between employers and workers as to the amount of the fines to be imposed for anti-union conduct; () the proposal put forward by the FNT fills the legislative gap by defining the anti-union acts which may be committed by employers and workers, while at the same time imposing penalties which ensure the effectiveness of the legislation; and () it was not possible to achieve a consensus in the FNT on the issue of penalties, in particular with regard to the amount of the fine to be imposed for anti-union conduct, but while this has delayed the passage of the draft Bill in the National Congress, it has in no way diminished the Government s expectation that the draft will be approved as soon as possible.
.In these circumstances, noting that the Government acknowledges the allegations and considers the events occurring in Rio de Janeiro to be a gross violation of the trade union rights guaranteed by the Constitution, describes the dismissals carried out in So Paulo as unjustified and adds that the absence of a complete definition of anti-union acts prevents the social partners and even the Ministry of Labour and Employment from taking effective preventive and repressive measures, the Committee requests the Government to take without delay all measures within its power to ensure as a matter of priority the reinstatement without loss of wages of the trade union officials and workers dismissed at the abovementioned company in the transportation sector of So Paulo enterprise for having participated in the work stoppages of  April and ,  and  August , as well as the reinstatement of those trade union officials dismissed from the abovementioned company in the transportation sector in Rio de Janiero on the eve of a collective bargaining process in April ; if the competent authorities determine that reinstatement of the trade union officials is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, adequate compensation should be awarded to remedy all damages suffered and prevent any repetition of such acts in the future, so as to constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction against acts of anti-union discrimination. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this respect.
.Furthermore, the Committee requests the Government to take all necessary measures to carry out an investigation into the allegations regarding: () the recruitment of workers in the abovementioned company in the transportation sector in So Paulo to replace any workers participating in future strikes; and () the refusal by the abovementioned company in the transportation sector in Rio de Janeiro to recognize the members of the executive committee of SIMERJ as trade union officials, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.Lastly, while welcoming the steps taken to adopt a draft Bill for trade union reform that includes a more complete definition of anti-union acts and provides for penalties for offenders which may be imposed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case in regard to the application of Convention No. .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take without delay all measures within its power to ensure as a matter of priority the reinstatement without loss of wages of the trade union officials and workers dismissed from the Compaia do Metropolitano de So Paulo enterprise for having participated in the work stoppages of  April and ,  and  August , as well as the reinstatement of those trade union officials dismissed from the Opportrans SA enterprise on the eve of a collective bargaining process in April ; if the competent authorities determine that reinstatement is not possible for objective and compelling reasons, adequate compensation should be awarded to remedy all damages suffered and prevent any repetition of such acts in the future, so as to constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction against acts of anti-union discrimination.

36,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the Union of Workers in Metal, Engineering and Electrical Equipment Industries of Caxias do Sul and the Central Organization of Workers of Brazil (CTB) dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  March , the Union of Workers in Metal, Engineering and Electrical Equipment Industries of Caxias do Sul and the CTB allege that, in violation of the principles of freedom of association, the management of the enterprise FRASLE SA dismissed trade union official Jorge Antonio Rodrguez on  January . The complainant organizations provide the following details about the career of Mr Rodrguez as a trade union official: in , he was elected as vice-chairperson; in , he was elected as chairperson; in  and , he was re-elected as chairperson; in , he was elected as director of legal and labour relations matters and in , he was elected as chairperson of the union s financial board.
.According to the complainant organizations, during the whole time that Mr Rodrguez worked at the enterprise, he never committed an illegal act or breached a legal or contractual obligation that would justify the unilateral decision to terminate his contract. Even if he had committed serious misconduct, the enterprise should have suspended the worker and called on the judicial authority to conduct an investigation to prove that an illegal act had been committed. No such investigation took place, because the trade union official did not commit any serious misconduct and the enterprise simply dismissed him without just cause.
.According to the complainant organizations, the dismissal was a penalty for the official s trade union activity and for his firm stand in defence of workers' rights (during his last term of office, he had been called upon to intervene on several occasions to defend the rights of the entire occupational category that he represented).
.The complainant organizations report that, in a show of solidarity and gratitude for Jorge Antonio Rodrguez, the workers of the enterprise staged a work stoppage on  January . The complainant organizations consider that the dismissal without just cause of the official in question is an act of discrimination that violates freedom of association and undermines the right of workers to trade union representation in the workplace.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that it is unbelievable and unacceptable that a trade union official in the exercise of the office entrusted to him by his fellow workers ' which expired on  December  ' should have been the victim of a gross violation of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil. In fact, in accordance with the provisions of Convention No. , the Constitution guarantees job security for all trade union officials and their substitutes who are elected by workers (section , paragraph VIII). The trade union official in question was elected to serve as the chairperson of the supervisory board of the union, and as such he enjoyed the guarantee of job security provided under section  of the Constitution.
.In terms of taking a decisive measure, such as reinstating the worker in the enterprise, the greatest difficulty that the Government faces lies in the fact that, although freedom of association is guaranteed under the Constitution and although the law provides protection from certain violations (as is the case with the Strike Act), anti-union behaviour is not fully recognized as an offence by the national legal system. This prevents the social partners and even the Ministry of Labour and Employment from taking effective preventive and repressive measures to regulate the type of conduct mentioned in the complaint.
.According to the Government, in an attempt to resolve this issue, it prepared, in the context of the National Labour Forum and together with workers and employers, a proposal for trade union reform which includes a more complete definition of anti-union acts and provides for penalties for offenders, which may be imposed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The preliminary draft act on trade union relations (No. /), which is pending the final stages of approval by the National Congress, provides for a number of situations that constitute anti-union behaviour. Any act by employers or workers that is intended to impede or obstruct trade union activities shall be considered as anti-union behaviour and penalties may be imposed on the offender. The Government also sent to the National Congress a proposal on the ratification of Convention No. .
.In any case, in view of the Government s limited capacity to act in response to situations that clearly flout legislation, as is demonstrated in the present case, the priority of the Government is precisely to formulate legislative proposals which not only extend the rights of workers, but which can also guarantee the effective implementation of those rights. Lastly, the Government indicates that, in the current situation, as described, the worker should seek legal redress so that a decision may be taken by the labour courts to ensure respect for all his rights, which would lead to the reinstatement of the worker in his post. The labour courts of Brazil are playing an increasingly active role in combating this type of behaviour and accordingly the majority of their decisions are consistent with the best interests of workers.
.For the purposes of these conclusions and recommendations, a reference to  the company' is a reference to the enterprise FRASLE SA.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant organizations allege that Jorge Antonio Rodrguez, a long-serving official, was dismissed from the company on  January  on anti-union grounds. According to the complainant organizations, the dismissal was a penalty for the official s trade union activity and for his firm stand in defence of workers' rights.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government: () it is unbelievable and unacceptable that a trade union official in the exercise of the office entrusted to him by workers ' which expired on  December  ' should have been the victim of a gross violation of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil; () in accordance with the provisions of Convention No. , the Constitution guarantees job security for all trade union officials and their substitutes elected by workers (section , paragraph VIII); as the trade union official in question was elected to serve as the chairperson of the union s financial board, he accordingly enjoyed the guarantee of job security provided under the Constitution; () in terms of taking a decisive measure, such as reinstating the worker in the enterprise, the greatest difficulty that the Government faces lies in the fact that, although freedom of association is guaranteed under the Constitution, anti-union behaviour is not fully recognized as an offence by the national legal system and this prevents the Ministry of Labour and Employment from taking effective preventive and repressive measures to regulate the type of conduct mentioned in the complaint; () in an attempt to resolve this issue, the Government, together with workers and employers, prepared in the context of the National Labour Forum a proposal for trade union reform (No. /, which is pending the final stages of approval by the National Congress) which includes a more complete definition of anti-union acts and provides for penalties for offenders, which may be imposed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment; () in view of the Government s limited capacity to act in response to situations that clearly flout legislation, as is demonstrated in the present case, the priority of the Government is precisely to formulate legislative proposals which not only extend the rights of workers but also guarantee the effective implementation of these rights; and () in the current situation, as described, the worker should seek legal redress so that a decision may be taken by the labour courts to ensure respect for all his rights, which would lead to the reinstatement of the worker in his post.
.In these circumstances, noting that the Government acknowledges the allegations, and considers them to be a gross violation of the trade union rights guaranteed by the Constitution and a flouting of the legislation, and further noting the Government s indication that anti-union behaviour is not fully recognized in the national legal system and prevents the social partners and the Ministry of Labour and Employment from taking effective preventive and repressive measures, the Committee requests the Government to take without delay all measures within its power to ensure the reinstatement of Jorge Antonio Rodrguez in the company. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to indicate whether Jorge Antonio Rodrguez has initiated legal proceedings in connection with his dismissal.
.Lastly, welcoming the steps taken to adopt a law (proposal for trade union reform) that",-1,2008,Brazil
37,"includes a more complete definition of anti-union acts and provides for penalties for offenders, which may be imposed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case relating to the application of Convention No. .
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take without delay all measures within its power to ensure the reinstatement of trade union official Jorge Antonio Rodrguez in the company. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to indicate whether Jorge Antonio Rodrguez has initiated legal proceedings in connection with his dismissal.(b) Welcoming the steps taken to adopt a law (proposal for trade union reform) that includes a more complete definition of anti-union acts and provides for penalties for offenders, which may be imposed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the legislative aspects of this case relating to the application of Convention No. .",-1,2008,Brazil
38,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Union of Workers in the Urban Industries of the State of Par (STIUPA) dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  March , the Union of Workers in the Urban Industries of the State of Par (STIUPA) alleges that, between January and April , the company Centrales Elctricas de Par SA dismissed  workers in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner ( were subsequently reinstated following a public civil action with an application for a provisional protection order). The complainant organization adds that, in addition to the  workers dismissed, four trade union leaders were dismissed and it alleges that they were not covered by the security provided for under section  of the consolidated labour laws. The dismissals of the trade union leaders were reported to the Labour and Employment Prosecution Service and their reinstatement was achieved following a public civil action.
.From August , the trade union and the company initiated negotiations through which an agreement was reached which put an end to a dispute which had been developing over more than two years. It was agreed that the dismissed workers who were not reinstated would be paid  months' basic wages and those who were reinstated would be paid four months' wages. The agreement was concluded and officially approved on  October .
.The STIUPA alleges that on  December , the company dismissed  of the  workers who had been reinstated, without complying with the above agreement and falsely stating that the trade union organization had agreed to the dismissals. Of the  dismissed workers, only four were not unionized. The complainant organization reports that in the face of the company s anti-union attitude a public civil action was lodged and the reinstatement of the dismissed workers was achieved on  December . The STIUPA reports that the judicial authority recognized the discriminatory and abusive nature of the dismissals and ordered the company to refrain from such practices under penalty of a fine. According to the STIUPA, the company s anti-union attitude is not new, given that, in , a group of managers formed a movement to weaken the trade union. It also reports that, through the Ministry of Labour, three agreements were concluded to modify the company s conduct with a view to improving the industrial relations between the company and the trade union. Under the first agreement the company was obliged to refrain from adopting any kind of negative attitude towards the unionization of workers and the free movement of trade union leaders on the company s premises and to maintain harmonious relations with the trade union.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Employment is determined to find a legal solution to the wrongful dismissals which occur in the labour market and which are reflected in the alleged events in this case. An example of this determination is the submission to the National Congress of a proposal for the ratification of Convention No. . This Convention was already previously approved by the Congress of Brazil in September , but it was subsequently denounced and has not been in force as of December . As a result of Constitutional Amendment No. , the trade union organizations requested that the ratification of the Convention concerned be examined. This request was met by the Government in  and the matter was submitted for discussion by the Tripartite Committee on International Relations (CTRI), a tripartite advisory body of the Ministry of Labour and Employment.
.In a meeting held on  October , the CTRI issued an opinion on the matter and, with the opposition of the employer s sector, it decided to recommend to the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, in accordance with the provisions of its internal regulations that Convention No.  should be sent to the National Congress for consideration. The Government points out that the decision to send the Convention to the National Congress for consideration is supported by the most representative trade union confederations and by the National Association of Labour Magistrates, a body which gathers together labour judges from across the country.
.The Government considers that ratification of Convention No.  will allow one of the most significant problems in Brazil s labour market today to be tackled: the high turnover of employees, which is a tool used to reduce wages costs. This Convention is currently being examined by the Foreign Relations Committee of the Chamber of Deputies and the Government is taking all possible steps to ensure that the Congress approves it and is able to ratify this major instrument designed to combat wrongful dismissals, as occurred in the case presented to the Committee.
.The Government points out that the initiative relating to the ratification of Convention No.  is part of a set of Government actions designed to make its labour relations more democratic and ensure that the legislation provides for more comprehensive regulation of anti-union practices, which is currently lacking. The Government emphasizes that although freedom of association is protected under the Constitution and the legislation offers protection of constitutional rights in the case of certain abuses (for example under the Strike Act), the national legislation does not provide a precise definition of anti-union acts. This prevents the social partners and the Ministry of Labour and Employment from applying effective preventive and repressive measures to control practices such as those reported in this case.
.The Government points out that, in an attempt to resolve this issue, it has prepared, in collaboration with workers and employers within the National Labour Forum, a proposal for trade union reform which includes a more precise definition of anti-union acts and provides for sanctions which may be imposed on offenders by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The draft Bill on trade union relations (No. /), which is currently in the final stages before the National Congress, provides for a number of situations which constitute anti-union conduct. Any act which is intended to prevent or obstruct trade union activity by employers or workers shall be regarded as an anti-union act and the offender may be liable to sanctions.
.Under this proposal, the following shall constitute anti-union conduct: making recruitment or continued employment subject to membership, non-membership or termination of membership of a trade union organization; dismissing or discriminating against a worker on the grounds of his or her membership or activities in a trade union organization, participation in a strike or representation of workers in the workplace; granting more favourable financial treatment in a discriminatory manner on the grounds of trade union membership or activity; inciting workers to request their exclusion from proceedings initiated by a trade union organization in defence of their individual rights; forcing a worker to return to work to obstruct or hinder the exercise of the right to strike; hiring workers outside the purview of the law with the aim of replacing workers on strike; and violating the duty of good faith in collective bargaining. Under the provisions of the draft Bill, workers may also commit anti-union acts. The Government emphasizes that a good proposal to resolve this issue inevitably has to reflect the provisions of Convention Nos  and , which have been ratified by Brazil. The proposal must also establish effective mechanisms for the imposition of sanctions on offenders, which is being met with considerable resistance from Brazil s employer s sector. The Government indicates that the proposal originating from the National Labour Forum fills the legislative void by providing a more precise definition of anti-union acts which may be committed by workers and employers and at the same time imposing sanctions and penalties which ensure the effectiveness of the legislation. The Government explains that it was not possible to reach a consensus in the National Labour Forum on the issue of sanctions and penalties, in particular with regard to the amount of the fine to be imposed in the case of anti-union conduct. The employers' opposition with regard to the stipulated amount of the fines has had an effect on the length of time taken to pass the draft through the National Congress, but has in no way diminished the Government s expectation that the draft will be approved as soon as possible. It is a trial of strength, which is typical in a democratic society, in which the different interests of society have to be taken into account.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organization alleges that on several occasions, between  and , the company Centrales Elctricas de Par SA dismissed a number of trade union leaders and  workers in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner (the trade union",-1,2008,Brazil
39,"leaders and a large number of workers were subsequently reinstated following legal action; the judicial authority recognized the discriminatory and abusive nature of the dismissals and ordered the company to refrain from such practices under penalty of a fine) and that the company has been adopting an anti-union attitude since .
.The Committee notes that the Government reports that: () it is determined to find a legal solution to the wrongful dismissals which occur in the labour market and which are reflected in the alleged events in this case, and that, as an example of its determination, it has submitted to the National Congress a proposal for the ratification of Convention No. ; () the initiative concerning the ratification of that Convention forms part of a set of actions aimed at making labour relations more democratic and ensuring that the laws of Brazil provide for more comprehensive regulation of anti-union practices, currently lacking in the legislation; () although freedom of association is protected under the Constitution, the national legislation does not define anti-union acts and this prevents the Ministry of Labour and Employment from applying effective preventive and repressive measures to control acts such as those reported in this case; () in an attempt to resolve this issue, the Government, together with workers and employers within the National Labour Forum, has prepared a proposal for trade union reform (No. /, which is currently in the final stages before the National Congress) which gives a more complete definition of anti-union acts and provides for sanctions which may be imposed on offenders by the Ministry of Labour and Employment; () the draft Bill on trade union relations, currently before the National Congress, provides for a number of situations which constitute anti-union practice (making recruitment or continued employment subject to membership or non-membership of a trade union organization, dismissing or discriminating against a worker on the grounds of his or her membership or activities in a trade union organization, participation in a strike or representation in the workplace, etc.); () a good proposal to resolve this issue inevitably has to reflect the provisions of Conventions Nos  and  and must establish effective mechanisms for the imposition of sanctions on offenders, which has been met with a difference of opinion as to the level of sanctions to be imposed in the case of anti-union behaviour between employers and workers; () the National Labour Forum s proposal fills the legislative gap by providing a more complete definition of anti-union acts which may be committed by employers and workers and at the same time imposing sanctions and penalties which ensure the effectiveness of the legislation; and () it was not possible to achieve a consensus in the National Labour Forum on the issue of sanctions and penalties, in particular with regard to the amount of the fine to be imposed in the case of anti-union conduct, but while this has had an effect on the length of time taken to pass the draft through the National Congress, it has in no way diminished the Government s expectation that the draft will be approved as soon as possible.
.The Committee observes that the Government acknowledges the anti-union dismissals alleged and that these dismissals were resolved through an agreement between the parties or by a court ruling. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to continue to ensure respect for trade union rights in the company in question.
.In general, the Committee notes that the Government points out that the lack of definition of anti-union acts in the legislation prevents the Ministry of Labour and Employment from applying effective preventive and repressive measures to control acts such as those reported in this case. In this respect, the Committee notes with interest that initiatives have been taken relating to the adoption of legislation (a proposal for trade union reform) which includes a more precise definition of anti-union acts and provides for sanctions which may be imposed on offenders by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. In this regard, the Committee draws the legislative aspects of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations for it to examine with regard to the application of Convention No. .

40,".The complaint under this case is contained in a communication from the National Confederation of Metalworkers (CNM) dated  May .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the CNM, on behalf of the Trade Union of Workers in the Metallurgical, Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Industries of Porto Alegre (STIMMMEPA), indicates that General Motors of Brazil, a company with multinational capital established in the city of Gravata, Ro Grande do Sul since , has been carrying out its activities without respecting the rights of its workers. There have been violations of the basic rights of the workers contained in the labour legislation, as well as abuses of their dignity in their work. The CNM adds that the principles contained in the International Labour Organization Conventions have also been violated. The complainant organization indicates that it is not appropriate in this complaint to discuss which trade union is the most representative for the category of metalworkers in Gravata, given that this issue should be resolved by the judiciary or trade unions.
.The establishment of General Motors of Brazil in the city of Gravata involved the implementation of projects intended to split the trade union representation of the metalworkers in that city. The splits produced in the category constituted a strategic objective when establishing the company in the city. This brought about an alliance between employer sectors and a trade unionism that existed  on paper' and was docile and lacking in commitment. These docile trade unions that were submissive to the employers did not play the necessary and responsible role of defending the rights of workers. In this context, an artificial split of the metallurgical base of the workers in the city of Gravata was created, which was achieved through the creation of the Trade Union for Workers in the Metallurgical, Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Industries of Gravata (SINMGRA). The meeting creating this trade union was riddled with flaws. It was held with no more than  people, some of whom did not belong to the metallurgical sector, and was carried out behind closed doors. Hundreds of workers from the sector who turned up to participate in the meeting to vote against the split and who wanted to continue being represented by the STIMMMEPA were prevented from entering the meeting. The complainant organization indicates that the SINMGRA trade union later merged with Ex-Association, another entity with low representation. The complainant organization states that, by means of a merely formal analysis and without evaluating the actual wishes of the workers concerned, these trade unions obtained a legal ruling awarding them representation for the sector. This ruling has been appealed before the judicial authority by means of various proceedings which are pending. According to the complainant organization it is important to point out that there are clear signs that these two trade unions and the trade union which resulted from their merger have received and are receiving material and political support from companies in the town concerned, and in particular from General Motors. This support ranges in practice from financial subsidies for the trade unions to explicit acts of coercion, violating the freedom of association, of the workers both individually and collectively, forcing them to join or support the company s preferred trade union under threat of being dismissed or punished.
.The complainant organization alleges that there is evidence that General Motors is subsidizing the SINMGRA, which is illegal, in that it shows employer intervention in the workers' trade union (the complainant organization refers to various faxes sent between staff of General Motors referring to the support that should be provided to the new trade union). According to the CNM, the company also pays additional sums of money to the leaders of the SINMGRA. The complainant organization alleges that the company favoured the trade union concerned not only through the payment of money or by exerting influence, but also through the recruitment of the leaders of the SINMGRA in order to integrate them into the management of the company, the purpose of which was to ensure that the company s interests could be defended more easily.
.The complainant organization indicates that, in addition to the financial benefits granted to the new trade union, the company denied access, in a discriminatory manner, to its premises by the STIMMMEPA. At the meetings held at the company the workers were urged to join or support the new trade union, under threat of serious consequences if they refused to comply. The workers, after observing the representativeness of the new trade union, rejected it in every possible way, which led to the persecution of these workers by the company. The persecution took the form of moral harassment or unjustified dismissals, in response to which a number of complaints were made about the company s attitudes. In September , the first complaints were lodged with the Public Prosecutor for Labour No. , requesting that investigations be conducted into the financial influence of General Motors in the creation of the SINMGRA. The complaints also referred to coercion and moral harassment by the employer with respect to workers who had rejected the new trade union representation and who had condemned the elections of that trade union, which were in their view null and void.
.As an example, the complainant organization mentions that, in , two employees of General Motors lodged another complaint with the Public Prosecutor for Labour, indicating that on  February  a meeting was held in the company s industrial complex for the purpose of approving the clauses of the collective agreement proposed by the SINMGRA, which had not been agreed upon at previous meetings with the workers. It adds that, when the workers arrived at the company, they were prevented from entering and were forced to remain in the car park, which was where the meeting took place, without the option of being present or participating in the meeting. The access gates to the car park were later closed, forcing the workers to be present at the meeting, with the sole objective of ensuring a quorum. The workers were also filmed or photographed in order to record any rejection by the workers at the meeting being held. In this way, the workers' right to participate freely or not to participate in the event was violated and they were forced to participate in the meeting held by mutual agreement between the SINMGRA and General Motors. Other complaints were lodged with the authorities by several tens of workers concerning acts of harassment and reprisal by the company.
.The complainant organization alleges that in the context of the violations of the ILO Conventions concerning freedom of association, workers Airton, Taborda and Rogelio Testa were recently dismissed based on a highly questionable just cause. The reason for their dismissal is clear: these workers were carrying out their activities independently, including activities aimed at ensuring greater protection of the work environment, and were questioning the legitimacy of the trade union financed by the enterprise.
.In its communication sent in November , the Government of Brazil states that on  December  it granted trade union registration to the STIMMMEPA to represent the category of workers in the metallurgical, mechanical and electrical equipment industries in the town of Porto Alegre. In  that trade union was granted an extension of its territorial base to the towns of Alborada, Cachoeirinha, Gravata, Guaiva and Viamao of the state of Ro Grande do Sul. On  September , the SINMGRA requested trade union registration and indicated that it was intending to represent the category of metalworkers in mechanical offices for the repair of vehicles and accessories, in the electrical equipment, electronics and electromechanical industry, in the automobile and part and component fitting and manufacturing industry, in the dental, medical and hospital products and equipment industry, in the refrigeration and water treatment industries and in the iron preparation industry in the municipality of Gravata. On  December  the SINMGRA (Ex-Association) requested trade union registration in order to represent the category of workers in the metallurgical, mechanical and electrical equipment industries in the municipality of Gravata, and it was in these circumstances that discussion started with regard to the representation of the metalworkers in the municipality of Gravata.
.The Government states that the request for trade union registration made by SINMGRA was challenged twice; one of the challenges was considered to be legitimate and the other not legitimate. The request for trade union registration made by SINMGRA therefore remained pending until the secretary for labour relations was notified of the relevant decision. On  September , based on the ruling of the Court of Justice of the State of Ro Grande do Sul, the registration of the SINMGRA was then published in the Official Journal of the Union. The STIMMMEPA, in disagreement with",-1,2007,Brazil
41,"the granting of trade union registration to SINMGRA, later lodged an appeal before Chamber  of the Judicial Department of the Federal District against the decision of the Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. In February  the Ministry was notified that the decision had been taken to suspend the administrative act granting trade union registration to the SINMGRA, re-establishing the representation of the professional category concerned in favour of the STIMMMEPA, until the controversy had been resolved by the state judicial authority. On  March  a ruling was handed down cancelling the trade union registration awarded to the SINMGRA. The SINMGRA then lodged an appeal against that ruling. The Government later refers to various legal proceedings instituted by the sector s trade unions. Finally, the Government states that, taking into account the ruling handed down by Chamber No.  of the Judicial Department of the Federal District, Technical Note DIAN/CGRS/SRT/MTE No. / was issued proposing the granting of definitive registration to the SINMGRA (Ex-Association) to represent the category of workers in the metallurgical, mechanical and electrical equipment industries based in the municipality of Gravata.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges that the establishment of the company General Motors in the city of Gravata involved the splitting of the trade union representation of the workers in the metallurgical sector, and that the company has favoured the creation of trade unions (SINMGRA and Ex-Association). The complainant organization alleges that, in addition, these trade unions are receiving political and financial support (supplementary payments to their leaders, recruitment of leaders in order to integrate them into the company s management) from the company, and that the company is threatening and coercing workers into supporting or joining those trade unions (it is alleged that there have been dismissals as a result of questioning the legitimacy of the trade unions financed by the company or for not supporting the activities of these trade unions, as well as pressure exerted on the workers to participate in their meetings). According to the complainant organization complaints have been lodged with the Public Prosecutor for Labour in connection with these events.
.The Committee notes that the Government refers in its reply to numerous administrative and judicial proceedings initiated by the trade unions of the metallurgical sector with the aim of obtaining representation of the workers based in the municipality of Gravata (which was ultimately granted to the SINMGRA ' Ex-Association).
.In this regard, the Committee observes that the Government does not refer in its reply to the allegations made concerning the acts of favouritism by General Motors towards two trade unions and against the STIMMMEPA. In these conditions, in order to reach its conclusions on the alleged facts in this case, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures, including consulting with the representative employers' organization, to have an investigation carried out into all the allegations made by the complainant organization and to communicate the findings of that investigation.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures, including consulting with the representative employers' organization, to have an investigation carried out into all the allegations made by the complainant organization (alleged acts of favouritism by General Motors towards two trade unions (SINMGRA and Ex-Association), dismissals and harassment of workers for not supporting or joining those unions, etc.) and to communicate the findings of that investigation.",-1,2007,Brazil

.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government: (i) to take the necessary steps to amend the legislation so as to allow workers to form trade union organizations at the enterprise level, if they so wish; and (ii) having regard to the national context and the specific circumstances of this case, to take steps to have the two officials of SINDFAVIP reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) With regard to the allegations concerning the dismissal, on  December , of all the teachers who had participated in the creation of the ADUCB-Seccin Sindical and the dismissal, in , of all the executive members of the SINDUNICALDAS, the Committee requests the Government to take measures without delay to hold an investigation to determine the motives and specific facts behind the dismissal of the officials in question and, if it is established that they were dismissed for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, that it take steps, having regard to the national context and the specific circumstances of this case, to have them reinstated in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) With regard to the allegations concerning the dismissal of ten members of the executive committee of the SINDUNIT ' a branch of ANDES-SINDICATO NACIONAL ' and the seven members of the Council of Representatives of the Trade Union Branch of Teachers at the UNIMEP, the Committee requests the Government to take measures without delay to hold an investigation to determine the motives and specific facts behind the dismissal of these officials and, if it is established that they were dismissed for carrying out legitimate trade union activities, that it take steps, having regard to the national context and the specific circumstances of this case, to have them reinstated in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d) With regard to the allegation that national legislation does not recognize the offence of anti-union acts against union members, and that there is therefore no protection mechanism to avoid discrimination against workers on the grounds of their membership of an organization, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation so as to bring it into conformity with freedom of association principles and to keep it informed of developments in the legal passage of the proposal for trade union reform to which the Government refers and which covers this issue. Moreover, the Committee reminds the Government that it may avail itself of the technical assistance of the Office, if it so wishes.(e) With regard to the allegation concerning the limited scope of the benefits of legal protection ' through job security ' afforded to officials of workers' representative organizations, the Committee, bearing in mind that the complainant is a national organization, requests the Government to bring the parties together to hold further discussions on this matter.",-1,2006,Brazil
43,".The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in March , and on that occasion asked the Government to send information with respect to the refusal to recognize the National Trade Union Committee of Unilever Brazil and the establishment of a parallel body of workers' representatives, as well as with respect to the new allegations that: () trade union official Mr Jos Santana de Lima has been subjected to harassment and received a verbal warning for absenting himself from the workplace in order to participate in a trade union activity; () the company is restricting and obstructing the taking of trade union leave by union officials; and () it is failing to comply with the collective agreement by not providing the union with documentation on industrial accidents [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In its communication of August , the Government sent a report from the enterprise Unilever in which the enterprise indicates, with regard to the alleged failure to recognize the National Trade Union Committee of Unilever Brazil, that legislation provides for a trade union structure comprised of confederations, federations and trade unions and does not provide for the existence of employees' committees in factories or enterprises. It also indicates that it has  factories and dozens of distribution centres and it maintains relations with  different trade unions. The enterprise also indicates that it has , employees throughout Brazil and that the Unified Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers (Vinhedo Region) represents only  per cent of the workers. Furthermore, the enterprise indicates that, taking into account its Code of Business Principles, it has established a dialogue and channels of communication with all legitimate workers' representatives. With regard to the new allegations that have been presented, the enterprise indicates that: () with regard to trade union official Mr Jos Santana de Lima, he was dismissed on grounds of poor performance; the judicial authority considered that he did not have trade union immunity and the union suspended him from his duties until the end of his mandate; () with regard to the taking of trade union leave, there are  union officials in the enterprise and  per cent of them are afforded paid leave and those who are not benefiting from paid leave may take leave of absence from work to participate in trade union activities; and () with regard to the failure to comply with the collective agreement by not providing the union with documentation on industrial accidents, a workplace accident report is prepared for  per cent of the accidents that take place in the enterprise and the procedures to ensure that the trade unions have such reports are improving. In , the enterprise invested . million Brazilian reals in the area of occupational health and safety and the accident rate is ten accidents per year for , workers.
.The Committee notes with interest this latest information.
.The Committee examined this case concerning allegations of anti-union discrimination and the establishment of a body of workers' representatives parallel to the Unified Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers (Vinhedo Region) at the instigation of the company, and non-recognition of the National Trade Union Committee. At the last examination of the case at its March  meeting, the Committee noted with interest the remedial measures ordered by the court against practices of anti-union discrimination and asked the Government to ensure that the principles of freedom of association are respected at the company Unilever. Furthermore, while noting the agreement concluded between the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour and the enterprise group, it asked the Government to provide information on the consideration given to the refusal to recognize the National Trade Union Committee and the alleged establishment of a body of parallel workers' representatives in the context of the judicial investigations and rulings [see rd Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication dated  March , the Single Central Organization of Workers of Brazil (CUT) and the Unified Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers (Vinhedo Region) allege that the company IGL Industrial Ltd of the enterprise group is not complying with the abovementioned judicial agreement and has engaged in new anti-union practices. Specifically, the complainant organizations allege that: () trade union official Mr Jos Santana de Lima has been subjected to harassment and received a verbal warning for absenting himself from the workplace in order to participate in a trade union activity; () the company is restricting and obstructing the taking of trade union leave by union officials; () it is failing to comply with the collective agreement by not providing the union with documentation on industrial accidents; and () the company continues to fail to recognize the National Trade Union Committee of Unilever Brazil.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government again sends a copy of the judicial agreement of October  between the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Labour and the enterprise group.
.The Committee urges the Government to send detailed observations without delay on the previous recommendations and with respect to the new allegations presented by the complainant organizations.

.At its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee notes with concern that, by and large, the Government confined itself to transmitting the information obtained from both partners without expressing any judgement.(b) The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations of various anti-union practices carried out by the company (telephone threats to workers, filming of demonstrations in order to put pressure on the employees, infiltration of workers' meetings by managers, cutting of barbed-wire fences to avoid the picket line and intimidation of workers to return to work during a work stoppage) and to send it detailed information in that regard.(c) Observing that accompaniment by security guards could be considered in certain circumstances as a necessary measure, but that such a procedure should not result in any interference in internal trade union affairs or in the capacity of trade union representatives to communicate freely with workers in order to apprise them of the potential advantages of unionization, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that union officials have the necessary space to communicate freely with workers without interference from the employer and without the presence of the employer or the security guards. It requests the Government to kept in informed in this regard.(d) With regard to the establishment of a workers' representation body parallel to the Union, and considering that the discussion forums or communication programmes promoted by the company do not in themselves constitute a violation of freedom of association, the Committee requests the Government to adopt measures to ensure, in light of the findings of the investigation into the alleged anti-union practices, that these are not used to the detriment of the Union, which is the only body that can guarantee independence both in its establishment and its operation.(e) Observing with regret that the Government has not sent its observations on Unilever s non-recognition of the National Trade Union Committee, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation promptly into this allegation and to inform it accordingly.(f) With regard to the distribution of resignation forms and the setting up of a toll-free telephone line providing information on how to resign from the Union, the Committee requests the Government to put into place a mechanism that would enable it to rapidly redress any effects of this type of interference, including through the imposition of sufficiently dissuasive sanctions on the employer where appropriate, and to avoid such incidents in the future.
.In its communications of  May and  August , the Government stated that the Ministry of Labour was carrying out investigations into the allegations made in the present case. In its communication of  March , the Government stated that it was awaiting the conclusion of the investigations and the report on the measures adopted by the Ministry in connection with its investigation at the Unilever company into allegedly anti-union practices.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that Unilever was ordered to respect the rights of the union movement. The Government states that the Labour Judge of the Third Labour Court of Jundia approved in its entirety the public civil judgement which had been examined by the Ministry of Labour, and ordered that Unilever immediately desist from practices aimed at influencing workers in their decisions to join or leave a union, or to persuade them not to carry out",-1,2005,Brazil
44,"union activities. The complaint was lodged by the Unified Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers (Vinhedo Region), and during the ensuing hearings, the Regional Public Prosecutor for Labour, having heard the statements of company and union representatives, confirmed that there had been irregularities. Failure to comply with the decision will result in the imposition by the court of a , real fine for any instance of non-compliance with any of the specific obligations to refrain from anti-union action. Specifically, this means desisting immediately from any of the following acts: () putting pressure on workers to join or leave a union, or to cease union activities; () requiring employees to use any telephone service, particularly if it involves the company, to register union membership, or requiring employees to seek company authorization to join the union or have union membership dues deducted at source from wages; () dismissals without prior judicial inquiry, or applying any other sanction such as discounting days on which union officials had not worked in order to attend to union business, up to the limit provided for in the collective agreement, or any transfer of a union official to another establishment without his or her agreement, within the statutory period; it will also not be permitted to treat union officials in a discriminatory manner for the mere reason of holding union office, or to initiate any proceedings against workers who associate with union officials or show sympathy for union activities; () carrying out any form of reprisal or discriminatory act against employees or against unions on grounds of union membership or activity; () refusing to employ a worker because of his or her union membership or intention to join a union; () preventing or obstructing union officials from entering company premises in order to disseminate information on matters of interest to the workers, or preventing the use of notices, meetings, or other means of informing workers on union issues of interest to them, the aim being to ensure the freedom to organize union events within and outside company premises; () obstructing the freedom to conduct peaceful picketing without interference by the company, the aim being to ensure that workers enjoy the rights provided for in the law on strikes and in the national Constitution; () recording on video or any other photographic recording medium workers' demonstrations or meetings without the prior consent of the workers concerned or of their union; () obstructing the participation by the authorized union representative in the work of the commission that may be set up to discuss profit sharing under the terms of section  of Act No. ./; and () failing to invite workers in writing in due time, in accordance with the deadlines and terms set out in the collective agreement, where one exists, for the purpose of elections to the internal accident prevention committee.
.In its communication of  February , the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour and the Unilever group had reached an agreement, approved by the courts, whose terms reaffirmed the principles set out in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, particularly those concerning respect for freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. The agreement provides for a fine, to be determined by the court, in case of anti-union acts committed by the Unilever group.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations that had remained pending in this case referred mainly to acts of anti-union discrimination which, according to the complainant organizations, had been committed by the Unilever company (telephone threats against workers, filming of demonstrations in order to put pressure on workers, infiltration of workers' meetings by managers, cutting wire fences to avoid picket lines and intimidation of workers to make them return to work during a work stoppage, having union officials accompanied by security guards, distribution of forms for leaving the union, and setting up a toll-free telephone line allowing workers to resign from the union; and its refusal to recognize the National Trade Union Committee) [see th Report, paras ' ].
.The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that: () investigations were carried out by the Ministry of Labour into the allegations, and the labour judge of the Third Labour Court of Jundia ordered the company to desist immediately from practices aimed at influencing workers in their decision to join or resign from a union or persuading them to cease their union activities; () the complaint was lodged by the Unified Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers (Vinhedo Region) and, during the ensuing hearings, the Regional Public Prosecutor for Labour, having heard statements by company and union representatives, confirmed that there had been irregularities; and () failure to abide by the court ruling will result in a , real fine for every instance of non-compliance with the obligations to desist from the anti-union acts specified in the ruling; and () the Ministry of Labour and the Unilever group had reached an agreement, approved by the courts, whose terms reaffirmed the principles concerning freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively and which provides for a fine to be determined by the court in case of anti-union acts.
.The Committee, while regretting the anti-union actions which were found by the court to have taken place, notes with interest the remedial measures ordered by the court, in particular the injunction issued by the court to prevent any recurrence or the carrying out of similar actions and the agreement reached in this regard. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the principles of freedom of association are respected within the Unilever company.
.The Committee notes with interest the agreement concluded between the Ministry of Labour and the Unilever group. The Committee requests the Government to provide relevant information on the consideration given to the refusal to recognize the National Trade Union Committee and the alleged establishment of a parallel workers' representative body within the framework of the investigations, the judicial ruling and the agreement concluded.

.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ) but has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The Taubat Metalworkers' Union, a member of the CUT, currently represents , workers in the cities of Taubat and Trememb, , of whom are union members.
.The Union recalls that trade union autonomy was enshrined in the current Federal Constitution, enacted in , which removed several obstacles that had hindered trade union activity, prohibiting any form of intervention by the authorities in internal trade union organization. However, despite the constitutional provision, some public authorities do not respect the principle of freedom of association and their actions constitute a violation of the Constitution and of the fundamental principles of the ILO.
.The trade union alleges that it was the victim of an intervention on the part of the authorities, through the judiciary, constituting serious interference in the life of the organization. The union Statute provides that the term of office for union leaders is four years. Given that the current leaders began their term of office on  November , elections were called in  to replace them. The union points out that elections are an act of internal autonomy and are conducted in a similar way to an assembly, divided into several sessions, under the supervision of trade union representatives. Three candidatures registered for the elections, with  candidates each. Votes were due to be cast on ,  and  July . The trade union alleges that the elections were taking place in a democratic and peaceful fashion when, on the morning of the  July , a judge from the city of Taubat, Dr. Jorge Alberto Passos Rodrguez, made a serious administrative intervention in the elections which significantly affected the election results. Indeed, on the pretext of carrying out an order from the So Paulo State Court of Justice that equal treatment should be guaranteed for one of the electoral lists, the judge gave the instruction to intervene in the union election assembly, and personally assumed responsibility for administering the elections and establishing new rules of electoral administration, in absolute violation of the trade union Statutes. The judge gave orders for the following measures to be taken: (a) evacuation of the court building, which was immediately surrounded by military police; (b) summons of the police to force entry into the union offices in order to implement the subsequent measures; (c) suspension of the elections; (d) seizure of all ballot boxes and voting papers (thereafter, taken to the court headquarters) and cancellation of votes already cast; (e) order to forcibly take those incharge of the voting committees to the court buildings; (f) establishing the court as the voting headquarters, and restricting access to only one lawyer per candidature registered; (g) forcible removal of the election coordinator to his office in order for him to hand over all information relating to the administration of the elections; and (h) order to display notices in the workplaces explaining what was happening. It should be pointed out that during implementation of point (g), the union president arrived at the court in a police vehicle and was greeted by a crowd shouting  thief'   criminal' and  cheat'  The crowd, seeing the president in that situation, had wrongly assumed that he had been detained for having committed a crime. The union stresses the negative repercussions of that incident, in a city of only , inhabitants, on the very day of the elections, particularly given that one of the lists of candidates took advantage of the situation and spread the false rumour through a statement that was sent out to all factories and workers.
.The trade union submits that the order for equal treatment was addressed to the union president, and that failure to comply with it would have nullified the election. The judge should certainly not have removed the union leaders from the administration of the election and taken their place. By his actions, the judge committed an abuse of power. Once voting was over, the representative of the Ministry of Labour declared one of the candidatures to have been elected, despite the fact that it had not won the number of votes necessary to be declared elected (half plus one of the valid votes, according to the Statute). The judge s actions were outside the judicial sphere and took on a purely administrative nature, constituting intervention and interference in the union. Two judicial appeals were lodged against the judge s acts, but they had no immediate effect. The So Paulo State Court of Justice refused all preliminary requests to suspend the judicial orders, and the appeals are due to be heard within six months. However, there is no possibility according to domestic legislation of rapid intervention by the Federal Supreme Court to change the situation created by the aforementioned abuses. The union states that on  November  the violation was factually and legally confirmed, since the candidates elected in the manipulated elections took office on that date.
.Lastly, the union points out that the judicial intervention violated several articles of the Statute, article  of the Constitution and Article  of Convention No. .
.In a communication dated  June , the Government forwards the information supplied by the judge, Dr. Mohamed Amaro, third Vice-President of the So Paulo State Court of Justice, and by the judge of the First Civil Instance of the region of Taubat, Mr. Jorge Alberto Passos Rodrguez. Dr. Amaro s information concerns the two appeals (security orders) lodged by the complainant organization in an attempt to declare null and void the elections carried out with the intervention of the judiciary. He explains that one of the lists of candidates (No. ) in the union election had presented a request for enforcement of constitutional rights in favour of Messrs. Jeremas Pereira de Castro, Jos Donizete Lopes, Ccero Batista and Benedito Raimundo de Carvalho. That request was met essentially to guarantee their participation in the trade union elections planned for ,  and  July . Dr. Amaro points out that the first appeal was presented by the complainant on  July and that, given that some facts were contested, he decided to deny the request for preliminary action, in order to allow more time to gather information. He ordered an investigation into the relevant information and sent summons to the passive parties, i.e. those in whose favour the questioned decision had been made (electoral list ). The orders were sent to the Office of the Prosecutor-General for his approval, after which they would be distributed for court proceedings.
.Regarding the complainant s second appeal, he states that it was presented against the actions taken by the judge of the First Civil Instance of the region of Taubat, Mr. Jorge Alberto Passos Rodrguez. The allegation, in summary, is that the judicial authority intervened in an abusive manner in the union election process, organizing the elections without having been asked to do so, on the pretext of carrying out a decision by the So Paulo State Court of Justice, taken by Judge Maia da Cunha. The complainant states that those actions are invalid and requests that the elections should be declared null and void and that new elections be held in accordance with the Statutes of the union, without interference from the judiciary. The request for preliminary action was also turned down in this case, given the complexity of the facts that, moreover, are disputed. These orders are also before the Office of the Attorney-General for his approval and subsequent distribution for court proceedings. The Government includes, as an appendix, several documents that are part of the respective judicial proceedings.
.In the explanations given by the judge of the First Civil Instance instance, Mr. Jorge Alberto Passos Rodrguez, who intervened directly in the electoral process, he denies having acted illegally, abused his power or acted in an arbitrary nature. He explained that he received the documents on  July , after the So Paulo State Court of Justice had granted the request for enforcement of constitutional rights presented by electoral list No. , and ordered the then union president, Antonio Eduardo Oliveira, to guarantee equal treatment for that list. Paragraph (e) of the decision states that  the president/candidate",-1,2003,Brazil
47,"and the coordinator of the election, by means of specific protection, must ensure that equal treatment is given to the competing electoral lists in the current election process, with attention to the requests already made to the election coordinators by list No. , regarding voting materials, distribution of ballot boxes, counting of votes, parity on the returning officers' committees ('  and maintaining equality in all other matters relating to the election' 
.Mr. Antonio Eduardo Oliveira, who was presiding over the election in his capacity as union president, and was also running as a candidate, informed the court that he would not comply with the order since that in itself would infringe on the provisions of the Social Statute of the union regarding voting materials, distribution of ballot boxes, composition of the collection committees (article  of the Statute) and parity on the returning officers' committees. He stated that to comply with such a decision would invalidate the electoral process. Therefore, since the decision of the Court of Justice was not to be implemented, and considering that applying financial sanctions would be pointless, given that what was required was compliance with the order of equal treatment and that the election was already under way, the judge issued the decision that the order should be implemented at  p.m. that day; he immediately suspended the casting of votes and ordered voting to begin again.
.The ballot boxes ready for voting were confiscated, and the representatives of the different lists, including those on list No.  which had not been mentioned in any documents, were compelled to present themselves in a specific room in the civil court building, as a means of maintaining order at that time. Furthermore, the judge ordered that all electoral committee members be taken to the court, with a police escort, and that the election coordinator should also be present to provide the necessary information in accordance with the Court of Justice decision. He instructed, moreover, that notices should be displayed in the polling stations indicating that the elections would begin again later that day, which is indeed what happened. The votes that had already been cast were discarded and placed in appropriate bundles. Joint commissions were established, made up of representatives from the different lists and lots were drawn for the presidency from among the commissions, with names provided by the different lists, including the list of the complainants. The ballot boxes were initialled by all those present in the meeting room. In order to ensure that the correct procedure was followed, it was begun in the presence of justice officials and with the support of the police. The judge states that, in agreement with the president appointed for the vote, which ended in the early morning of  August , list No.  gained the largest number of votes, with , votes; list No.  received , and list No.  (which included, amongst others, the president of the complainant organization) obtained  votes; there were  blank and  invalid ballot papers, out of a total of , votes. Consequently, list No.  was declared elected, as stated in the record of the general ballot of the election and closure of the election process.
.The judge confirms that there was no intervention in the complainant union. Rather, some judicial action was taken, aimed at guaranteeing effective compliance with the decision of the So Paulo State Court of Justice. He states that union activities, which are so important for workers, are necessarily subject to judicial orders. Regarding the claim that list No.  did not obtain the majority established in article  of the Social Statute, which led the complainant to request the invalidation of the election, the judge points out that the Statute only provides for re-election in the case of a draw, which did not happen in this instance. There is no possibility of invalidating the casting of votes, the ballot, or the declaration of the result, since none of the circumstances established in the Statute (articles /) has occurred, and the election took place in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice, that urgent and specific enforcement of constitutional rights be granted. The result is therefore worthy of respect.
.Lastly, the Government emphasized that direct judicial participation took place only because the complainant itself expressly notified the authorities that it would not comply with the decision of the Court of Justice, without providing detailed reasons, but only brief and general statements. Thus, article No.  of the Statute is applicable according to which, an event cannot be invalidated by the entity that caused the invalidation.
.The Committee notes that the current case concerns allegations of undue judicial interference in the election held to appoint new trade union leaders to the Taubat Metalworkers' Union, and non-observance of the existing provisions of its Social Statute. The complainant requests that the aforementioned vote be declared null and void and new elections be held.Intervention in the election
.The Committee notes that the election to appoint new union leaders to the complainant organization were set to take place on ,  and  July . According to the union, the elections constitute an act of internal autonomy and are conducted in a similar way to an assembly, divided into several sessions, under the supervision of trade union representatives. Three candidatures registered for the elections, with  candidates each. According to the complainant, the elections were taking place in a democratic and peaceful fashion when, on the morning of  July , a judge of the First Civil Instance from the city of Taubat made a serious administrative intervention in the elections, which significantly affected the election results. According to the information provided by the Government, on the day before the elections, one of the lists registered for the voting process (No. ) had presented a request for enforcement of constitutional rights to the So Paulo State Court of Justice, in favour of Messrs. Jeremas Pereira de Castro, Jos Donizete Lopes, Ccero Batista and Benedito Raimundo de Carvalho, requesting recognition and equal treatment during the elections. That request was intended essentially to guarantee their participation in the trade union elections. Paragraph (e) of the judicial decision stated that  the president/candidate and the coordinator of the election, by means of specific protection, must ensure that equal treatment is given to the competing electoral lists in the current election process, with attention to the requests already made to the election coordinators by list No. , regarding voting materials, distribution of ballot boxes, counting of votes, parity on the returning officers' committees ('  and maintaining equality in all other matters relating to the election' 
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that the judge of the First Civil Instance, on the pretext of carrying out the aforementioned order, gave the instruction to intervene in the union election assembly, and personally assumed responsibility for administering the elections and establishing new rules of electoral administration, in absolute violation of the union Statutes. The complainant adds that the order for equal treatment was addressed to the union president, and that failure to comply with it would have nullified the election. It holds that the judge should certainly not have removed the union leaders from the administration of the election and taken their place and that by his actions, he committed an abuse of power. The Committee notes, however, that the Government maintains in this respect that Mr. Antonio Eduardo Oliveira, who was presiding over the election in his capacity as union president, and was also running as a candidate, informed the court that he would not comply with the order since that itself would infringe on the provisions of the Social Statute of the union regarding voting materials, distribution of ballot boxes, composition of the collecting committees and parity on the returning officers' committees, stating that to comply with such a decision would invalidate the electoral process. According to information provided by the judge of the First Civil Instance who intervened, he issued the decision to implement the court order at  p.m. that day, taking into account that the decision would not be put into practice considering that subsequent application of financial sanctions would be pointless, and given that the election was already under way. Under those circumstances, he decided to suspend immediately the casting of votes and to order voting to begin again. The Committee notes that the Government emphasizes that direct judicial participation took place only because the complainant itself expressly notified the authorities that it would not comply with the decision of the Court of Justice without providing detailed reasons, thus leading to application of article No.  of the Statute, according to which an event cannot be invalidated by the entity that caused the invalidation. Likewise, the judge of the First Civil Instance maintains that there is no possibility of invalidating the collection of votes, the ballot, or the declaration of the result, since none of the circumstances laid down in",-1,2003,Brazil
48,"the Statute (articles /) has occurred, and the election took place in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice, that urgent enforcement of constitutional rights be granted. The Committee emphasizes that in cases where the results of trade union elections are challenged, such questions should be referred to the judicial authorities in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure which should also be expeditious [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , th edition, para. ]. In that respect, noting that the judicial decisions adopted by the judge of the First Civil Instance have been questioned before the law, through the lodging of two appeals (security orders), the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the rulings as soon as the appeals have been settled and expects that they will be handed down without delay.Measures taken
.The Committee takes note of the measures taken by the judge of the First Civil Instance while the electoral process was under way, particularly: suspension of the elections; seizure of all ballot boxes and voting papers (thereafter, taken to the court headquarters) and cancellation of votes already cast; and establishment of the court as the voting headquarters, restricting access to only one lawyer per candidature registered. Furthermore, the order was issued that all electoral committee members be taken to the court with a police escort, and that the election coordinator should also be present to provide the necessary information in accordance with the decision of the Court of Justice. The Judge instructed, moreover, that notices should be displayed in the polling stations indicating that the elections would begin again later that day, which is indeed what happened. Joint commissions were established, made up of representatives from the different lists, and lots were drawn for the presidency from among the commissions, with names provided by the different lists, including the list of the complainants. The ballot boxes were initialled by all those present in the meeting room. Lastly, according to the Government, in order to ensure that the correct procedure was carried out, it was begun in the presence of justice officials and with the support of the police. The Committee notes that the Government and the complainant organization provide similar descriptions of the measures taken. In this respect, noting that those measures were questioned before the So Paulo State Court of Justice, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the rulings as soon as the appeals have been settled and expects that they will be handed down without delay.Incident concerning the union president duringthe undertaking of those measures
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that when the union president was taken to the court in a police vehicle, in compliance with the orders of the intervening judge, he was greeted by a crowd shouting  thief'   criminal' and  cheat'  The crowd, seeing the president in that situation, had wrongly presumed that he had been detained for having committed a crime. According to the complainant, that incident had negative repercussions on the election results because it happened in a city of only , inhabitants, on the very day of the elections, particularly given that one of the lists of candidates took advantage of the situation and spread the false rumour through a statement that was sent out to all the factories and workers. The Committee notes that the Government has not included any information on that aspect of the complaint. The Committee considers that the fact that the union president was forcibly transferred in a police vehicle, without previously being given the opportunity to appear voluntarily, could constitute a harmful incident for the union president, and expects that in future there will be no further recourse to such measures unless they are unavoidable in order to comply with judicial decisions.Election results
.The Committee notes that, with regard to the election results, the complainant alleges that once voting was over, the representative of the Ministry of Labour declared one of the candidatures to have been elected, despite the fact that it had not won the necessary number of votes (the complainant confirms that according to the Statute, half plus one of the valid votes must be gained to win the election). According to the information provided by the Government, list No.  gained the largest number of votes, with , votes; list No.  received , and list No.  (which included, amongst others, the president of the complainant organization) obtained  votes; there were  blank and  invalid ballot papers, out of a total of , votes. Consequently, list No.  was declared elected, as stated in the record of the general ballot of the election and closure of the election process. The Committee notes that, regarding the claim that list No.  did not obtain the majority established in article  of the Statute, and thus the vote should be declared invalid, the Government points out that the Statute only provides for re-election in the case of a draw, which did not happen in this instance. The Committee notes that article  of the Statute provides that  once voting has concluded, the president of the voting committee will declare elected the list that obtained the simple majority of valid votes (' '  The Statute does not include a specific definition of the term  simple majority'  however, according to the meaning it is normally given,  simple majority' refers to the modality in the decision-making process that requires the highest number of votes cast, not half plus one, which would be an absolute majority. Nevertheless, noting that this aspect of the case is also questioned by means of the appeals lodged before the So Paulo State Court of Justice, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the rulings as soon as the appeals have been settled and expects that they will be handed down without delay.Appeals lodged
.The Committee notes that the complainant has presented two judicial appeals (security orders) against the actions of the judge of the First Civil Instance, to secure the invalidation of the elections that took place with the intervention of the judiciary. In both cases, according to the information provided by the third Vice-President of the So Paulo State Court of Justice, the preliminary requests were denied, given that some facts were contested and the facts were complex, in order to allow more time to gather the necessary information; the documents were sent to the Office of the Attorney-General for his approval, after which they will be distributed for court proceedings. The Committee recalls once again that in cases where the results of trade union elections are challenged, such questions should be referred to the judicial authorities in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure which should also be expeditious [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee, noting that the decisions taken by the judge of the First Civil Instance during the election process in this case have been questioned before the judicial authorities, and that the outcomes are pending, requests the Government to send it a copy of the rulings and expects that they will be handed down without delay.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Noting that the decisions and measures taken by the judge of the First Instance during the election process in this case have been questioned before the judicial authorities and that the outcomes are pending, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the rulings and expects that they will be handed down without delay.(b) Regarding the incident during which the union president was taken to the court in a police vehicle, the Committee considers that the fact that he was forcibly transferred in a police vehicle could constitute a harmful incident, and expects that in future there will be no further recourse to such measures unless they are unavoidable in order to comply with the judicial decisions.",-1,2003,Brazil

.In a communication dated  August , the Government states that, once the decision regarding the murder of trade union leader Carlos Alberto Oliveira Santos has been handed down, it will be sent to the Committee. The Government encloses extensive documentation on the development of the legal proceedings, from which it emerges that those having participated in the crime, including the perpetrator, have been identified and detention orders have been issued.
.The Committee takes note of this information and awaits the decision to be handed down regarding the murder of trade union leader Carlos Alberto Oliveira Santos.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee had requested the Government to keep it informed of the result of inquiries made and of the corresponding court judgements aimed at ensuring that those responsible for the murder of trade unionist Mr. Carlos Alberto Santos would be promptly punished [see th Report, para. ].
.In its communications of  February  and  March , the Government indicates that, as part of the criminal proceedings opened in this matter, the Attorney-General of the State of Sergipe has filed charges of murder against two individuals, whose preventive detention has also been requested. The Government also sent numerous information on the status of the proceedings.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to provide it with the court judgement as soon as it is issued.
.The Committee last examined this case, which concerns the murder of trade union leader Carlos Alberto Santos, at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of developments in the ongoing investigations.
.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that: () evidence gathered during the police investigation indicates that the crime was not related to the victim s trade union activities; and () the Comarca Criminal Court is awaiting final statements before giving a ruling on two persons charged with the crime.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to supply the text of the final ruling handed down in this respect.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee deeply deplored the murder of the trade union leader Carlos Alberto Santos and urged the Government to ensure that the investigations to clarify the facts and determine those responsible were concluded rapidly so that anyone having participated in this murder, including the perpetrators, were punished as required by law. The Committee also requested the Government to keep it informed of developments in the legal proceedings.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Employment, based on information from the Ministry s Regional Unit in the State of Sergipe, informed it that the police investigation opened in that State to clarify the facts and determine those responsible was concluded on  May , and led to the discovery of two unidentified bodies, which could be those of the trade unionist s murderers, although there was not enough evidence yet to reach such a conclusion. The Government states further that a special task force has been set up at state level, composed of officers of the federal police and the civil police, with responsibility for carrying out an in-depth inquiry. The eyewitnesses of the crime are under maximum protection.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigations opened and the corresponding legal proceedings aimed at ensuring that those responsible for the murder of Mr. Carlos Alberto Santos are promptly punished.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The Government replied in communications dated  November and  December .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October , the ICFTU reported the murder of Carlos Alberto Santos Oliveira, known as  Gato'  who was President of the Sergipe Citriculture Workers' Trade Union. The murder occurred on  September  at . in the evening when five gunmen shot the victim eight times at close range. Carlos Alberto Santos Oliveira was well know at the international level for his work for the rights of rural workers and the abolition of child labour. The complainant assumes that it was for this very reason that he was murdered as he frequently condemned the use of child labour on the orange plantations.
.In communications dated  November and  December , the Government stated that the Special Operations Centre (COPE), in collaboration with the Federal Police, is investigating the circumstances of the murder of Carlos Alberto  Gato' Santos Oliveira and that there is already evidence showing that this occurred as a result of the trade union and political activities of the victim. The Government also states that the following have been accused and detained: Nelson Jos Nilton dos Santos, Finance Secretary of the city of Tomar do Geru; Valmir dos Santos Souza, Chief of the Military Police and Personal Safety of the Prefect of Tomar do Geru; and Gildeon F. da Silva, Prefect of Tomar do Geru. Elizeu Santos, Prefect of Cristinapolis may also be added to this list (the State Court is reviewing the relevant judicial orders for imprisonment). The Government indicates that, although at this time it is unable to reveal any more with regard to the investigations, in order to ensure that these are successful and that the two witnesses to the case are protected, the ILO will be informed of developments and the outcome of the legal proceedings as soon as is expedient.
.The Committee notes with concern and deeply deplores the murder of Carlos Alberto Santos Oliveira, President of the Sergipe Citriculture Workers' Trade Union on  September . The Committee notes that both the complainant and the Government believe that this took place as a means of halting the important trade union and political work of the victim. The Committee also notes the Government s statement that the Special Operations Centre (COPE) is investigating the circumstances of this murder in collaboration with the Federal Police and that the authorities will prosecute the suspects. The Committee also notes that once the duty of silence surrounding the legal proceedings is lifted, the Government will inform the Committee of developments and indicate where responsibilities lie. The Committee recalls that  the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, para. ]. The Committee urges the Government to ensure that the investigations initiated in order to clarify the facts and determine those responsible are concluded rapidly so that anyone having participated in this murder, including the perpetrators, are punished as required by law. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the legal proceedings.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Deeply deploring the murder of the trade union leader, Carlos Alberto Santos, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that the investigations to clarify the facts and determine those responsible are concluded rapidly so that anyone having participated in this murder, including the perpetrators, are punished as required by law. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the legal proceedings.",-1,2001,Brazil
50,".The Committee last examined this case concerning allegations of the failure to engage in collective bargaining, exclusive bargaining with higher level trade union organizations, discrimination against trade union officers and insufficient protection against arbitrary dismissal at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion the Committee made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the projected negotiations on the participation of employees of Banco do Brasil S.A. concerning profit-sharing arrangements.(b) The Committee recalled that according to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining embodied in Article  of Convention No. , the determination of the bargaining level was essentially a matter to be left to the discretion of the parties. The Committee also emphasized that the imposition by law of a trade union monopoly was not compatible with the principles of freedom of association, and therefore urged the Government to ensure that national law was brought into conformity with those principles.(c) Although the Committee did not consider the reduction in the number of trade union representatives authorized to carry out their duties at the cost of the enterprise to be contrary to the principles of freedom of association, given that it was the result of collective bargaining, it requested the Government to prevent any discrimination between trade unions in that context.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government informs the Committee that in the past two months Banco do Brasil has held various meetings with its employees on their sharing in the profits and results of the enterprise. It states that it will continue to endeavour to reach an agreement with legally authorized trade unions.
.With regard to the trade union monopoly, the Government reiterates that it does not discriminate between trade unions by negotiating exclusively with CONTEC, according to which CTNIF is neither legal nor constitutionally competent to represent employees at the negotiations. The Government also states that as the Constitution prohibits the establishment of more than one trade union organization at any level representing a professional or economic category in the same territorial division, CONTEC requested in law that the registration of CTNIF as a trade union be cancelled, and this took place on  December .
.Finally the Government states that, according to national legislation, trade union leaders at the Banco do Brasil have paid time off to carry out their trade union duties, entirely at the cost of the enterprise according to the collective agreements that the enterprise holds with its trade union bodies. The Government adds that of the  trade union leaders with paid time off to carry out their trade union duties at the cost of the enterprise,  are members of CONTEC and  are members of trade unions that are not affiliated to the latter.
.The Committee takes due note of this information. It notes that  of the  trade union leaders at the Banco do Brasil belong to trade unions that are not affiliated with CONTEC. However, it deplores that the CTNIF was struck from the trade union registry and invites the Government to take the necessary measures to repeal the provisions setting forth a trade union monopoly.
.In its communication of  August , the National Confederation of Financial Institutions Workers (CNTIF), which groups together  banking trade unions and seven federations, and is affiliated to the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT), states that the Government of Brazil, through Banco do Brasil S.A., a mixed enterprise, fails to comply with Conventions Nos. ,  and, therefore, , for the following reasons.
.The CNTIF states that up to and including August , Banco do Brasil S.A. negotiated with its employees their share in the profits and results of the enterprise, as provided for in the Political Constitution and regulated by Provisional Measure No. -. This profit-sharing was decided upon with trade union participation, either through direct negotiation and conclusion of the collective agreement, or through a negotiating committee whose members were designated by the parties (the trade union in question was represented in this committee). However, the complainant alleges that, in violation of the aforementioned provisions, Banco do Brasil S.A. unilaterally changed these profit-sharing arrangements, and the Government endorsed this by amending the abovementioned Provisional Measure. According to the complainant, these acts constitute an infringement of collective freedom of association, and this is corroborated by the fact that the Federal Supreme Court reaffirmed the obligation to ensure that trade unions are present in negotiating committees.
.The CNTIF alleges further that Banco do Brasil S.A. is excluding the trade unions from collective bargaining by holding talks with the National Confederation of Workers of Credit Enterprises (CONTEC), whereas the trade unions had specifically withdrawn this Confederation s authority to negotiate. The decision to withdraw this authority was made by a workers' assembly and notified to both the Confederation and the enterprise. The complainant maintains that the trade unions affiliated to CONTEC should maintain their freedom of association in the negative sense, meaning the freedom not to be represented in all areas by higher level organizations. However, the case law of the Supreme Labour Tribunal indicates that in the case of a collective dispute, confederations can act without the authorization of a trade union assembly. The complainant adds that Banco do Brasil S.A. even refuses to formalize collective bargaining with the trade unions, but not that with CONTEC. Furthermore, according to the Supreme Labour Tribunal, confederations have exclusive competence for resolving nationwide collective disputes, regardless of the wishes of first-level organizations. According to the complainant, this reversal is dangerous in that the representative nature of the Confederation is not legitimized directly by the workers, but by a council of representatives, and that trade union representativity is disregarded.
.The CNTIF also alleges that between  September  and  August , which coincided with the term of the collective agreement then in force, the bank demanded a reduction in the number of trade union officers who carried out their duties at the cost of the enterprise, and the deletion of the clause referring to representatives of first-level trade unions (which was still applicable during the term of the - agreement), thus refusing to recognize the right to organize at the workplace. According to the complainant, this deletion violates ILO Convention No. , which has been ratified by Brazil.
.Lastly, the CNTIF states that Banco do Brasil S.A., despite the fact that it is part of the public administration, does not provide its employees with adequate protection against arbitrary dismissal (in  over  employees were dismissed without just cause). In this regard, it points out that the bank considers  dismissal' to be a  sanction' for breach of discipline, thus enabling it to dismiss without justification senior employees and those recruited through competitions, even after long periods of service, in order to employ  interns' to make up for obviously inadequate staffing levels.
.With regard to the first allegation, the Government states that the bank has reached an agreement with the trade unions concerning profit-sharing, and distributes a share of the profits amongst employees in accordance with a programme based on the relevant Provisional Measure and approved by the supervisory body of the federal Government. There is a collective agreement which provides for negotiations regarding this matter.
.As for the allegation that Banco do Brasil S.A. engages in collective bargaining with a confederation without the consent of the trade unions and contrary to decisions taken in assembly, the Government states that it does not agree with the complainant asserting that Banco do Brasil S.A. negotiates and signs collective agreements with both the National Confederation of Workers of Credit Enterprises (CONTEC) and the trade unions. CONTEC is the national confederation legally authorized to represent banking employees on a national scale, in accordance with the federal Constitution and the legislation in force. It is therefore surprising that an organization with which the bank has never held negotiations has presented a complaint to the ILO.
.Concerning the alleged discriminatory treatment of trade union leaders, the Government states that Banco do Brasil S.A. has nearly  employees who have paid time off to carry out their trade union duties, entirely at the cost of the enterprise. It should be noted that during collective bargaining, the parties adopt strategic positions that are not always satisfactory for both sides. Therefore, to allow these complaints is to fail to recognize the negotiating process, which is aimed at reaching a settlement by consensus.
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that, in violation of the right to collective bargaining and contrary to previous practice, Banco do Brasil S.A., a mixed enterprise that up until September  engaged in collective bargaining with its employees concerning profit-sharing arrangements decided to change this profit-sharing system unilaterally. The Committee also notes that the Government endorsed this change by reflecting it in the Provisional Measure governing this issue. The Committee observes that according to the Government a collective agreement exists in which bargaining on all these issues is provided for. The",-1,2000,Brazil
51,"Committee recalls that in the view of the Committee of Experts, it is contrary to the provisions of Convention No.  to exclude from collective bargaining certain issues such as those relating to conditions of employment. Furthermore, measures taken unilaterally by the authorities to restrict the scope of negotiable issues are often incompatible with the Convention [see General Survey on freedom of association and collective bargaining, , paras.  and ]. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the projected negotiations.
.With regard to collective bargaining between Banco do Brasil S.A. and a trade union confederation which did not have the approval of first-level trade unions, and which had been denied the authority to negotiate by the latter, the Committee observes that article  of the federal Constitution enshrines trade union monopoly by prohibiting the establishment of more than one trade union organization at any level representing a professional or economic category in the same territorial division. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, CONTEC is the national confederation legally authorized to represent banking employees on a national scale. Similarly, the Committee observes that, according to the complainant, Banco do Brasil S.A. also refuses to formalize collective bargaining carried out with the trade unions, but not that held with CONTEC. It notes, moreover, that according to the case law of the Supreme Labour Tribunal, in the case of collective disputes, confederations can act without the authorization of a trade union assembly, and that trade union confederations are competent to settle nationwide collective disputes, regardless of the wishes of first-level organizations. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that according to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining embodied in Article  of Convention No. , the determination of the bargaining level is essentially a matter to be left to the discretion of the parties and, consequently, the level of negotiation should not be imposed by law, by decision of the administrative authority or by the case law of the administrative labour authority [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. Furthermore, the Committee emphasizes that the imposition by law of the trade union monopoly is not compatible with the principles of freedom of association, and, therefore urges the Government to ensure that national law is brought into conformity with these principles. Lastly, the Committee draws this legal aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Regarding the allegedly discriminatory treatment of trade union officers and representatives within the enterprise, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, Banco do Brasil S.A. has reduced the number of trade union leaders authorized to carry out their duties at the cost of the enterprise. In these circumstances, although the Committee does not consider this reduction to be contrary to the principles of freedom of association, given that it is the result of collective bargaining, it requests the Government to prevent any discrimination between trade unions in this context.
.Lastly, concerning the allegation of inadequate protection against arbitrary dismissal, the Committee notes that the complaint does not mention that these dismissals are the result of anti-union measures. Therefore, it will not pursue its examination of this matter.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the projected negotiations on the participation of employees of Banco do Brasil S.A. concerning profit-sharing arrangements.(b) The Committee recalls that according to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining embodied in Article  of Convention No. , the determination of the bargaining level is essentially a matter to be left to the discretion of the parties. The Committee also emphasizes that the imposition by law of a trade union monopoly is not compatible with the principles of freedom of association, and therefore urges the Government to ensure that national law is brought into conformity with these principles.(c) Although the Committee does not consider the reduction in the number of trade union representatives authorized to carry out their duties at the cost of the enterprise to be contrary to the principles of freedom of association, given that it is the result of collective bargaining, it requests the Government to prevent any discrimination between trade unions in this context.",-1,2000,Brazil
52,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns the refusal of the state government of Paran to deduct trade union membership dues, at its meeting in November  (see the Committee's th Report, paras. -).
.On that occasion the Committee suggested that the ""check-off"" facility should not be withdrawn because this could cause financial difficulties for trade union organizations and was not conducive to harmonious industrial relations, and requested the Government, as soon as the trade unions concerned presented proof of their members' authorization for the deduction of trade union dues, to take the necessary measures to make those deductions and ensure that they are promptly credited to the trade unions.
.In a communication dated  January  the Government indicates that, in accordance with the Committee's request, the state government of Paran has begun deducting trade union dues for those members who authorize it. The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March  from the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT). The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) states that, following the adoption of the  Constitution, which guarantees the right to form unions in the public sector, most of the existing civil associations in that sector became trade unions. The complainant states that since the beginning of , the government of the State of Paran has been carrying out anti-union acts. During January and February , the Government stopped deducting trade union dues for members of the Union of Teachers in the State and Municipal Public Systems and that from October of that year onwards, in retaliation for the union's protests against the reforms undertaken by the state government of Paran, deduction of the union dues of , unionized teachers in this state was stopped. From late  onwards, the state government extended this anti-union measure to the other public service unions. The complainant points out that this conduct on the part of the Paran state government violates the country's Constitution, national legislation and international conventions.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the union dues claimed by the unions are those referred to in section (b) of the Consolidated Labour Laws, under the terms of which trade union organizations are to be funded from members' contributions in the form established in union statutes or at the unions' general meetings. Such contributions are voluntary in nature, depend on the consent of each union member and are paid monthly. They are not compulsory, and the State of Paran cannot be asked to deduct trade union dues at source, since it might be asked by officials to return large sums of money deducted by mistake.
.The Government stresses that payment of the monthly trade union dues depends on the agreement of each member and that, in this regard, the Higher Labour Court has stated that the collective arrangement by which union dues are deducted from professional workers' salaries, whether or not they are union members, without their prior consent, is not compatible with Brazilian law. The Government states that as a result of this, it cannot continue to deduct union dues if it is not shown that the public servants in question are union members and, in particular, that they have given their express authorization for the deductions. Lastly, the Government states that the Court of Justice of the State of Paran has acknowledged that there is no obligation on the part of the state to deduct union dues from salaries.
.The Government states that the secretariat of the Paran state government previously deducted voluntary trade union contributions from employees' salaries. Following the enactment of State Decree No. / in January , this practice was stopped since, under the terms of the Decree, deductions other than compulsory deductions are allowed only with the express authorization of the officials concerned. In the light of this measure, the Union of Teachers in the State and Municipal Public Systems and the union representing public servants employed by departments of the State of Paran initiated protection (amparo) proceedings in the Paran State Court of Justice in order to obtain recognition of the right to have members' union dues deducted at source on a compulsory basis. The Government has supplied copies of the Court of Justice rulings which indicate that the requests for such protection have been rejected.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant alleges that from January  onwards, the government of the State of Paran stopped deducting the trade union dues of members of the Union of Teachers in the State and Municipal Public Systems and that starting in October of that year, in retaliation for the union's protests against the reforms undertaken by the state government, they stopped deducting the union dues of , unionized teachers in the state. This measure was extended to the other public service unions from late  onwards.
.The Committee notes that the complainant and the Government agree that the State of Paran had previously deducted trade union dues for members of the public sector unions and, starting in , stopped doing so. However, the versions of the two parties are mutually contradictory in terms of the reasons given for discontinuing the practice. While the complainant alleges that it was done as an anti-union measure in retaliation for the union's protests against the reforms undertaken by the government of the State of Paran, the Government states that it had previously deducted the union dues on a voluntary basis, but that under the terms of State Decree No. / (according to which non-compulsory deductions are allowed only with the express authorization of the officials concerned), it could not continue to withhold deductions without such authorization, which has also been demanded by the Higher Labour Court and by a number of court rulings in the State of Paran.
.In this regard, the Committee emphasizes that the requirement for the express authorization of a union's members for employers to be allowed to deduct trade union dues from wages is not at variance with the principles of freedom of association. However, the Committee considers that in the present case, abruptly stopping these deductions for a number of months could have caused serious economic damage to the trade unions in this sector. The Committee emphasizes that the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee deeply deplores that the government of the State of Paran did not adopt transition measures in order to prevent damage to the trade union organizations (for example, by informing the unions of the need to have the express authorization of the members and allowing a certain period for them to submit such authorization). Under these circumstances, the Committee hopes that in future such measures, which could seriously affect the finances of the unions concerned, will not be taken, and requests the Government, as soon as the trade unions present proof of their members' authorization for the deduction of trade union dues, to take the necessary measures to make those deductions and ensure that they are promptly transferred to the trade unions.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Recalling that the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations, the Committee requests the Government, as soon as the trade unions concerned present proof of their members' authorization for the deduction of trade union dues, to take the necessary measures to make those deductions and ensure that they are promptly transferred to the trade unions.",-1,1999,Brazil
53,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns interference by the authorities in the application of a collective agreement, at its meeting in November  [see th Report, paras. -]. At that time the Committee requested the Government ""to keep it informed of whether the enterprises of the Puerto Alegre port sector [had] denounced the collective agreement as a result of the meeting to which the complainant objected [called by the Executive Group for Port Modernization] and whether sanctions [had] been applied to them for complying with the agreement"".
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that it was not the National Ministry of Labour that had denounced the collective agreement but the Regional Labour Delegation of the State of Ro Grande do Sul. The latter had recognized the unlawful nature of a number of clauses in the collective agreement and had notified the parties concerned accordingly, urging them to adhere to the law. After lengthy negotiations, the parties promised the Office of the Regional Prosecutor for Labour to regularize the clauses that had led to the denunciation of the agreement, in order to avoid a lawsuit. The Regional Delegation also asked the trade union organizations that had signed the collective greement to correct the irregularities therein, to which it got the parties to agree. The trade unions themselves recognized the unlawfulness of the clauses that had led to the denunciation of the agreement. The collective agreement had in any case already expired, and the parties concerned agreed that they would meet the commitments that they had entered into with the Regional Delegation and the Office of the Regional Prosecutor as soon as the new collective agreement, which was currently in the process of negotiation, came into force.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.At its June  meeting, the Committee had requested the Government and the complainant ""to keep it informed of whether the enterprises of the Porto Alegre port sector (had) denounced the collective agreement as a result of the meeting to which the complainant objected (called by the Executive Group for Port Modernization) and whether sanctions (had) been applied to them for complying with the agreement"" (see th Report, para. ).
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that the agreement in question had been denounced by the National Ministry of Labour because it contained provisions in violation of the national legislation (detailed by the Government in its communication and including, for example, the failure to observe a minimum break of  hours between two shifts), and that no sanctions had been applied in respect of compliance with the collective agreement.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the National Confederation of Workers in Water and Air Transport, Fisheries and Ports (CONTTMAF) dated  October . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the National Confederation of Workers in Water and Air Transport, Fisheries and Ports (CONTTMAF) states that it has been informed by the trade unions of workers in the ports of the State of Rio Grande do Sul that after having engaged in collective bargaining in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution of Brazil, they had signed a collective agreement with the representatives of the enterprises in this sector. The complainant alleges that on  September , after numerous threats, the executive secretary of the Executive Group for Port Modernization (GEMPO) convened and held a meeting of port sector employers in a military facility in the city of Porto Alegre and ordered them to denounce immediately the collective agreement that had been concluded by mutual consent between the workers and the employers. According to the complainant, the executive secretary cited among other reasons the fact that the collective agreement was not to his liking and fixed a -day time limit for the enterprises in this sector to stop complying with the agreement, failing which coercive measures would be applied, such as a tax audit, withdrawal of their authorizations and the imposition of fines.
.In its communication dated  April  the Government explains that on  April  the President of the Republic, through Decree No. , established the Executive Group for Port Modernization (GEMPO) in order to coordinate the necessary measures to modernize the Brazilian port system and ensure full application of the provisions laid down in Act No. /. The Government states that section  of the Decree provides that measures shall be adopted to establish a new system of relations between workers and users of port services, in accordance with Act No.  of , and that measures shall be adopted in order to ensure the effective functioning of the manpower administration bodies and the port authorities and to streamline the structures and procedures of the port administrations. Since the Decree was promulgated, the GEMPO has adhered faithfully to the Government's commitment to modernize every aspect of Brazilian port life, in a democratic manner, and in the spirit of Act No. /, which values negotiation as the prime component of labour-management relations, by trying out a model for the privatization of port activities and devolving a substantial part of the decision-making authority that had previously belonged to the State to the local port community. The GEMPO has gradually introduced the changes prescribed by the Act, with broad participation of the port community and society itself and giving considerable attention to social aspects, to ensure that everyone benefits from the modernization process.
.The Government states that in Porto Alegre the trade union leadership has obstructed the application of this Act in order to maintain a status quo that has become entrenched over the decades and is characterized by unacceptable abuses on the part of the trade unions, using the powers granted to them by the State in the past to administer the supply of temporary labour, which ultimately became a means of serving the interests of the few to the detriment of the vast majority of workers. These trade union leaders wish to maintain this shameful chapter in the history of Brazilian ports, which is characterized by the obligation to hire workers in excess of actual needs, by illegal preferential treatment of some workers to the detriment of others, and even the conclusion of collective agreements that are in blatant violation of the national legislation.
.In this context, states the Government, the executive secretary of the Executive Group for Port Modernization (GEMPO) convened and held a meeting of employers in the Porto Alegre harbourmaster's office (public facilities that are accessible to Brazilian citizens) at which he advised employers to denounce the collective agreement for the sector on grounds of abuses committed by the trade unions under cover of this agreement, which had given rise to investigations into the management of the Manpower Administration Body (OGMO) by the labour inspectorate, in accordance with the legislation in force. The Government explains further that the unfortunate collective agreement had illegally transferred to the trade unions responsibilities which under Act No. / should be assumed by the OGMO and that the trade unions had in fact committed all kinds of abuses as a result of this illegal transfer of powers. The Government rejects the allegation that the executive secretary of the GEMPO had threatened the enterprises with tax audits and withdrawal of their authorizations and adds that the meeting in question had been held at the request of some of the port operators wishing to straighten out the chaotic situation prevailing in the OGMO of Porto Alegre, which had given rise to investigations by the labour inspectorate.
.Lastly, the Government states that the executive secretary of the GEMPO acted within the legal powers vested in him by the national legal system and in defence of the interests of society and the workers themselves. As regards the meeting held on  September , the Government points out that the executive secretary discussed with those present the need for appropriate restructuring of the OGMO of Porto Alegre as soon as possible, in the light of the investigations carried out by the inspectorates of the Ministry of Labour and the National Social Security Institute. The executive secretary also advised the enterprises to lodge complaints with the labour courts against the unfortunate collective agreement, since it was contrary to the legislation in force, in particular with regard to the powers vested in the OGMO, which could not be delegated.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant alleges that the authorities of the Executive Group for Port Modernization (GEMPO) convened a meeting of the enterprises of the port sector of the State of Rio Grande do Sul and ordered them to denounce the collective agreement that had been concluded with",-1,1998,Brazil
54,"the trade unions of workers of the sector, fixing a -day time limit for them to stop complying with the agreement, failing which coercive measures would be applied (tax audits, imposition of fines, etc.).
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, at the request of some port operators wishing to straighten out the chaotic situation prevailing in the Manpower Administration Body of Porto Alegre (which had given rise to investigations by the labour inspectorate), the executive secretary of the GEMPO had convened and held a meeting of port sector employers in the Porto Alegre harbourmaster's office, advising them to denounce the collective agreement in the sector () on grounds of abuses committed by the trade unions under cover of the agreement, which had given rise to investigations into the management of the Manpower Administration Body (OGMO) by the labour inspectorate, and () on the grounds that the collective agreement contained provisions contrary to the legislation in force. The Committee also notes that the Government rejects the allegation that the enterprises in the port sector had been threatened with the application of sanctions for complying with the collective agreement.
.The Committee notes, firstly, that, as regards the holding and proceedings of the meeting with the enterprises of the port sector of the city of Porto Alegre that had been convened by the GEMPO, the versions of the complainant and the Government contradict each other: according to the former, the GEMPO ""ordered"" the enterprises to denounce the collective agreement, while according to the Government the GEMPO ""advised"" the enterprises to do so. In this respect, the Committee observes that under the provisions of Decree No. / establishing the Executive Group for Port Modernization (GEMPO), the authorities of that body are empowered to hold a meeting in the event of problems arising in the management of the Manpower Administration Body of Porto Alegre (section (iv) of the Decree provides that: ""it is the responsibility of the GEMPO: to adopt measures aimed at ensuring the effective functioning of the manpower administration bodies"").
.Moreover, the Committee observes that at the time of the examination of this case (more than eight months after the meeting convened by the GEMPO was held) neither the complainant nor the Government have informed it that the enterprises of the Porto Alegre port sector have denounced the collective agreement as a result of the meeting to which the complainant objected or that sanctions have been applied to them for complying with the agreement in question. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the complainant and the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the complainant and the Government to keep it informed on whether the enterprises of the Porto Alegre port sector have denounced the collective agreement as a result of the meeting to which the complainant objected and to indicate whether sanctions have been applied to them for complying with the agreement.",-1,1998,Brazil
55,".At its March  meeting the Committee noted the information provided by the Government, particularly with regard to the reinstatement of  workers of the Post and Telegraph Enterprise (dismissed along with  other workers following a strike in September ) and expressed the hope that the pending judicial proceedings would be concluded without delay [see th Report, paras. -].
.In its communication dated  May  the Government sent a chart detailing the status of the proceedings relating to the  dismissed workers which shows that, in the majority of cases, the judicial authority ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and only refused reinstatement in a limited number of cases.
.The Committee notes this information with interest.
.At its November  meeting, the Committee had noted with interest the judicial decisions reinstating in their posts four additional officials of the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise, who had been dismissed following the strike of September , and requested the Government to inform it of the final outcome of the remaining judicial proceedings [see th Report, paras. -]. The total number of workers dismissed was  and the Government has regularly provided information on the judgements of reinstatement.
.In its communication of  January , the Government provides a table giving the status of proceedings concerning the  dismissed workers. According to this table, the court has ordered the reinstatement of  workers and confirmed the dismissal in a few cases; the remaining cases have not been finally decided yet.
.The Committee notes this information and, considering that these dismissals occurred in September , hopes that the pending proceedings will be concluded without delay. It requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.

.In a communication dated  January , the Government states that another three workers have been reinstated, in addition to the  workers who had already been reinstated when the case was last examined.
.The Committee notes this information with interest and requests the Government to inform it of the final outcome of the remaining judicial proceedings in question.
.The Committee last examined this case (concerning dismissals following a strike and other anti-union acts) at its meeting in November  [see rd Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the final outcome of all pending judicial proceedings concerning the  workers of the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT) who were dismissed after the strike held in September .
.In a communication dated  January , the Government states that six individual court cases are still pending before lower courts,  are the subject of appeals, three have yet to be declared receivable, the complaints in question having originally been ruled inadmissible. In  cases, the dismissed workers were reinstated; in two cases, the disputed dismissals were upheld after being ruled admissible; in one case, the dismissal was confirmed and compensation agreed upon by the parties; in one case, a worker was reinstated under the terms of a judicial decision; and in another case, dismissal with compensation was authorized by the court. Lastly, a court case was initiated by a worker who is currently on sick leave. Consequently, since the last meeting, eight workers have been reinstated following the resolution of their cases by lower courts.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to inform it of the final outcome of all the judicial proceedings in question.
.The Committee last examined this case (concerning dismissals following a strike and other anti-union acts) at its meeting in March  [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee took note of the communication sent by the Government in September  and requested the Government to inform it of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings concerning the  workers of the ECT enterprise who remained dismissed after the strike held in September .
.In a communication dated  June , the Government gives the Committee an account of the current status of each of the proceedings initiated in connection with this case. According to this account,  individual court cases are still pending before lower courts;  are the subject of appeals; three have yet to be declared admissible, the complaints in question having originally been ruled inadmissible. In ten cases the dismissed workers in question were reinstated; in two cases the disputed dismissals were upheld after being ruled admissible; in one case, the dismissal was confirmed and compensation agreed by the parties; in one case, a worker was reinstated under the terms of a court settlement; and in another case dismissal with compensation was authorized by the court. The last court case was initiated by a worker who is currently on sick leave.
.The Committee notes this information and requests the Government to inform it of the final outcome of all the judicial proceedings in question.
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting (see th Report, paras. -). The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); however, it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee observes that in its previous examination of the case it had requested the Government to: () inform it of the grounds for the dismissal of  workers following the strike held in September  of the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT); () to send it a copy of the new labour relations regulations at the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT), in order to compare them with the previous regulations; () to send its observations concerning the allegation about the impossibility, following the September  strike at the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT), for the trade union leaders to have access to the workplace; and () to provide information on compliance, in practice, with clause , subclauses ,  and , of the collective agreement applicable to the ECT enterprise, which relates to time off from work for trade union leaders so that they can carry out their trade union activities.
.Concerning the information requested on the grounds for the dismissal of  workers following the strike held in September  in the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT), the Committee notes that the Government informs it that: ()  of the  dismissed workers have been reinstated by the enterprise; and () the dismissal of the  workers who were not reinstated was based on the grounds of their having committed acts of violence such as damage to ECT property, physical or moral attacks on employees and ECT authorities and violent picketing. The Committee also notes that the persons concerned have lodged appeals with the judicial authorities. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings under way.
.Concerning the new labour relations regulations in the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT), the Committee observes that the new regulations provided by the Government are essentially intended for information and that it appears from the text supplied by the Government that the part relating to freedom of association reproduces the relevant provisions of legislation and merely states that trade unions may conclude a collective agreement following deliberations by the general assembly of the trade union convened especially for the purpose.
.Concerning the allegation about the impossibility, following the September  strike at the ECT, for the trade union leaders to have access to the workplace, the Committee notes the Government's statements to the effect that: () the terms of the collective agreements, signed between the enterprise and the FENTECT provide for access by trade union officers to the buildings, the time and duration of their visits being regulated accordingly; () under the agreements, access by trade union officers must be planned ahead of time so as not to disrupt the service; () the legislation provides that the parties may apply to the courts in order to obtain the application of a provision of a collective agreement; and () there is no evidence that the trade union organizations have instituted administrative or",-1,1998,Brazil
56,"judicial proceedings against the ECT. In this respect, given that the complainant's allegations are couched in general terms, the Committee will not continue its examination of these allegations.
.Concerning the issue of compliance in practice with clause , subclauses ,  and , of the collective agreement applicable to the ECT enterprise, which relates to time off from work for trade union leaders so that they can carry out their trade union activities, the Committee notes that the Government states in its reply that the collective agreements signed between the ECT and FENTECT contain a clause (reproduced by the Government) regulating the leave granted to union officers in order to carry out their activities and that the enterprise pays a certain number of officers (two per trade union and seven for the federation) their wages and other statutory benefits as if they were working. In these circumstances, given the lack of specific information provided by the complainant on this allegation, the Committee will not continue its examination of this issue.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Concerning the  workers of the ECT enterprise who are still dismissed after the strike held in September , the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings under way.
.The complaint in this case was submitted in a communication from the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) dated  August . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); however, it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  August , the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) states that the workers of the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT) -- a federal public enterprise -- are represented by more than two dozen workers' unions and one national federation. The complainant indicates that  August was fixed as the date for signing the annual renewal of the collective agreement in the enterprise, and that during negotiations relating to the renewal of the collective agreement for the period -, the enterprise rejected the workers' claims; as a result they decided to take strike action which lasted  days. According to the CUT, during the negotiations, and during and following the strike, the Government and the enterprise committed a number of acts of anti-union discrimination. More specifically, the complainant makes the following allegations:-- once the strike was over, a policy of reprisals was unleashed against the workers who had taken part in it. More than , workers were dismissed, including just over  trade union officials and members of internal accident prevention committees;-- despite the end of the work stoppage at the enterprise, the trade union leaders were refused access to the workplace;-- in a number of workplaces, the regional director of the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise in the State of Rio de Janeiro screened a video containing false information about the trade union and the strike;-- restrictions were placed on trade union leaders being freed from their professional obligations to exercise their trade union activities;-- the enterprise published a Manual of Trade Union Relations, which incites directors to commit various anti-union practices with the aim of discrediting the trade unions and creating a tense atmosphere between the trade unions, the enterprise and the workers; the complainant attaches a copy of the manual and points out the provisions relating to the following issues:(i) contingency plan: ""this is a managerial instrument (an administrative tool) which, when used correctly, will harmonize the enterprise's actions, so as to make provision for and minimize the direct and indirect effects of strike action and its repercussions in the present and the future""; (ii) threats to family members: ""involve the family in the enterprise's communication process -- spoken and written, country, spouses --"". According to the complainant, this aims to demonstrate to possible supporters of the strike the inadvisability of participating in it; (iii) exemplary punishment: ""discipline must be maintained in the enterprise. It is recommended to act carefully when applying disciplinary measures so that excessive or liberal measures do not prejudice the hierarchy. In short, fairness and firmness in disciplinary measures, when they are necessary. Footnote: Ideally, disciplinary measures should serve as an example""; and (iv) excessive police presence: ""confirm with the responsible officials already designated in the regional contingency plan in order to carry out: security measures ..."". The complainant alleges that despite the fact that the enterprise has its own security team, during the September  strike the Military Police's Riot Squad was present with heavy weaponry.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that on  June  the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT) received a long list of demands from the National Federation of Workers of Post and Telegraph and Similar Enterprises (FENTECT), which included a request for a . per cent wage rise, an increase of over  per cent in real terms. On  August  the enterprise in response proposed that the previous agreement be extended and a wage increase in keeping with the country's economic policy and the labour market, without prejudice to continuing negotiations on this matter. The enterprise subsequently put a new proposal on the negotiating table which granted a  per cent increase for staff occupying the positions of letter carrier, sorter, driver, etc., who make up  per cent of the enterprise's staff, meanwhile maintaining an increase of  per cent for operating staff. The Government indicates that although negotiations were under way, the trade unions affiliated to FENTECT went on strike without justification and in violation of the negotiation process, a strike that as the CUT itself admitted lasted  days. Continuing in the spirit of conciliation, the enterprise received FENTECT on  September  and submitted its final proposal which consisted of maintaining the increase in benefits and supplementing them with a voucher for  reales for each employee.
.The Government indicates that the efforts made by the enterprise to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion were not sufficient for an agreement to be reached. Dissatisfied with the situation and in accordance with the basic rules governing any negotiations, the enterprise had no alternative but to withdraw its proposal and make the resumption of negotiations conditional upon the end of the strike. The enterprise's position was entirely in keeping with the most basic democratic principles given that the strike, as well as not being representative of the wishes of the majority of workers, seriously inconvenienced clients and workers who wanted to work, not to mention the financial losses involved or the negative publicity that a strike entails for the postal service.
.The actions of the trade union organizations concerned were contrary to the legislation concerning strikes, in particular as regards the authorization given by assemblies which cannot declare strike action without giving notice, a requirement which is not met by simply communicating the possibility of strike action in lieu of the requirements and procedures stipulated in Act No. /. The Strike Act provides as follows: ""Article . If negotiations fail or if it is found to be impossible to have recourse to arbitration, a collective work stoppage is permitted. The corresponding employing body or its employees directly involved will be notified a minimum of  hours before the work stoppage. Article . The corresponding trade union organization shall convene, in the manner provided in its by-laws, a general assembly which will define the claims of the category and will discuss the collective stoppage of services. Clause . The by-laws of the trade union organization should make provision for the formalities relating to calling the assembly and the quorum for deliberating, and concerning commencing and ending the strike.""
.Given that this was a strike disapproved of by the enormous majority of workers in the enterprise, the leaders of the trade unions affiliated to the workers' federation, anticipating the fragility of the movement, threatened violent pickets and forced entry into work premises, threats that were confirmed with acts of violence and vandalism in a number of units in the enterprise. In response to this situation the enterprise lodged an application for an injunction. The judicial authorities ordered that the Trade Union of Workers of the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise and Other Similar Enterprises of Ribeirao Preto and Regiao should refrain from any and all activities aimed at restricting or preventing the entry or exit of the public and/or officials to and from the premises of the ECT enterprise, in administrative, operational or service roles, ensuring the right of the workers who want to exercise their activities as usual, and also the general public, the freedom to come and go necessary for the movement of postal traffic. The Government states that entirely ignoring the Strike Act and the injunction, the strikers committed acts of violence and vandalism including damage to",-1,1998,Brazil
57,"public property, offences against employees, enterprise management and users, physical assault against employees and violation of public premises.
.In view of the serious misdemeanours committed, the enterprise, basing itself on the applicable legislation, particularly the Strike Act, dismissed  striking workers with just cause. In view of its clearly illegal acts, on  September  FENTECT found itself obliged to declare the strike over and requested the enterprise to resume negotiations, a request that was quickly complied with. Showing its tolerance and readiness for dialogue, the enterprise increased its offer, including to re-examine within  days, following the signature of the collective agreement, the dismissals carried out during the strike; and to give a basket of basic foodstuffs to the employees who participated in the strike if they returned to work and if the agreement was signed by  September . The trade union representatives rejected the agreement on  October  and in a final attempt to avoid the involvement of the judiciary to settle the matter of the collective dismissal, the enterprise informed FENTECT that it would give it until  October  to decide on the matter, receiving by way of reply the summons to further assemblies to establish the timetable for another strike scheduled for the beginning of December . According to the Government, the claim that the ECT enterprise committed acts in violation of international standards ratified by Brazil is false.
.Regarding the publication of a manual concerning anti-union practices, the Government notes that the manual summarizes a series of guidelines aimed at achieving good relations between employees and employers in the trade union sphere. The Government adds that the manual in question is no longer in use as it has been improved upon and updated by a set of more modern standards.
.The Government also points out that the video referred to by the CUT shows the aggressiveness of the trade union leaders during the  strike, and that the violence cannot be denied because the perpetrators can be clearly seen on the video.
.The Government adds that the allegation whereby at the end of the strike the enterprise began a campaign of reprisals against the strikers and that the authorities engaged in a massive dismissal of the strikers is untrue. According to the Government, this is evidenced by a document signed by the members of the national committee for negotiations between the FENTECT and the ECT, consisting of the minutes of the meeting dated  November  which includes the following entry as regards the collective labour agreement for -: the strikers who were absent from their workstations for over  days during the September strike shall receive, together with the November basket, the basket of basic foodstuffs to which they would have lost their entitlement under usual circumstances, recovering that entitlement by virtue of the agreement between the parties; and the enterprise undertakes to re-examine the dismissals for just cause that took place during the September  strike within a period  days following the signing of the document containing the approval and acceptance of the basis of the collective agreement. As each re-examined dismissal is cancelled, the person concerned will be reinstated. The dismissals that are not rescinded may be re-examined if new facts or unexamined proof appear.
.The Government declares with respect to the allegation that , workers were dismissed, including  trade union leaders, that the enterprise reviewed the dismissals of all the workers dismissed for just cause, which numbered no more than . Of these,  were reinstated, leaving the number of dismissed workers at . Finally, the Government explains that the dismissals mentioned by the CUT (over ,) were contractual rescissions that occurred approximately halfway through , that is, prior to the strike in September .
.The Committee observes that the allegations in this case relate to a collective dispute between the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise and the National Federation of Workers of Post and Telegraph and Similar Enterprises (FENTECT) which led to, during the negotiation of a collective agreement and following the holding of a strike, the massive dismissal of strikers (, workers including, according to the complainant,  trade union leaders or representatives). Also, the Committee notes the complainant's allegations that the enterprise in question: (i) screened a video containing false information relating to the trade union and the strike; (ii) is not allowing the trade union leaders access to the workplace and is placing restrictions on freeing trade union leaders from their professional obligations in order to exercise their trade union activities; and (iii) published a manual on labour relations that contained anti-union provisions.
.As regards the massive dismissal of strikers following a strike against the background of negotiating a collective agreement, the Committee notes the Government's statements that: () despite the fact that negotiations were under way, the trade unions affiliated to FENTECT began unjustified strike action, violating the negotiation process; () the enterprise's efforts to achieve a successful outcome to the negotiations did not prove sufficient for an agreement to be reached and, dissatisfied with the situation and in accordance with the basic rules of any negotiations, the enterprise had no alternative but to withdraw its proposal and make the resumption of negotiations conditional on the strike coming to an end; () the actions of the trade union organizations concerned were contrary to legislation governing strikes, particularly as regards the authorization given by assemblies that cannot declare strike action without giving legal notice, a requirement which is not met by simply communicating the possibility of strike action in lieu of the requirements and procedures stipulated in Act No. /; () the strikers committed acts of violence and vandalism, including damage to public property, offences against employees, enterprise management and users, physical assault against employees and forced entry into public property; () given the serious misdemeanours committed, the enterprise dismissed with just cause  striking workers; () in the framework of the collective agreement for - concluded in November , it was provided that the enterprise would undertake to re-examine the dismissals that occurred during the September  strike within a period of  days from the signature of the document containing the approval and acceptance of the basis for the collective agreement; as each re-examined dismissal was cancelled, the person concerned would be reinstated; and the dismissals that were not rescinded could be re-examined if new facts or unexamined proof appeared; () the enterprise reviewed the dismissals, of which there were no more than , and  of these workers were reinstated, leaving the total number of dismissals at ; and () the dismissals mentioned by the CUT (over ,) concerned contractual rescissions that occurred approximately halfway through , that is, before the strike of September .
.The Committee notes that the Government denies that , dismissals took place, while acknowledging that in the framework of a strike held at the end of September   strikers were dismissed and emphasizing that the trade unions that declared the strike did not respect the legal period of notice and that the dismissed workers committed acts of violence and vandalism, including damage to public property, offences against employees, enterprise management and users, physical assault against employees and forced entry into public property.
.The Committee observes with interest that following the dispute, the parties concluded a collective agreement for - in which the enterprise undertook to re-examine the dismissals, having already reinstated  workers. This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to inform it about the grounds for the dismissals of the  remaining workers.
.Regarding the allegation concerning the screening of a video containing false information about the trade union and the strike by the enterprise's administration, the Committee notes the Government's declaration that the video shows the aggressiveness of the trade union leaders during the strike held in September  and that the violence cannot be denied because the perpetrators can clearly be seen in the film in question. In this respect, the Committee considers in any case that it would not be in a position to determine whether or not the content of the video is a true representation of reality.
.With respect to the publication by the ECT enterprise of a manual on labour relations (forwarded by the complainant) aimed at discrediting the trade unions, the Committee observes that the manual contains provisions relating to disciplinary measures for strikers, involvement of family members of possible strikers, preventive measures in respect of security, etc. The Committee notes the Government's declaration that the manual is no longer in use as it has been replaced by more modern regulations. This being the case, the Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the new labour relations regulations at the ECT enterprise in order to be able to compare them with the previous regulations.
.With reference to the allegation concerning the placing of restrictions on trade union leaders being freed from their professional obligations to exercise their trade union activities, the Committee observes that the Government has not sent its observations on",-1,1998,Brazil
58,"this matter. The Committee also notes that the collective labour agreement for - (the period to which the allegations relate; the Government attaches a copy of the agreement to its reply) made provision in clause , subclauses ,  and  that a certain number of leaders of the trade unions of the enterprise and of FENTECT should be freed from their professional obligations to carry out their trade union activities. This being the case, the Committee stresses the importance it attaches to adherence to the provisions of collective agreements freely negotiated by the parties. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on compliance with such provisions in practice.
.Lastly, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the allegation relating to the impossibility, following the September  strike, for the trade union leaders to have access to the workplace.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the grounds for the dismissal of  workers following the strike held in September  of the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT).(b) The Committee requests the Government to send it a copy of the new labour relations regulations at the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT), in order to compare them with the previous regulations.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations concerning the allegation about the impossibility, following the September  strike at the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise (ECT), for the trade union leaders to have access to the workplace.(d) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on compliance, in practice, with clause , subclauses , , and  of the collective agreement applicable to the ECT enterprise, which relates to time off from work for trade union leaders so that they can carry out their trade union activities.",-1,1998,Brazil

.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  August , the Single Central Organization of Workers (CUT) alleges that, in flagrant violation of the principles of freedom of association, the management of the enterprise Volkswagen do Brazil Ltd. suspended Mr. Renan Cavalcante Santana, a member of the works council, and conducted an inquiry, claiming that he had committed a serious fault. The complainant organization indicates that Mr. Santana had been working in the enterprise for  years and was discharging his second mandate in the works council which had been established on the basis of a collective agreement. According to the complainant organization the enterprise argued that the trade union leader was trying to destabilize internal harmony by criticizing and questioning enterprise decisions in his capacity as trade union leader.
.In its communication dated  October , the Government states that the parties to the dispute, the enterprise Volkswagen do Brazil Ltd. and Mr. Renan Cavalcante Santana, reached a settlement terminating Mr. Santana's contract of employment and regulating other related issues, which was ratified by the fifth Board of Conciliation and Judgement of San Bernardo del Campo. The settlement was concluded freely and spontaneously by the parties; the enterprise undertook to compensate Mr. Santana and to provide him with the instrument rescinding his contract, in order to enable him to withdraw his deposits from the length of service guarantee fund and apply to the competent authority for the unemployment insurance guide and the request for the payment of unemployment insurance. Following the payment of the compensation, the enterprise and the trade union leader would consider the contract of employment to be terminated. Lastly, the Government states that the settlement reached was endorsed by the judicial authorities in order for its legal and regulatory effects to apply. (The Government annexes to its reply a copy of the settlement record concluded by the parties before the Board of Conciliation and of the decision of the Regional Labour Court of the second region of San Pablo.)
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleged the suspension of the trade union leader, Mr. Renan Cavalcante Santana, from the Volkswagen do Brazil Ltd. enterprise for having criticized and questioned enterprise decisions in his capacity as trade union leader.
.The Committee observes the Government's statements that: () the parties to the dispute reached a settlement ratified by the fifth Board of Conciliation and Judgement of San Bernardo del Campo; () the settlement was concluded freely and spontaneously by the parties; () the enterprise undertook to compensate Mr. Santana (, reales) and to provide him with the instrument rescinding his contract, in order to enable him to withdraw his deposits from the length of service guarantee fund and apply to the competent authority for the unemployment insurance guide and the request for the payment of unemployment insurance; and () following the payment of the compensation, the enterprise and the trade union leader would consider the contract of employment to be terminated.
.Given these circumstances, observing that the complainant organization has sent no additional information criticizing the court settlement concluded between the enterprise and the trade union leader, the Committee considers that there is no need to continue with an examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1998,Brazil
60,".The Committee examined this case at its March  meeting (see th Report, paras.  to ), when it insisted that the Government take measures to ensure that the fines imposed on the trade unions of the Single Federation of Oil Workers for their participation in strikes in the PETROBRAS enterprise in  are annulled.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that in its communication dated  September  the Government informs it that Act No. , adopted on  July , cancelled the fines imposed by the Supreme Labour Tribunal on the trade unions of the Single Federation of Oil Workers for their participation in strikes in the PETROBRAS enterprise in .
.However, the Committee once again requests the Government to consult the social partners on the content of Bill No. / (which regulates the imposition of fines in the event of strikes deemed to be abusive or illegal) and hopes that the final text will take into account the results of these consultations and the principles set forth in the conclusions contained in the th Report of the Committee (paras.  to ).
.The complaint was submitted in communications from the Single Confederation of Workers dated  May and  October . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  December  and  January .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), however it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  May and  October , the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT) recalls that in May  the Supreme Labour Tribunal declared abusive (illegal) the strike held within the framework of the collective bargaining process in the PETROBRAS oil company and imposed the working conditions to be respected by the parties (this action was considered by the Committee on Freedom of Association as a violation of the right to strike, bearing in mind the circumstances of the case (see th Report, Case No. , para. ). The CUT adds that following the pursuance of the strike, the Supreme Labour Tribunal imposed on each trade union affiliated to the Single Federation of Oil Workers (FUP) a fine of US$, for each day of strike, which given the duration of the strike made a total of US$ million. This astronomic amount exceeded the payment capacity of the trade unions in question, preventing them from: using the dues paid by their members; fulfilling their economic obligations; paying their employees and carrying out their trade union activities.
.The CUT adds that although the National Congress approved an amnesty law absolving the trade unions from paying the above-mentioned fines, the President of the Republic vetoed this law on  April .
.Furthermore, the CUT alleges that the Government has sent a Bill (/) to the National Congress which amends the Act respecting strikes, in particular as regards essential activities. This Bill limits collective bargaining by authorizing the judiciary to intervene in interest disputes between employers and trade unions, through the exercise of the standard-setting power of the labour courts, by submitting such disputes to a compulsory settlement, and it expressly provides that the judicial authority shall apply fines to trade unions engaging in strikes deemed as ""abusive"", thus regulating the fines already imposed on the trade unions by the courts.
.The CUT objects in particular to the following provisions of the proposed text of Bill No. /:Section Paragraph . In the event that a collective labour dispute which has resulted in a strike is placed before the Tribunal, the President of the Tribunal responsible for its examination may immediately issue a judicial order establishing the conditions and percentage of employees who must remain at work during the stoppage, with a view to complying with the provisions stated at the beginning of this section, and which shall vary in accordance with the nature of the work in the production section in question.Paragraph . The judicial order respecting the unavoidable needs of the community, the infringement of which by any of the parties shall result in a daily fine of up to  minimum wages, shall remain in force:(a) until the date of the ruling on the dispute, if the strike is declared abusive;(b) until the end of the strike movement, if the strike is considered as not abusive.Paragraph . In the event of failure to comply with the order, the legitimate party may, and the Ministry of Labour must, take steps with the Tribunal for the payment of the fine.Section If the strike is declared abusive by the Tribunal, the latter shall order the immediate return to work of the strikers, and warn the trade union that in the event of non-compliance with the decision a daily fine shall be imposed which in any case shall not exceed , minimum wages for each day that the strike movement continues.Paragraph . In determining the amount of the fine, the Tribunal shall take into account the economic and financial capacity of the trade union and the social and economic consequences of non-compliance with the decision.Section If the Tribunal has declared the strike abusive and imposed the fine, it may suspend its payment, in whole or in part, for a period of up to five years, at the request of the interested party or at the request of the Public Ministry of Labour, once the situation has returned to normal.Paragraph . Once the time-limit stipulated at the beginning of this section has elapsed without the trade union organization having engaged in any abusive strike, the competent court may order the cancellation of the fine at the request of the trade union concerned.Paragraph . Proceedings shall be engaged for the full payment of the fine in the event that an abusive strike is held within the time period established at the beginning of this section.Section Trade unions subject to the execution of a fine imposed by judicial decision within the framework of a collective labour dispute which has resulted in a strike may apply to the Tribunal which applied the sanction to request that such fines be adapted to the criteria and limits established in section  and the suspension of the application of the fines under the provisions of section  ...Section This Act shall come into force on the day of its publication.
.Finally, the CUT requests that a recommendation be made to the Government to withdraw the proposed text of Bill No. / and to annul the standard-setting power of the courts in cases of collective labour disputes resulting in strikes since at present such disputes are subject to compulsory settlement.
.In its communications of  December , the Government states that Bill No. /, drafted by the Executive, is the result of the latter's commitment to introduce reforms to modernize the State and its institutions.
.The Government points out that during the strike by workers at the PETROBRAS enterprise in May , the Supreme Labour Tribunal ordered the immediate return of the workers to their workplaces, following its ruling that the strike movement was unlawful, since it violated the standards in force respecting collective labour disputes, non-compliance with which would be subject to the payment of a fine of , reales per day by each member of the Single Federation of Oil Workers (FUP), which represented the workers. The imposition of this fine by the labour court, given the refusal of the workers to return to their workplaces, was intended to put an end to a strike movement which lasted a month and during which the civilian population suffered a shortage of fuel and cooking gas because of the non-maintenance of a minimum level of essential services.
.Following the application of the ruling made by the labour court, a number of representative trade union bodies of the workers of the enterprise which disregarded the ruling claimed that it compromised their financial situation.
.Bill No.  (placed before the National Congress by the Government following the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association in Case No. ) granted an amnesty to the oil workers' trade unions in respect of the fines imposed by the labour courts following the strike movement of May . After the Bill had been adopted by the National Congress, it was vetoed by the President of the Republic as being contrary to the public interest and to the respect of legal standards and judicial decisions. The precedent which would be created by the adoption of the above-mentioned Bill would have resulted in discrediting the legitimacy of the principles governing a democratic State based on the rule of law and called into question the harmonization of the powers of the State as established by the Constitution, which would be compromised by the disregard of decisions consistently adopted by the judiciary.
.In vetoing the above-mentioned Bill, the President of the Republic presented another Bill (No. /) which regulates more precisely the consequences of the abusive exercise of the right to strike, by establishing parameters for determining with greater legal clarity the responsibility",-1,1996,Brazil
61,"of unions which promote work stoppages considered as abusive, particularly in those branches which provide the general public with essential services, in accordance with Act No. /. The President's message tacitly acknowledged the excessive nature of the sanction imposed by the Supreme Labour Tribunal by emphasizing that the Executive is not indifferent to the fact that trade union activity by the oil workers may not be possible as a result of the high amount of the fines imposed.
.Bill No. / provided for a possible solution to the specific question of the fines imposed on the trade unions of workers of PETROBRAS and other trade unions by establishing parameters which must be respected by the labour courts in the fixing of fines, their payment and the possibility of suspending the application of such fines.
.The Bill took account of the situation of an occupational category which, following the application of a fine imposed under a judicial ruling which declared a strike abusive, made the exercise of trade union activity in a specific production sector unviable by providing that any trade union subject to such an order could under the Bill apply to the court which imposed the order for the sanctions to be adjusted and/or the payment of the fines to be suspended, in accordance with the economic capacity of the trade unions. This provision preserves the independence of and harmony between the powers of the Republic, which would have been seriously compromised if the National Congress had withdrawn from the Supreme Labour Tribunal its authority respecting the application of fines imposed as a result of the strike movement of May .
.Bill No. / introduces into Act No. / (Act respecting strikes) certain practices which had already been adopted by the labour courts as regards the fixing of minimum percentages of staff who must remain at work and the conditions in which indispensable services are to be provided to meet the essential needs of the public in the event of strikes in essential services, and the imposition of fines and their application by the Public Ministry of Labour. In this way, the Bill before the National Congress is an attempt to promote a return to normal conditions in labour and trade union relations in the oil sector (including through the possible retroactive application of the provisions of the Bill) and goes beyond these immediate objectives by regulating more precisely the exercise of the right to strike guaranteed by the Constitution. The Bill offers a broader solution at the standard-setting level to the matter dealt with in the Bill vetoed by the President concerning the amnesty granted in respect of fines imposed on various trade union bodies by the Supreme Labour Tribunal.
.Although immunity with respect to the abuses committed on the pretext of the right to strike is contrary to the Constitution, the competence of the labour courts should nevertheless be circumscribed by legal parameters concerning the imposition of pecuniary sanctions on trade union bodies. The Bill provides for its full application to fines imposed before its publication. This is also the case as regards the limitation on the amount of the fine and the suspension of its application. This innovation allows the pecuniary sanction to be lifted once the industrial relations situation has returned to normal.
.In its communication of  January , the Government indicates that the trade union organization's reference to the standard-stetting power of the labour courts as an instrument used against the workers is without basis. Consideration must be given to the nature of the collective disputes submitted to the assessment of the courts, determined as collective disputes, to which the workers, employers (and the public ministry in cases of the paralysis of essential activities) may have recourse and which require the assistance of the State to resolve those collective disputes where agreement or conciliation seems totally or partially impossible. The federal Constitution grants the labour courts the standard-setting power in order to establish rules and working conditions in the judgement of collective disputes, setting new conditions or working rules and respecting the limits imposed by the Constitution and the laws of the land. This is a result of the principle of jurisdiction which is a way of resolving conflicts through the intervention of the State in the judicial process where the concrete right is established, dictating to the parties the legal solution to the dispute. The standard-setting power should be interpreted in accordance with democratic principles (article ), separation of powers (articles  and ) and legality (article  II), all of which are provided for in the federal Constitution. As concerns strikes in cases where a collective rights dispute has been declared, or when submitted to the judiciary, it must be determined whether the strike is or is not abusive. Where a strike has been declared abusive taking into account the violation of the provisions of Act No. / sanctions are provided where the workers have not returned to the workplace and recommenced negotiations.
.The Government adds that the standard-setting power, contrary to what was said by the complainant organization, has limits established in the federal Constitution. When the labour courts exercise this standard-setting power it has executed an exclusively judicial activity. When judging collective disputes, existing standards in positive law must be observed, thus the courts are exercising jurisdictional power given that they are applying a legal order. The limits established by the Constitution prohibit the judiciary from exercising a legislative activity due to the principle of the separation of powers. When exercising the standard-setting power, it must assure private property, the equality of rights, the social function of private property, the objective of full employment, free enterprise, the value of human work and the dictates of social justice. The standard-setting power is exercised within the limits of the law, given that no one is required to do or not to do any act by virtue of the law (article  II). This means that the standard-setting power cannot be exercised if there is no legal provision for it. In this way, the standard-setting power cannot touch upon matters not provided for in the law. The standard-setting power establishes rules through a judgement dictated by a competent body, in the present case, the section on collective disputes of the Supreme Labour Tribunal, composed of lawyers and representatives of workers and of employers. Similarly, the standard-setting power enables the establishment of applicable standards according to which the competent body will determine the qualification of a strike, in the present case, part of the section of collective disputes, which includes among its members representatives of workers, of employers and lawyers.
.Like all draft legislation, Bill No. / may be subject to amendments during its passage through the committees of the National Congress. It is the responsibility of society, as represented by the National Congress, to decide upon its appropriateness, adaptation and timeliness, by introducing amendments considered necessary for its adoption and subsequent submission to presidential approval.
.In this case, the complainant organization alleges the imposition of fines on trade unions affiliated to the Single Federation of Oil Workers (FUP) participating in strikes in the PETROBRAS enterprise in  and which exceeded the payment capacity of the trade unions; the veto by the President of the Republic of an Act (No. ) adopted by the National Congress which granted an amnesty in respect of these fines; the presentation of a Bill (No. /) which regulates the imposition of fines for strikes deemed abusive or illegal by the judicial authority and which, according to the complainant, contains provisions which are contrary to freedom of association and which subject collective disputes of interest to the judicial authority.
.As regards the fines imposed by the judicial authority on the trade unions affiliated to the Single Federation of Oil Workers (FUP) following the strikes held in the PETROBRAS enterprise in  after a compulsory judicial settlement, the Committee notes that the total amount of the fines is very high and that the Government recognizes that this high amount may make the trade union activity of the workers impossible. The Committee would like to refer to the conclusions which, within the framework of Case No. , it reached at its meeting of November  concerning this labour dispute and strike of oil workers and the submission of disputes to the judicial authority, which are reproduced below (see th Report, paras.  and ):With regard to the violation of the principle of collective bargaining in the dispute under examination, the Committee observes that according to the complainant the strike commenced on  September  pursuant to the enterprise's rejection of the union's main demands and that the Government states that three days later, on  September , the Supreme Labour Tribunal established the working conditions to be respected by the parties (and, as a consequence, the workers on strike were to return to work immediately as required by legislation). The Government also declared that subsequently, on  May , the enterprise submitted the collective dispute to the Supreme Labour",-1,1996,Brazil
62,"Tribunal. Moreover, the complainant indicated in this context that neither the Government nor PETROBRAS had respected the terms of the relevant agreements (appended to the complaint) that they had signed with the Single Federation of Oil Workers on  and  November  (the latter agreement was subsequently to be termed by the Supreme Labour Tribunal as a ""protocol of intent"" and declared legally invalid). Irrespective of these texts, the Committee must emphasize that, three days after the strike broke out and as the movement was continuing, the Supreme Labour Tribunal imposed working conditions to be respected by the parties thus rendering the strike activity illegal. On this score, the Committee wishes to recall the principle that ""a provision which commits either party unilaterally to request the intervention of the labour authority may effectively undermine the right of workers to call a strike ... and does not promote voluntary collective bargaining"" (cf. th Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Peru), para. , and th Report, Case No.  (Philippines), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the action taken violated the right to strike. It requests the Government to take measures to amend legislation so that the submission of collective interest disputes to the judicial authorities is only possible by common agreement between the parties or in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (the interruption of which may endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).Moreover, the Committee urges the Government to guarantee that collective agreements between management and unions be respected. It also requests the Government to encourage the social partners to resolve collective disputes by means of collective bargaining.
.The Committee recalls that, in this case, it had concluded that the Government acted in violation of the principles of freedom of association by putting an end to the strike in the PETROBRAS enterprise. In these circumstances, the Committee concludes that the imposition of fines for the exercise of the right to strike in the circumstances of the present case is not consistent with the principle of freedom of association, in particular bearing in mind that the Government recognizes that the high amount of the fines may make trade union activity impossible. The Committee stresses that no fine or sanction should be imposed against the unionists in question. The Committee also notes that, in line with the previous recommendations of the Committee, the Government presented a Bill (No. ) to the National Congress which granted an amnesty in respect of the fines (subsequently vetoed by the President of the Republic who invoked the respect of the decisions of the judiciary and the protection of the principles of a democratic State based on the rule of law). The Committee insists that the Government take the necessary measures to ensure that these fines are annulled. Furthermore, the Committee notes the Government's statement concerning the circumstances in which the standard-setting power of the labour courts would be exercised. In the Committee's opinion, this procedure is not incompatible with the principles of freedom of association to the extent that it concerns essential services in the strict sense of the term. The Committee reiterates the request already made at its meeting of November  for the Government to take measures to amend legislation to ensure that the submission of collective interest disputes to the judicial authorities is only possible by common agreement between the parties or in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (the interruption of which may endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).
.As regards Bill No. / which regulates and establishes criteria concerning the imposition of fines in the event of abusive or legal strikes, which the Executive sent to the National Congress, the Committee notes that according to the Government the Bill establishes parameters for determining with greater legal clarity responsibilities in the case of abusive stoppages in the essential services mentioned in the legislation, in particular bearing in mind that the high amount of the fines imposed by the judicial authorities might make trade union activity impossible. The Committee also notes that in the light of the resulting situation, the Bill provides that fines may be adjusted in accordance with the economic capacity of the trade unions and may be suspended and cancelled after five years if the trade union body has not carried out any other abusive strike (for example, failure to comply with the provision respecting minimum services).
.The Committee would like to emphasize that the imposition of sanctions, including fines, on the social partners in the case of infringement of labour legislation is not in itself a matter of objection; however, such sanctions must be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement committed and must in no case compromise the continuation of the activities of the parties thus sanctioned. Similarly, the Bill should not provide for fines or sanctions in cases of legitimate strike action. In this respect, the Committee believes that fines which are equivalent to a maximum amount of  or , minimum wages per day of abusive strike may have an intimidating effect on trade unions and inhibit their legitimate trade union activities, and that such an effect would also occur if - as is also provided for in this Bill - the cancellation of a fine of this kind is subject to the provision that no further strike considered as abusive is carried out. For this reason, the Committee requests the Government to consult with the social partners on the content of Bill No. / and hopes that the results of these consultations and the above-mentioned principles will be taken into account in the final text of the Act.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee insists that the Government take measures to ensure that the fines imposed on the trade unions of the Single Federation of Oil Workers (FUP) for their participation in strikes in the PETROBRAS enterprise in  are annulled.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that the Bill which is presently being examined by the National Congress does not provide for fines or sanctions in the case of legitimate strike action. In this respect, considering that some provisions of Bill No. / may have an intimidating effect on trade unions and inhibit their legitimate trade union activities, the Committee requests the Government to consult with the social partners on the content of Bill No. / and hopes that the final text will take into account the results of these consultations and the principles set forth in the conclusions.(c) The Committee once again requests the Government to take measures to amend the legislation so that the submission of collective interest disputes to the judicial authorities is only possible by common agreement between the parties or in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (the interruption of which may endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).",-1,1996,Brazil
63,".The complaint was sent in a communication from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  February . The WFTU sent additional information in a communication dated  March . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications dated  February and  March , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) alleges that its affiliate, the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) of Brazil, is suffering anti-union discrimination at the hands of the Government, which has excluded it from the country's tripartite bodies (the Social Security and Health Council, the Length of Service Guarantee Fund Council and other tripartite bodies in which the other trade union confederations participate). In addition it has not included CGT representatives among the delegates to sessions of the International Labour Conference, inclusive of the rd Session () in which the CGT should have legitimately participated as official workers' delegate in keeping with the established order of rotation.
.The WFTU explains that the CGT was established in , that it represents over  million members, and to date has held three national congresses. The third of these took place in September  in Sao Paulo, with the participation of  national trade union organizations (trade unions, federations and confederations), and international trade union delegations from  countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America which participated as observers. In addition, representatives of the Brazilian authorities, Parliament and political parties were present at the opening of the third congress.
.The WFTU adds that the CGT is a third-level representative organization, made up of first and second-level trade union bodies, which carries out considerable activities in Brazil through various social programmes such as: (a) food programmes; (b) health programmes and AIDS prevention programmes; (c) literacy programmes and skills-enhancement programmes for workers. These activities are governed by an agreement with the Ministry of Education and Culture and are supported by individual states. The project contributed to the training of over , workers in , and , in ; (d) other CGT activities have been recognized and acclaimed by various social institutions.
.In its communication of  May  the Government explains that the State of Brazil does not interfere in the nomination of workers' representatives, the membership of tripartite councils or the composition of delegations to sessions of the International Labour Conference or other international tripartite technical meetings.
.The Government adds that attempts to include the General Confederation of Workers among the organizations invited to designate a representative was categorically refused by the other Brazilian trade union confederations. The Government attaches a letter from these three confederations opposing the nomination of a CGT representative as a delegate to the th Session of the International Labour Conference () which states that ""everyone is aware that it does not fulfil any of the representation criteria"". The Government concludes by saying that it is complying with article , paragraph , of the ILO Constitution and that it carries out consultations with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations and nominates delegates to the International Labour Conference in agreement with such organizations.
.With regard to the matter of not nominating a representative of the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) as a member of the Brazilian delegation to the International Labour Conference, the Committee recalls that: ""The question of representation at the International Labour Conference falls within the competence of the Conference Credentials Committee"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ). The Committee also wishes to refer to the conclusions presented by the Credentials Committee in , following an objection by the General Confederation of Workers, which are quoted below:The Committee wishes to point out that it is the duty of the Government to take all reasonable steps to evaluate the representative character of the different organizations in accordance with international law and practice and that the Government had an obligation to consult all the most representative organizations pursuant to article , paragraph , of the ILO Constitution. However, since the objecting organization had not provided any evidence in support of its objection, the Committee decided not to uphold it. (See International Labour Conference, Provisional Record B, rd Session, Geneva, .)
.As for the exclusion of the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) from the country's tripartite bodies, the Committee notes the Government's general statement that the State does not interfere in the nomination of workers to be included in tripartite councils, and its reference to the opinion of the other three national confederations which maintain that the CGT does not fulfil any of the representation criteria; the complainant organization has however indicated that the CGT represents over  million members and that at its most recent congress  trade union organizations participated (trade unions, federations and confederations). The Committee concludes that the CGT's view of the extent of its representation is not shared by the other three confederations, or, and here the facts speak for themselves, by the Government (which has excluded it from national tripartite bodies). The Committee recalls that ""it was not called upon to express an opinion as to the right of a particular organization to be invited to take part in joint or consultative bodies unless its exclusion constituted a clear case of discrimination affecting the principle of freedom of association"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). However, the Committee stresses the principle whereby ""The determination of the most representative trade union should always be based on objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunity for partiality or abuse"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). As neither the Government nor the complainant has indicated the level of representation of the General Confederation of Workers with respect to the other trade union confederations, or whether any legal procedures exist to determine the representation of existing trade union confederations, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that decisions relating to the composition of national tripartite bodies take this principle duly into account.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to ensure that decisions relating to the composition of national tripartite bodies take into account the principle whereby the determination of the most representative trade union should always be based on objective and pre-established criteria so as to avoid any opportunity for partiality or abuse.",-1,1996,Brazil
64,".The complaint referred to in the present case is contained in a communication from the National Federation of Post, Telegraph and Assimilated Enterprise Workers (FENTECT) dated  December . Subsequently, FENTECT submitted additional information on this matter in its communication of  February . The Government sent its comments on these matters in a communication dated  March .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  December  and  February , the National Federation of Post, Telegraph and Assimilated Enterprise Workers (FENTECT) alleges that the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise has violated the right to strike recognized in the Brazilian federal Constitution. The complainant organization explains that the closing date for completion of bargaining in the sector has been set at  December of each year so as to avoid strikes being launched in the period around Christmas and the year end when there is a large volume of work. The complainant organization also adds that it attempted to start the bargaining a month before the closing date but that the undertaking refused to negotiate for a considerable period of time until, through the intervention of the Labour Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, it accepted to commence discussions and set the first meeting for  November , i.e. seven days before the closing date for completion of negotiations. The complainant organization states that the undertaking not only delayed the bargaining so that any strike (that might take place) would occur during the month of December but also used the press to turn public opinion against the workers, with the intention of showing that any strike implemented during this period was due to a decision taken by the workers.
.The complainant organization states that the undertaking was lacking in honesty and good faith and that it carried out anti-trade union acts. First, the complainant alleges that, on  December , the undertaking arranged publication in the major national and regional newspapers of a press release stating that, should a strike be launched, it would hire temporary workers to take the place of the striking workers; this is contrary to the Brazilian Strikes Act (section ) which prohibits the hiring of workers to replace those that are on strike (the complainant appends an original of this communication to its complaint). The strike finally started on  December. Secondly, the complainant organization declares that the undertaking published in its News Bulletin, on  December , untrue information that the President of the Superior Labour Court had ruled the immediate and total ending of the strike, whereas, in fact, the Court's decision was aimed at ensuring that a minimum service was maintained solely for telecommunications.
.Finally, the complainant organization declares that, in certain areas, the undertaking's regional managements summoned an excessively large number of workers back to their posts so as to guarantee a minimum service, including outside the telecommunications sector, claiming falsely that this summons had been ordered by the Superior Labour Court.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that, in presenting its complaint, the complainant organization has refrained from submitting information of vital importance, and declares in particular that, over a period of  months, the complainant organization has launched five strikes, all of which were irregular; in particular, the latest strike, called on  December , was qualified as ""abusive"" by the Superior Labour Court on  December . The Government adds that: the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise employs a total of , workers and that the number of workers taking part in the strike called by the complainant organization was insignificant; that the strike held in December  was called by only  trade unions and that the other  trade unions in question preferred not to take part in the strike. The Government states that, historically, all the strikes in the sector have been called by a minority of trade union leaders who are not prepared to coexist democratically.
.As concerns the allegation about excessive delays on the part of the undertaking in commencing the bargaining process, the Government declares that: the deadline for completion of bargaining was changed (from  January to  December of each year) with the express authorization of the Ministry for State Undertaking Coordination on the basis of an agreement between the undertaking and the workers' representatives with a view to improving workers' pay conditions; that it is not certain that this occurred as the consequence of a strike having been held; and that the setting of  December as the deadline was favourable to the workers since they were able to put pressure on the undertaking by calling strikes in a month in which the community as a whole has urgent need of the postal system. Likewise, the Government denies that there was a premeditated delay in the start-up of bargaining. In particular, the Government states that bargaining started as soon as the undertaking had received the extensive demands made and had presented them to the competent financial supervisory bodies. The Government points out that, in view of the complexity of the demands, and the need to obtain guidance from the competent financial supervisory bodies, the undertaking found itself obliged to set a negotiation timetable, drawn up and discussed together with the complainant organization, which would not prejudice the bargaining process, so that once the process had been launched it would progress rapidly and under normal conditions. The Government points out that it would not be reasonable for the undertaking to come to an agreement with the trade unions without the prior consent of the competent financial supervisory bodies and the complainant organization was well aware of this procedure.
.The Government adds that, contrary to what had been stated by the complainant organization, the undertaking had taken, as from  June , the measures required to finalize the negotiations with a view to drawing up a collective agreement for the period from  December  to  November  (in its reply, the Government appends a timetable indicating that the undertaking started discussions to commence bargaining on  June , that it invited the complainant organization to submit its demands on  September  and that the complainant organization did not submit its demands until the end of September ). The Government adds: that in view of its enormous responsibility to society, the undertaking cannot accept the whims and fancies of the complainant organization by accepting without reservation the demands put forward, including a wage increase of  per cent; and that, since the undertaking did not grant the requested increase, a minority decided to call a strike. The Government declares that this showed that the complainant organization had no intention of bargaining; instead, it planned only to force a situation in its favour so as to leave the negotiating table in spite of a number of specific proposals put forward by the undertaking.
.In relation to the allegation that, through certain publications, the undertaking committed anti-trade union acts, the Government states that these were administrative measures taken on account of the institution's responsibility for the mail services, with the intention of reassuring the population that efforts would be made to maintain the regularity of postal services. The Government declares: that the postal services published an announcement for the population at large stating it had bolstered its work force to deal with the large volume of mail typically processed in the end-of-year season; that the hiring of temporary workers was something that occurred each year; and that this could not be considered a reprisal against the trade unions since no dismissals took place in spite of the strike. The Government points out that, each year, the undertaking draws up a special operating programme for the months of November and December, providing for emergency transfer of workers from the administrative services to the operational services, and that the complainant organization is well aware of the operational difficulties entailed by the increase in postal service volume. The Government emphasizes that the strike was not what instigated the temporary worker hiring programme, it was only a complicating factor. Furthermore, the Government points out that legal action was taken before the Superior Labour Court and that this Court declared the strike to be abusive (the Government appends to its response a copy of the Court's findings dated  December  in which is stated that the strike is ""abusive"" with the consequence that there is no obligation to pay wages for the days of strike).
.With respect to the allegation that the undertaking summoned an excessive number of striking workers, requiring that they resume work in order to maintain a minimum service, distorting the meaning of the measure stipulated by the Superior Labour Court, the Government states that, in specifying the term ""telecommunications"", the Court had the intention of covering all the undertaking's activities and that the",-1,1995,Brazil
65,"summonses requiring workers to resume work were the direct outcome of the Court's decision (the Government provides a transcription of the Superior Labour Court's findings in which it states that ""... The current legislation on strikes defines telecommunications as an essential activity and that there was not the slightest indication in the proceedings that the strikers had observed the relevant requirement in the Strike Act by endeavouring, in conjunction with the undertaking, to guarantee, for the duration of the strike, the provision of essential services to meet the basic needs of the community. In virtue of the above: () (the Court) decided that the staff members of the professional category represented by the Federation in question and by the trade unions and their members, should immediately stop their total paralysis of the telecommunications services, and should endeavour to keep at work the percentage of workers required to meet the essential needs of the community ... () It also decided that, to the protect the interests of the community, the undertaking should immediately summon to work, by name, a sufficient number of workers from headquarters and various agencies to faithfully implement the decisions taken under the previous item ..."" Finally, the Government adds that the complainant organization has not presented evidence to support the allegations that an excessively large number of workers were summoned to resume work and that, in this respect, if the complainant organization considers that an unlawful act has been committed, it should appeal to the Superior Labour Court.
.The Committee notes that, in the present case, the complainant organization alleges that the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise has committed anti-trade union acts within the framework of a collective dispute (delays in the negotiation of a collective agreement, temporary hiring of workers when confronted with a strike and the summonsing of an excessively large number of workers to provide a minimum service).
.With respect to the allegation that the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise imposed excessive delays in negotiating a collective agreement, the Committee observes that the versions presented by the complainant organization and the Government are contradictory. Consequently, the Committee is not in a position to decide whether there was a delay attributable to the undertaking at the start of bargaining, or, as is affirmed by the Government, the undertaking is not responsible for the delays but rather that these are due to the fact that the complainant organization did not seek to negotiate (in this regard, the Government appends a timetable which indicates that the undertaking started negotiation proceedings on  June , that it invited the complainant organization to submit its demands on  September  and that the complainant organization presented its demands only at the end of September of the same year). In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall that, in similar situations, it has considered that ""the principle that both employers and trade unions must negotiate in good faith and make efforts to arrive at an agreement, supposes avoiding any unjustified delay in the process of negotiation"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, th edition, , para. ).
.With respect to the allegation about the publication of a press release in newspapers by the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise on  December  stating that it had hired workers on account of a strike, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) these were administrative measures taken to fulfil the postal service's responsibilities, with a view to reassuring the population about efforts to maintain the regularity of the mail services; (ii) the hiring of temporary labour is something that occurs each year and it cannot be considered as an anti-trade union reprisal, since no dismissals took place in spite of the strike; (iii) each year, the undertaking draws up a special operating programme for the months of November and December, involving the emergency transfer of workers from the administrative sector to the operational sector; and (iv) the strike was not the causative factor for the temporary worker hiring programme, but only a complicating factor.
.The Committee notes however that the text of the press release, the original of which is appended by the complainant organization to its complaint, states as follows:Information of public interest. The Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise gives notice that it has taken adequate and firm action to guarantee the provision of basic services to the population in view of the announced likelihood of a strike being called by various postal service workers' unions, and in view of the increase in postal traffic common during the end-of-year period. In this way, at the first sign of paralysis, it will put into effect the following contingency plan: hiring of temporary workers, in sufficient numbers ... Brasilia,  December .
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the right to strike is recognized by the legislation for the sector in question and that the Government states that the hiring of workers during the period November-December is a normal practice; however, it should be pointed out that the press release announcing that workers would be hired in the event a strike took place was published a day before the strike was called and the bargaining had been completed. In this context, the Committee regrets that this press release can be interpreted as a threat to weaken the trade union's means of action and the impact of the strike, especially when one takes into account that this press release predates the declaration of the Superior Labour Court ordering maintenance of a minimum service ( December ) and the declaration of the same Court as to the abusive nature of the strike, meaning that there is no obligation to pay the strikers' wages ( December ). Under these circumstances, the Committee deplores the publication of the release in question, given that the hiring of workers could be justified only if the strikers did not maintain, for the duration of the strike, the minimum service laid down in the legislation. The Committee calls on the Government to take steps to ensure that, in the future, the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise does not have recourse to the hiring of temporary workers to replace strikers.
.Finally, with regard to the allegation that far too many striking workers were summoned to return to work so as to provide a minimum service, the Committee notes that the Government declares that: () the Superior Labour Court ordered that the percentage of workers necessary for meeting the community's essential needs should be kept at work; () the same Court also ordered the undertaking to summon to work a sufficient number of workers from the headquarters and various agencies to adequately implement the requirements of the preceding item; () the claimant organization has not submitted evidence to support the allegation that too many workers were summoned to resume work; and () if the claimant organization considers that an unlawful act has been committed, it should appeal to the Superior Labour Court.
.While the Committee considers that a minimum service may be established in the post and telecommunications sector in the event of a strike, it must emphasize that workers' and employers' organizations should participate in the determination of the extent of such a minimum service. There was no evidence of this in the present case.
.In any event, the Committee is not in a position to determine whether the stipulated minimum service was or was not excessive. The Committee has pointed out on previous occasions that ""a definitive pronouncement on the basis of all factors of appreciation on whether the level of minimum services was or was not essential can be decided only by the judicial authority; this in any case supposes in particular an in-depth knowledge of the structure and operation of the undertakings and establishments concerned and of the effective impact of the strike actions"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). Along these lines, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union could have appealed to the Superior Labour Court that the number of workers called in to provide a minimum service was excessive.
.In light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee calls on the Government to take measures to ensure that, in future, the Brazilian Post and Telegraph Enterprise does not have recourse to hiring temporary workers to replace strikers.(b) Where it is necessary to establish a minimum service, the Committee requests the Government to take into account the principle according to which workers' and employers' organizations should participate in the determination of the extent of minimum services to be maintained in the event of a strike.",-1,1995,Brazil
66,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT) dated  May . The Government sent its comments in a letter dated  September .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), however it has ratified the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May  the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT) explains that in Brazil oil drilling, refinery and distillation are conducted by Petrobrs which holds a state monopoly and is the largest Brazilian public enterprise. Petrobrs employs approximately , workers organized in  trade unions and a national federation, the Single Federation of Oil Workers (FUP), affiliated to the CUT. The date set each year for collective bargaining between these workers, represented by the CUT and Petrobrs management is  September.
.The complainant adds that the  bargaining round began in August and continued into September during which time the enterprise constantly rejected the trade unions' principal demands (wage increases in line with inflation;  per cent productivity; monthly wage indexation; payment of unpaid wages; public competitions to fill vacant jobs, etc.). As the negotiating process was in deadlock, the union meetings approved a strike of indefinite duration to commence on  September. On  September, the Supreme Labour Tribunal declared the strike abusive (illegal) and withdrew some of the acquired rights enjoyed by this category of workers, e.g. guaranteed employment and leave for trade union leaders. The unions called a meeting at which it was decided that the oil workers would continue their strike action. On  October, at the request of the FUP and the President of the CUT, talks took place with the President of the Republic and the Ministers of Finance, of Labour and of Mines and Energy; an agreement was signed stipulating that Petrobrs would resume negotiations, wage losses would be discussed, strikers would not be dismissed or the subject of sanctions and a committee would be established to discuss loans for workers, the payment of overtime and the collective agreement's social clauses. The strike action was halted.
.The complainant indicates that in October and November Petrobrs management refused to comply with the terms of this agreement and instituted administrative proceedings against strikers in Minas Gerais, Baha and Feara. On  November, given the threat of renewed industrial action, further talks were held leading to an agreement (forwarded by the complainant in an appendix) between the FUP and the Ministers of Labour and Mines; this envisaged the payment of two additional wage bonuses to workers, an amnesty for trade union leaders penalized for industrial action, the right of defence for all oil workers threatened with sanctions and, lastly, the maintenance of guaranteed employment and the collective agreement's other social clauses.
.On  November, the Government revoked the agreement and, consequently, the strike action was resumed. On the same day, the Supreme Labour Tribunal held a new hearing at which Petrobrs proposed a conciliation agreement guaranteeing a review of the enterprise's wage levels; this was intended to result in a readjustment of the wage scales by  to  per cent. The oil workers accepted the proposal (the complainant forwarded a copy of the protocol) and halted the strike. Nevertheless, in December, arguing that the Government had not given its authorization, Petrobrs refused to apply the agreement that had been signed.
.From January to April, the FUP continued to demand that the enterprise comply with the agreement concluded; faced with a negative response, union meetings approved renewed strike action. On  May, a nationwide strike of oil workers began; they demanded the implementation of the agreement signed on  November , a  per cent wage adjustment, the reinstatement of those dismissed during the Collor period, the return to previous manning strengths in the enterprise and the payment of loans to workers. On  May, the Supreme Labour Tribunal declared the strike abusive, arguing that the November-December  agreement was legally null and void and that, consequently, there were no grounds for strike action. On  May and on the basis of a decision pronounced by the President of the Republic, Petrobrs began to dismiss enterprise officials including various trade unionists and maintained that it had legitimate grounds to do so. By  May,  employees, amongst whom were leaders of the trade unions and of the federation, had been dismissed. The strike continued with the trade unions guaranteeing maintenance of plant and equipment as well as  per cent of gas production for hospital, industrial and domestic supplies.
.In the CUT leadership's opinion, the measures adopted by the Brazilian Government are in flagrant violation of the national Constitution and of ILO Convention No.  ratified by Brazil. The relevant text in the Constitution stipulates specifically that trade union leaders may only be dismissed if they are proved guilty of an offence or serious misconduct. Moreover, the complainant emphasizes that the Supreme Labour Tribunal declared the collective agreement (of  November ) null and void given that it was concluded outside the dates set for the bargaining process and that it had not been signed by the enterprise. As indicated above, this agreement was, however, signed by two Government Ministers and, consequently, by authorities hierarchically superior to the Petrobrs management - their subordinates. The Executive disregards and rejects the document negotiated and signed by the former administration of which the present President of the Republic was a member.
.In its communication dated  September , the Government confirms that Petrobrs S.A. is the largest Brazilian public enterprise and that it holds a state monopoly in oil drilling, refinery, distillation and product distribution; that it employs approximately , employees organized in  trade unions and a national federation, the Single Federation of Oil Workers (FUP), affiliated to the Single Confederation of Workers (CUT).
.The Government adds that the sequence of events in the negotiations between the enterprise and the workers was as follows:- August : commencement of bargaining to renew the collective agreement without the parties coming to an understanding;
.In the event of the failure of collective bargaining, the parties shall be entitled to elect arbitrators.
.If one of the parties refuses negotiations or arbitration, the respective trade unions shall be authorized to submit the collective dispute to the judiciary which shall be empowered to set certain standards and conditions in compliance with the provisions of law and the minimum legal requirements in respect of social protection.The Government adds that the Tribunal, in its ruling ( September ), also established the working conditions to be respected by the parties up until the next date for bargaining, i.e. August . Given the Tribunal's decision, the relevant category of employees should have returned to work forthwith, in accordance with the Strike Act (No. /). In spite of this judicial ruling, the oil workers continued their strike action in the absence of any agreement:
.-  May : the enterprise took legal action to submit the collective dispute to the Supreme Labour Tribunal with a view to obtaining a ruling declaring the strike illegal on the grounds that a collective standard set by the Tribunal was in force, that its terms were being met - all of which rendered the strike abusive according to Act No. /The Tribunal, after examining the enterprise's arguments, judged the strike to be abusive, declared the Protocol of Intent legally invalid and ordered the employees' return to work.
.The judicial proceedings with a view to the strike being declared abusive were conducted in accordance with the terms of the Federal Constitution and Act No. /. The relevant category of workers made full use of their right of defence always guaranteed to the parties in dispute in democratic systems. As the strike was declared abusive, the enterprise was permitted, in accordance with law, to dismiss and replace workers on strike in order to ensure both the enforcement of the ruling and respect for the rule of law. It was also incumbent on the enterprise to safeguard community supplies of essential products such as fuels and cooking gas; shortages of these were now affecting the entire population and undermining national security. In order to guarantee such supplies it was necessary to dismiss and replace some workers persisting in their strike action once the movement had been declared illegal. The Government sent court sentences of  and  May .
.The Committee observes that in this complaint the complainant organization alleges: () violation of the principle of collective bargaining (established in Convention No. ) in the Brazilian petroleum sector during the collective dispute (September -May ) arising from negotiations on an agreement between oil workers and Petrobrs S.A. (state monopoly); () that as a result of the strikes held in the course of this collective dispute  strikers were dismissed (both unionists and trade union leaders).
.With regard to the violation of the principle of collective bargaining in the dispute under examination, the Committee observes that according to the complainant the strike commenced on ",-1,1995,Brazil
67,"September  pursuant to the enterprise's rejection of the unions' main demands and that the Government states that three days later, on  September , the Supreme Labour Tribunal established the working conditions to be respected by the parties (and, as a consequence, the workers on strike were to return to work immediately as required by legislation). The Government also declared that subsequently, on  May , the enterprise submitted the collective dispute to the Supreme Labour Tribunal. Moreover, the complainant indicated in this context that neither the Government nor Petrobrs had respected the terms of the relevant agreements (appended to the complaint) that they had signed with the Single Federation of Oil Workers on  and  November  (the latter agreement was subsequently to be termed by the Supreme Labour Tribunal as a ""Protocol of Intent"" and declared legally invalid). Irrespective of these texts, the Committee must emphasize that, three days after the strike broke out and as the movement was continuing, the Supreme Labour Tribunal imposed working conditions to be respected by the parties thus rendering the strike activity illegal. On this score, the Committee wishes to recall the principle that ""a provision which permits either party unilaterally to request the intervention of the labour authority may effectively undermine the right of workers to call a strike ... and does not promote voluntary collective bargaining"" (cf. th Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Peru), para. , and th Report, Case No.  (Philippines), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the action taken violated the right to strike. It requests the Government to take measures to amend legislation so that the submission of collective interest disputes to the judicial authorities is only possible by common agreement between the parties or in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (the interruption of which may endanger the life, personal safety or health of all or part of the population).
.Moreover, the Committee urges the Government to guarantee that collective agreements between management and unions be respected. It also requests the Government to encourage the social partners to resolve collective disputes by means of collective bargaining.
.With regard to the  trade union leaders and unionists dismissed and to be replaced in endeavours, as the enterprise asserts, to ensure a minimum service, the Committee observes that Brazilian legislation recognizes the right to strike in the petroleum sector to the extent that a minimum service is maintained. The Committee also observes that the complainant's and Government's versions differ in respect of whether the minimum services were effectively guaranteed during the strike: the complainant claims that, in the course of the strikes, hospital, industrial and domestic supplies were safeguarded, whereas the Government asserts that, in order to ensure such supplies, the enterprise was obliged to dismiss and replace some workers on strike. In view of this contradiction between the relevant allegations and the Government's reply, and given that the court sentences provided by the Government allude generally to strong evidence of non-compliance with the  per cent minimum service without however adequately indicating specific work centres or workers, the Committee is not in a position to reach conclusions on this question. Moreover, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, the strike action in the petroleum sector was declared abusive by the Supreme Labour Tribunal at the enterprise's request, in view of the fact that ""a collective standard established by the Tribunal"" was in force (a sentence which sets the working conditions to be respected by the parties).
.In this context, given that the Committee has specifically criticized the fact that the dispute was submitted unilaterally to the Tribunal in question and in view of the fact that this was a tense, complex and very lengthy conflict, that the complainant makes reference to two agreements signed with the Government and with the enterprise respectively and that, in its opinion, these agreements were not respected, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the  trade union leaders and unionists who have been dismissed.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to amend legislation so that the submission of collective interest disputes to the judicial authorities is only possible by common agreement between the parties or in the case of essential services in the strict sense of the term (the interruption of which may endanger the life, personal safety or health of all or part of the population).(b) The Committee urges the Government to guarantee that collective agreements between workers and unions be respected. It also requests the Government to encourage the social partners to resolve collective disputes by means of collective bargaining.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the  trade union leaders and unionists dismissed by Petrobrs.",-1,1995,Brazil
68,".The complaint in this case is contained in a communication from the Inter-State Federation of Trade Unions of Civilian Police Workers dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) but has ratified the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organization alleges in its communication of  June  that the President of the Trade Union of Civilian Police Officers of Mato Grosso del Sur, Mr. Eder Luiz Red, was suspended from his post for  days for having sent a note to the local press in November  criticizing the Assistant Secretary of Public Safety for decisions which had repercussions on working conditions in the civilian police force.
.The complainant adds that the President of the Trade Union of Civilian Police Officers of Mato Grosso del Sur was dismissed following administrative proceedings for denunciations which he made to the Legislative Assembly concerning working conditions in the police force.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that in violation of national legislation the Secretary of the Administration of the State of Mato Grosso decided to suspend the check-off of trade union dues.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that disciplinary proceedings were taken against the police officer Mr. Eder Luiz Red for his failure to fulfil his obligations under articles  and  of the Civilian Police Statute of the State of Mato Grosso, for offences committed through the communication media against the Assistant Secretary of Public Safety. The Government points out that the trade union status of Mr. Red does not relieve him of his obligation to act as a police officer and to respect the principles of hierarchy and discipline.
.Administrative proceedings were taken against the police officer Mauricio Godoy, who as President of the Trade Union of Civilian Police Officers of Mato Grosso del Sur denounced offences allegedly committed by his superiors. If no sanctions were finally imposed on him, this was because the Secretary of Public Safety decided to pardon him.
.Finally, the Government states that the matter of the suspension of the check-off of trade union dues has been submitted to the judicial authorities.
.The Committee notes the complainant's allegations referring to sanctions against officials of the Trade Union of Police Officers of Mato Grosso del Sur and the suspension of the check-off of trade union dues. The Committee has also noted the observations of the Government in this respect.
.The Committee recalls that Brazil has ratified Convention No.  and that this Convention contains a provision respecting its application to the police force which reads as follows:The extent to which the guarantee is provided for in this Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police shall be determined by national law or regulations (Article , paragraph  of Convention No. ).
.In pursuance of this text, there is no doubt that the International Labour Conference intended to allow each State to judge to what extent it is appropriate to grant members of the armed forces and the police the rights provided for by the Convention, that is, by implication, that States which have ratified the Convention are not obliged to grant these rights to those categories of workers (th Report, Case No.  (France), para. ).
.In these circumstances, since the Convention has left the matter for the appreciation of member States, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",-1,1993,Brazil
69,".The Committee last examined this case which concerns the murder, on  September , of the trade union leader Valdicio Barbosa dos Santos at its March  meeting (see th Report, para. ) and, at that time, noted that: the legal proceedings concerning this case were still pending before the tribunal of the State of Espritu Santo (in appeal from the criminal court) following an appeal lodged by Romualdo Eustquio Luz Faria -- accused of having participated in the aggravated homicide and liable to penalties of  to  years' solitary confinement provided for in sections ()(I) and (IV) and  of the Penal Code -- and that the other accused, Gilberto Maral da Rocha had not yet been located, which was why the sentence had not been served on him. The Committee had asked the Government to keep it informed of the final result of the legal proceedings in question.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government states that the appeal lodged by the accused Romualdo Eustquio Luz Faria had been turned down. In connection with the other accused, Gilberto Maral da Rocha, the Government states that there was enough evidence to presume that he was guilty of the crime; however, given that he was still on the run and that an order had been issued summoning him to appear in order to be detained pending his trial, he was declared to be in contempt of court and the period of prescription for the legal proceedings was suspended.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights against the Government of Brazil in a communication dated  September  at the request of the Workers' Central Organisation (CUT), which is affiliated to it. The Government sent its comments and observations on this case in a communication dated  December .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a telex dated  September , the ICFTU denounced the murder on  September  of trade union leader Valdcio Barbosa dos Santos, a member of the executive of the Rural Workers' Union in the town of Pedro Canrio, Espirito Santo State. According to the ICFTU, this leader was shot three times with a rifle on his way home from taking his daughter to school. The first persons who arrived on the scene allegedly saw policemen and unidentified persons near the victim's body; they allegedly subsequently disappeared from the town, together with the police inspector. The ICFTU requests the ILO to demand that the Brazilian authorities institute an inquiry and punish those guilty of this murder.
.In a letter dated  December , the Government admits that the leader of the Rural Workers' Association of Pedro Canrio and Conceiao de Baria, Valdcio Barbosa dos Santos, known as ""Lo"", was murdered on  September  at  a.m., six kilometres from his home in the Floresta do Sul district in the town of Pedro Canrio, Espirito Santo State, with three -calibre bullets. The Government explains that this trade union leader was a former candidate of the Workers' Party (PT/Pedro Canrio) to the town council and a member of the grass-roots ecclesiastical community of Floresta do Sul.
.The Government alleges that this trade union leader was one of the main organisers of the occupation of the Ipuema farm in the Floresta do Sul district, which took place on  June  and during which the owner of the farm, Jos Machado Neto, and Sergio Narcisio da Silva, a soldier in the Espirito Santo military police, were killed. Since then, according to the Government, Valdcio Barbosa dos Santos was living under death threats.
.The Government adds that the persons suspected of having ordered this murder were Antonio Wilson Fiorot, a doctor, and Galeno Tinoco de Resende, a doctor and landowner, both relatives of Jos Machado Neto. The person suspected of having committed the murder is Jos Monteiro de Barros Filho, known as ""Ze Capeta"".
.Lastly, the Government states that an administrative inquiry was instituted by the civil police of Espirito Santo State, led by police inspector Jos Meyer, but that the accused persons had still not been found.
.The Committee notes that this case concerns the murder of a rural trade union leader, Valdcio Barbosa dos Santos, leader of the Rural Workers' Association. The Government does not deny the facts but claims that the murder followed the violent occupation of a farm, led by this trade union leader, and the death of the owner of the farm and a soldier defending it. The Government names the persons suspected of having committed the crime but states that they have not yet been found.
.The Committee, for its part, strongly deplores the murder of the trade union leader referred to in this case. It recalls that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the murder or disappearance of trade union leaders constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights; such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, third edition, , para. ).
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to ensure that an independent judicial inquiry be carried out in order to ascertain fully the facts, determine responsibilities, punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such actions.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee strongly deplores the murder of the leader of the Rural Workers' Association, Valdcio Barbosa dos Santos, and recalls that a climate of violence and intimidation constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights.(b) While noting that, according to the information supplied by the Government, an administrative inquiry has been instituted by the civil police of Espirito Santo State regarding this matter, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that an independent judicial inquiry be carried out in order to fully ascertain the facts, determine responsibilities, punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such actions.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this inquiry and, in particular, to state whether the persons suspected of having ordered or committed this murder have been arrested and tried.",-1,1989,Brazil
70,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of violation of freedom of association in Brazil in a communication of  January . The Government sent its observations in response to this complaint in communications of  and  April .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); on the other hand, it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU states that it is alarmed by the provisions of Brazil's new Constitution of  October , which reproduce certain aspects of earlier trade union legislation which, according to the ICFTU, are incompatible with Convention No. .
.The ICFTU recognises that the new Constitution has introduced a number of provisions with a view to guaranteeing a greater freedom for trade unions
vis--vis the State. However, it regrets that the new Constitution retains the two primary features of the corporatist structure of Brazilian trade unionism, namely, trade union monopoly and the trade union tax.
.In this connection, the constitutional text is inconsistent in
providing that ""there shall be no more than one trade union of any kind representing the same occupational or economic category of workers in a given territorial area"", while at the same time prohibiting any kind of intervention by the authorities in the activities of trade unions, and abolishing the previous requirement for state authorisation for the creation of trade unions. Moreover, it specifies that the territorial area will be defined by the workers, but stipulates that it may not be smaller than a municipality.
.In addition, by providing that ""the General Assembly shall set the
level of contributions to be deducted from the pay of workers in a given occupational category for the financing of the confederational system, independently of the contribution required by law"", the Constitution not only provides for contributions to be set by the General Assembly which will also
finance federations and confederations (as opposed to the earlier practice where the contribution was primarily designed to help in the financing of trade unions), but maintains the trade union contribution required by law.
.The ICFTU concludes that the new Constitution abolishes previous trade union legislation, including provisions governing collective bargaining, the registration of trade union organisations and the maintenance of the compulsory trade union contribution.
.It also concludes that freedom to organise trade unions should be
guaranteed, that an Act will identify the agencies responsible for the registration of trade union organisations, and that workers shall decide in the event of a duplication of trade union representation and as regards the definition of territorial areas for given trade union organisations, as provided for in the Constitution.
.Nevertheless, the ICFTU doubts that the foregoing will in fact take place in Brazil in the light of a number of events which have taken place since the new Constitution was promulgated. For example, it explains, on  October  one of Brazil's trade union confederations, the Workers' Central Organisation (CUT), filed for registration and the recording of its by-laws with the Ministry of Labour. At the same time, it requested registration in the ""Record of Titles and Documents"". It was compelled to follow this double procedure in order to become established as a legal entity, in the absence of any competent agency to handle registrations.
.At the same time, the then Minister of Labour promulgated a Decree
which contained interim provisions for the registration of new trade union organisations, establishing a procedure based on the new constitutional provisions which, without any doubt, tend to favour the legal existence of certain confederations.
.However, several days later, a new Minister of Labour convened almost all workers' and employers' confederations to discuss the distribution of  per cent of the trade union contribution, which had previously been allocated to the Ministry of Labour, and the question of competence for the registration of new trade union organisations.
.The ICFTU adds that immediately after this meeting, on  November , the new Minister of Labour revoked his predecessor's Decree (Ministerial Decree No. ); several newspapers throughout the country reported that a ""National Council of Trade Union Confederations"" had been convened to discuss the above-mentioned questions concerning the registration of trade unions and the allocation of trade union contributions.
.These facts lead the ICFTU to believe that certain parties, with the consent and support of the Government, seek to promote a situation which will restrict freedom of association and foster conditions to ensure that future legislation will maintain certain aspects of the earlier law.
.The ICFTU adds that the gravity of the current situation is illustrated by the fact that one of the de facto confederations has not yet received any reply to its request for legal recognition. It therefore concludes that certain parties are promoting an irreversible situation which is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and trade union autonomy.
.In its first reply of  April  the Government states that the
country is taking its first tentative steps under the new Constitution, and is going through a period of transition as regards political, juridical and trade union relations. It adds that there is ongoing progress in the development of direct relations between employers' and workers' representatives, and that both groups sincerely wish to overcome any differences concerning the economic and social order.
.The Government states that within the context of this new framework of industrial relations, the Ministry of Labour acts simply as an arbitrator, and a mediator in debates concerning industrial relations.
.According to the Government, the social interlocutors have
traditionally been the leaders of employers' and workers' confederations, and the managers of the national economy's most important sectors. The national confederations of workers have been invited to participate in these debates to ensure the authenticity of negotiations and to safeguard shared interests.
.The Government assures that the new legislation will regulate all
aspects of political and trade union relations and industrial relations, in particular through widespread consultation with rank and file members, in keeping with certain principles contained in the Constitution, such as the confederational system, the pre-eminence of trade union monopoly in the same branch of economic activity, the specificity of representation of economic and occupational categories (by industry, commerce, services, etc.), and of the liberal professions, the management of the trade union contribution, as provided for in current legislation, for the maintenance of services and programmes relating to class organisation.
.According to the Government, the federal Constitution enshrines the principles of freedom of association and trade union autonomy as central features of the new trade union order, and confers upon trade union leaders complete responsibility for their own fate, whether in the area of political or class action, or in that of internal management, including financial management. The Constitution guarantees that the authorities will not interfere or intervene in the organisation or dissolution of trade unions (other than by means of judicial decisions), the freedom of workers to join trade unions, or by requiring state authorisation for the establishment of new trade unions.
.The Government clarifies, however, that the Constitution nevertheless requires the registration of legal instruments with the agency responsible for the establishment of trade union organisations. This responsibility will certainly fall to the Ministry of Labour, following a tradition which for approximately  years has seen these matters handled by the Labour Relations Secretariat, and to regional and state delegations which will continue to ensure that the above-mentioned constitutional principles are respected.
.As regards strikes, the Government states that it will respect the
constitutional principle and confine itself to guaranteeing to strikers their right to participate peacefully in any strike and to help prevent accidents which sometimes result from the spirited defence of one's interests.
.Lastly, the Government states that all of the points raised by the
complainants will be taken into consideration to ensure that excellent and fruitful relations are developed with the Workers' Central Organisation (CUT).
.In a second communication of  April , the Government adds that the debates which led to the adoption of the new Constitution took place in a context of democracy and freedom of speech. Parties and political groups representing all currents were allowed to express their opinions in public and congressional debates. Inevitably, the Constitution was not able to accommodate all opinions expressed, inasmuch as many of these were incompatible and sought to promote the aspirations of individual sectors of society. However, the Constitution did succeed in capturing a consensus of the opinions expressed during the months preceding its promulgation, with a view to promoting new social, political and economic conditions in the country.
.The Government then lists the constitutional provisions contained in Chapter II on social rights (articles  to ) which, according to it, reflect the democratic principles that guided the formulation of the Constitution, namely the social rights to education, health, work, leisure, security, social insurance, the protection of maternity and children, and assistance to the most disadvantaged (section ).
.The Constitution proclaims that the rights of workers in cities and throughout the country include: protection against arbitrary and unjustified dismissal, protection against unemployment, the guarantee of a national minimum wage set by law to provide",-1,1989,Brazil
71,"for basic needs, wage increments for night work, profit-sharing, the concept of a family wage for workers with dependants, an eight-hour workday and a -hour work-week, a six-hour workday for shift work, a weekly paid day of rest, preferably Sunday,  per cent higher pay for overtime, the right to annual leave paid at  per cent of normal wages, maternity leave without loss of wages for  days, paternity leave as established by law, the promotion of women in the labour market by means of specific incentives, notice of dismissal to be established by law in proportion to the length of service, but in no event less than  days, the reduction of occupational risks by means of better health and safety standards, free crches and other pre-school centres for children up to the age of six, the recognition of collective labour agreements, the protection of workers vis--vis automation, insurance against employment accidents at the employer's expense plus the payment of damages by the employer where he is held to be negligent or at fault, the prohibition of wage differentials for equal work based on sex, age or civil status, the prohibition of any discrimination as regards wages, the prohibition of discrimination between manual, technical or intellectual workers or between different occupations prohibitions on night work, dangerous work and unhealthy work as regards persons under  years of age, and on any kind of work as regards persons under  years of age, unless as apprentices (article ).
.The Government explains that the Constitution also enshrined the
principle of freedom of association by providing, inter alia, that the law may not require the State's authorisation for the creation of trade unions, that it will reserve the registration of trade unions to competent agencies, and that it will prohibit the authorities from interfering and intervening in the organisation of trade unions. Furthermore, the Constitution prohibits the creation of more than one trade union organisation of any kind to represent a given economic or occupational categories of workers in a given territorial area to be defined by the workers and employers concerned, provided that this area is not smaller than a municipality. The Constitution also provides that it shall be the responsibility of trade unions to defend the collective or individual rights and interests of workers, including judicial and administrative questions; that the General Assembly shall set the contribution which, for a given occupational category, shall be withheld at the source in order to finance the confederational system, independently of the contribution called for by law; and that no worker shall be required to join or remain a member of a trade union. In addition, the Constitution states that trade union organisations must participate in collective bargaining, that members have the right to vote and hold office in trade union organisations, and that it is unlawful to dismiss a unionised worker after he has filed as a candidate for trade union office, or if he is elected to office, even as an alternate, until one year after the expiration of his term in office, unless he is found guilty of a felony. These provisions apply also to the organisation of trade unions in agriculture and fishing (article ).
.Lastly, the Government states that the Constitution recognises the
right to strike and provides that it is up to the workers to decide when to exercise this right and the interests in respect of which it is used. It adds that the law will define essential services or activities and regulate their maintenance. Any abuses in this connection will be punished as provided for by law (article ).
.The Committee notes that the ICFTU's allegations essentially concern threats to freedom of association inherent in certain provisions of the new Constitution which Brazil adopted on  October , even though the text embodies a number of improvements, and the difficulties encountered by a trade union confederation, the CUT, in obtaining its registration as a trade union organisation.
.The Committee notes the assurances furnished by the Government concerning the matter of the CUT's registration, and in particular that the Government will take into consideration all comments made by the complainants with a view to ensuring harmonious and fruitful relations with the CUT.
.The Committee hopes that the CUT will soon be registered, and that in accordance with the principles of freedom of association and trade union autonomy, it will enjoy all the prerogatives of trade union organisations in the defence and promotion of the economic and social interests of its members, including those which concern collective bargaining of conditions of employment and the exercise of the right to strike.
.Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to let it know whether the CUT has been duly registered, and to keep it informed of any developments which occur on the basis of the principles mentioned in the foregoing paragraph.
.On the questions of law, and particularly on the questions of trade union monopoly by occupational category in a territorial area defined by workers and employers, and on the question of the financing of the confederational system, the Committee notes that the opinions expressed by the complainants and the Government are at odds.
.On the first question, the Committee notes that article  of the Constitution provides (a)that the law may not require authorisation for the establishment of a trade union, that it reserves registration to the competent authority and prohibits the authorities from interfering or intervening in the organisation of trade unions. However, article  also states that (b)it is forbidden to establish more than one trade union of any kind to represent the same occupational or economic category of workers in a territorial area to be defined by the workers and employers concerned, but in no case smaller than a municipality. In other words, the Constitution itself requires trade union monopoly by occupational category regardless of organisational level. The Committee therefore considers that this constitutional provision is not compatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the financing of the confederational system, the Committee notes that article  of the Constitution provides that the General Assembly of the trade union shall set the level of contributions to be withheld from wages of given occupational categories of workers and used in financing the confederational system, independently of the contribution provided for by law. It also notes that no worker shall be required to join or remain a member of any trade union. Although the Constitution does not make trade union affiliation compulsory, and does not designate the beneficiary confederation, it requires the payment of what the complainants refer to as a ""trade union tax""; in other words, it requires the deduction of a trade union contribution from the wages of workers in different occupational categories for the financing and maintenance of the confederational system of trade union representation, even though it allows the trade union's General Assembly to set the amount of the same. In addition, it also maintains the principle of the trade union contribution provided for by law.
.The Committee considers that the questions concerning the financing of trade union organisations, as regards both their own budgets and those of federations or confederations, should be governed by the by-laws of the trade unions, federations and confederations themselves, and therefore, that constitutional or legal provisions which require contributions are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) As regards the Workers' Central Organisation (CUT), the Committee expresses the hope that this Confederation will be duly registered as soon as possible, and that it will enjoy all the privileges of trade union organisations in the defence and promotion of the economic and social interests of its members, including the rights of collective bargaining and the right to strike.b) The Committee requests the Government to let it know if and when the CUT has been duly registered, and to keep it informed of any developments in this area.c) While noting with interest that several provisions of the new Constitution have enhanced the freedom of trade unions vis--vis the State, the Committee considers that the provisions of article  of Brazil's Constitution of  October , concerning the prohibition of creating more than one trade union for a given occupational or economic category of workers, regardless of the level of organisation, in a given territorial area which, in no case, may be smaller than a municipality, and those concerning the financing of the confederational system, are not compatible with the principles of freedom of association.d) The Committee expresses the hope that trade union legislation compatible with the principles of freedom of association, and in particular with the right of workers to establish and join organisations of their choice, whether by occupational category or at the level of the enterprise, and the right of workers' organisations freely to draw up their by-laws and run their affairs autonomously, in particular as regards the financing of the confederational system, will soon be adopted.e) The Committee",-1,1989,Brazil
72,"recalls that the ILO is at the disposal of the Government, if the latter so wishes, to help it draft such legislation.",-1,1989,Brazil
73,".The allegations presented by complainants in these two cases werecontained in the following communications: from the InternationalConfederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  June and  November 
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Rightto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its initial complaint of  June , the ICFTU explains thatworkers in the service of the State launched several protest actions at thenational level in April  against Government Decree No.  of freezing for two months (April-May) the salaries of federal public employeesand of workers in state enterprises. In view of the Government's refusal toenter into discussions with the trade unions, the trade union organisations inthe public sector and state enterprises decided to call a -hour strike on 
.The ICFTU goes on to say that the strike was called by  trade unionorganisations, representing  / million workers, and that it paralysed fullyor partly all the sectors affected by the Decree, namely oil, metallurgy, theports, electricity, chemicals, banks, railways, mining and telephones. Thestriking trade union organisations appointed a national co-ordinationcommittee of representatives of workers in state enterprises and of publicemployees. On  May the co-ordinating committee requested a meeting with theMinisters of Labour and of the Economy. The former did not open negotiationsand the latter refused to receive the workers' representatives.
.The Government called in the army to repress the strike and to occupythe Petrobras and Duque de Caxias oil refineries in the State of Rio deJaneiro. At the Cubatao refinery in Sao Paulo,  workers coming off a shiftwere forced by the army to stay and work the following shift - which meantsleeping and eating in the refinery.
.At EMBRAER, an aeronautics enterprise at San Jos dos Campos in theState of Sao Paulo,  workers were dismissed, including the works committeeand trade union leaders. The aeronautics police forced the strikers at bayonetpoint to return to work.
.At the Jaguariri copper mines in the State of Bahia,  workers,including  trade union leaders, eight members of the works committee and tendirectors of the Public Employees' Association were dismissed.
.Still in the mining sector, at Carajs in the State of Par,  tradeunion leaders of the local association were dismissed and expelled from theiraccommodations (which belong to the enterprise); they were warned that theywould be expelled on  May. Twelve workers from Puerto de Santos were alsodismissed.
.In a subsequent communication dated  November , the ICFTU furtherindicates that since  November , , workers from the MetallurgicalTrade Union of the Volta Redonda National Iron and Steel Company are on strikeand are occupying the plant to secure the recovery of the  per cent wagelosses of recent months, a wage readjustment of . per cent for the monthof July, the reinstatement of  of their colleagues who were dismissedfollowing an earlier strike, and a six-hour working day on the basis of threedaily shifts.
.On  November , the ICFTU continues, the police and the army raidedthe plant at  p.m., using tear-gas and sub-machine guns; they killed fiveworkers and left dozens seriously injured. The trade unionists who were killedare Joao Carlos Barroso, William Fernandez Leita, Wladimir Freitas Monteiro,Victor Adriani and Vincente Silva. According to the ICFTU, the plant is stilloccupied by over , armed soldiers and surrounded by tanks.
.The WFTU, in its complaint of  November , denounces the events atVolta Redonda and claims that , workers are on strike and that, inaddition to the five workers who were killed (and it cites the same names asthose given by the ICFTU),  were injured and four persons - Mauricio Plata,Jos de Almayda, Osvaldino Gmez and Marcelino Alvez - are missing. The WFTUadds that on  November ,  workers from the National Iron and SteelCompany of Rio de Janeiro, together with workers from the Casa Piedra MiningCompany in the State of Minas Gerais, came out on strike in solidarity withthe workers of Volta Redonda and that five workers were injured inconfrontations with the army.
.The ICFTU, however, in a letter dated  January , amends itsprevious letter stating that three, not five, workers were killed: Mr.Fernandes Filho and Mr. Freitas Monteiro who were shot, and Mr. Barroso whodied after his skull was broken by blows.
.The WCOTP, in its letter of  November , denounces the violentintervention by the police (with tear-gas and cavalry charges) on  October
.In its first reply of  February , the Government furnishes acertain amount of information and observations concerning the allegations madeby the WCOTP concerning the alleged anti-union reprisals against teachers,students and employees of the University of Sao Paulo on  October during a demonstration in respect of pay claims. In this connection theGovernment states that the Regional Delegation for Labour of Sao Paulo, whichit consulted on the matter, had informed it that employees of the universityhad indeed organised a campaign in front of the headquarters of the Governorof the state with a view to obtaining better salaries within the framework ofthe municipal election campaign of . The Government confirms that thepersons concerned held several public demonstrations but claims that none ofthese took place near the Governor's Palace or involved a dispute with thestate military police. The Government states that an investigation is beingcarried out by the competent bodies of the Government of the State of SaoPaulo to determine who was responsible.
.In another reply, dated  April , concerning allegations by theICFTU in respect of anti-union reprisals against public employees and workersin state enterprises, following a -hour strike in support of pay claims in
.The Government goes on to explain that the presence of the military inthe Duque de Caxias oil refinery was designed to protect public property andavoid it being damaged and that this helped to ensure that the strike remainedpeaceful.
.Still according to the Government, the workers who were dismissed atPorto Santos have all been reinstated following negotiations.
.The Government states that the account given of the events which tookplace at the EMBRAER enterprise is inaccurate. It maintains that on  and August  workers of this enterprise went on strike claiming a  per centwage increase with the support of the Metallurgical Trade Union which hadremained inside the plant on  August when the strikers occupied the works. On
.As regards the dismissal of the three trade union leaders, BeneditoCarlos de Sousa, Francisco Assis de Souza and Joao Pedro Pires, a judicialinquiry was opened before the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Sao Josdos Campos to determine whether there had been serious misconduct constitutingjust grounds for the dismissal of the said trade union leaders. In the courseof the appeal lodged by the dismissed leaders, the enterprise proposed anagreement, which was ratified. According to this agreement, the leaderssecured the guaranteed maintenance of their rights as though they had not beendismissed on just grounds. This agreement was approved by the regionaltribunal of the second region of Sao Paulo.
.Thirty-three of the  workers whose dismissal had been approved bythe trade union were reinstated in the enterprise.
.The Government concludes its statement on this allegation by specifyingthat the strike in question was judged to be illegal by the Sao Paulo LabourCourt as a result of which, at the time, the workers concerned were deemed tohave committed serious misconduct. At the same time, the Government claims, noone was dismissed on unjust grounds.
.The Government refutes, moreover, the allegations concerning thedismissal of  trade union leaders at Carajs in the State of Par.
.More generally, the Government specifies, as regards the pay freeze forthe months of April and May  of federal public employees and of workers instate enterprises, that in fact Legislative Decree No.  of  providedfor a . per cent pay increase for August  based on the cost of livingfor April , and that Act No.  of  established . per cent payincreases for November  based on the cost of living for May .
.As regards the allegations made both by the ICFTU and by the WFTUconcerning the social conflict in November  within the National Iron andSteel Company at Volta Redonda in the State of Rio de Janeiro, the Governmentstates, in a further communication dated  April , that thismixed-economy company is one of the largest iron and steel works in thecountry and that it generates thousands of jobs and is a major source offoreign currency. The Government confirms that on  November  a strikebroke out among the , workers of this enterprise, as stated by the WFTU(not , as stated by the ICFTU). The Government also confirms that thestrikers demanded pay increases and better conditions of work as well as thereinstatement of workers who had been dismissed for having participated in aprevious strike. The Government adds that the strikers occupied the steelworks, which are a vital sector of the plant housing the blast furnaces.
.According to the Government, the aggressiveness which marked theatmosphere from the beginning of the dispute and which resulted in a deadlockin the negotiations on the claims, together with a series of incidents inwhich the property of the iron and steel works was",-1,1988,Brazil
74,"damaged, motivated theinjunction requisitioning the plant and the appointment of a judge, Mr. MoissCohen, to prevent further damage being done to the Company's property. In viewof the difficulties encountered by the officer of the law appointed by thejudge, the latter decided that energetic measures were called for to safeguardthe property and people who are lawfully in the enterprise. He thereforecalled out the th infantry battalion, who were stationed at Barra Mansa andwho ordered everyone who was unlawfully within the enterprise to leave it soas to safeguard the property belonging to the said enterprise.
.Still according to the Government, the exasperation and aggressivenessof the strikers and the breakdown of the negotiations for a peacefulwithdrawal from the works led to direct confrontation between the military andthe workers and the death of three persons (not five as originally stated bythe complainants).
.In order to clarify the facts and to establish who was responsible, thefollowing proceedings were instituted: () a police inquiry into the murder on
.The Government also states that the records of the police of VoltaRedonda make no mention of any person reported missing and that no complaintin this respect has been lodged before any other body.
.The Committee notes with concern that these two cases relate tomeasures of repression against strikers that are particularly serious sincethe Government itself does not deny that, following action in respect of payclaims, workers in the public service and in state enterprises have beendismissed, injured and even killed. The Government admits that it called inthe army and police to ensure the maintenance of law and order. According tothe complainant, in some instances this recourse to the army and the policewas aimed at expelling workers who were occupying their enterprise. TheGovernment indicates, however, that some dismissed trade union leaders ormilitants were subsequently reinstated.
.The Government also indicates that the strikes or demonstrations whichoriginated in opposition to Government Decree No.  of  in respect ofthe remuneration of these categories of employees (which remuneration wasfrozen for two months - April-May  - instead of keeping pace withinflation) were illegal since they were called by workers in the publicservice and in state enterprises who do not enjoy the right to strike.
.The Committee deplores the fact that a number of workers were dismissedfor going on strike and have not been reinstated and the fact that armyintervention to expel strikers who were occupying their enterprise resulted ininjury to some persons and that others were killed.
.As regards these violent deaths and the injuries inflicted, theCommittee observes that police inquiries were undertaken to determine thefacts and punish those responsible and that court proceedings are under way tojudge the members of the army who were responsible for the murders and for theinjuries inflicted on trade unionists. Without prejudice to these proceedings,the Committee recalls that trade union rights can only be exercised in aclimate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind againsttrade unionists; it is for governments to ensure that this principle isrespected (see paragraph  of the Digest of Decisions and Principles of theFreedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body) . The InternationalLabour Conference, in a resolution concerning trade union rights and theirrelation to civil liberties, emphasised that the lack of civil liberty rendersthe concept of trade union rights meaningless and that the rights conferred onorganisations of workers and employers must be based on respect for thesecivil liberties. The Committee has endorsed this principle on innumerableoccasions.
.Consequently, the Committee urges the authorities to adopt effectivemeasures with a view to restoring a normal situation and to inform it of theoutcome of the court proceedings under way concerning those responsible forthe murder and injury of trade unionists.
.As regards the military and police repression inflicted on the manycategories of strikers who are considered by the Government of Brazil to bepublic employees and workers in state enterprises who do not enjoy the rightto strike in support of legitimate pay claims, the Committee can only recallyet again the importance it attaches to the strike as a legitimate means ofsupporting claims - a means of which workers and their organisations should beable to avail themselves for the defence of their occupational interests. TheCommittee recalls once again the principle established by the supervisorybodies of the ILO in this respect, namely that the right to strike can berestricted or even prohibited in the civil service or in essential services,whether public, semi-public or private, but that these restrictions orprohibitions would be meaningless if the laws and regulations established toobroad a definition of the public service or of essential services.Consequently, the Committee has frequently pointed out that a prohibition onstrikes should be confined to civil servants acting as representatives of thepublic authorities or in services whose interruption would endanger the life,personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population.
.In the Committee's opinion, in the circumstances of the present case,the right to strike should not be denied to workers in the sectors referred toin the present case, provided that the strikes of the workers in these sectorsdo not endanger the life, health or safety of the population.
.The Committee therefore requests the Government to provide it withinformation on all measures it contemplates in order to bring its laws andregulations in line with the above-mentioned principles.
.It also urges the Government to endeavour to obtain the reinstatementof all workers who were dismissed in connection with the labour disputesmentioned by the complainants in the present cases.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites theGoverning Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee deplores the anti-union violence that resulted in violentdeaths and injuries in confrontations with the military and police forces whoexpelled strikers in sectors wrongly considered by the Government to beessential.b) The Committee requests the Government to adopt effective measures inorder to re-establish a normal situation and to inform it of the outcome ofthe court proceedings under way concerning the persons responsible for themurder and injuries perpetrated against trade unionists, especially in VoltaRedonda.c) In the circumstances of this case, the Committee is of the opinion thatthe right to strike should not be denied to the workers of sectors referred toin the present case, provided the strikes do not endanger the life, personalsafety or health of the population. The Committee requests the Government tokeep it informed of all measures it is contemplating to bring its laws andregulations concerning strikes in line with these principles.d) The Committee urges the Government to endeavour to obtain thereinstatement of all workers dismissed in connection with the labour disputesmentioned by the complainants, especially in the EMBRAER aeronauticsenterprise of San Jos dos Campos, and to keep it informed of developments inthe situation in this respect.",-1,1988,Brazil

The Committee requests the Government tokeep it informed of all measures it is contemplating to bring its laws andregulations concerning strikes in line with these principles.d) The Committee urges the Government to endeavour to obtain thereinstatement of all workers dismissed in connection with the labour disputesmentioned by the complainants, especially in the EMBRAER aeronauticsenterprise of San Jos dos Campos, and to keep it informed of developments inthe situation in this respect.",-1,1988,Brazil
77,".The complaint is contained in a communication of the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) dated  October . The WCOTP sent further information in a communication dated  November . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCOTP alleges in its communication of  October  that  lecturers have been dismissed from the University of Santa Ursula in Rio de Janeiro. While some of these lecturers were allegedly dismissed for administrative reasons, in other cases the dismissals were quite obviously on political (trade union) grounds, since they concerned lecturers who were organising a strike. One of the persons dismissed was the first Vice-President of the National Association of Higher Education Teachers (ANDES), Professor Sydney Solis, head of the local branch of ANDES at the University. He was subsequently reinstated by decision of a local court which ruled that his dismissal was an infringement of the trade union legislation.
.In its communication of  November , the WCOTP cites the following lecturers as having been dismissed on political grounds: Francisco Caminha, Teresa Martins, Ernesto Paganelli, Gil Goes, Fabio Lemos, Jandira Barreto, Ari Barreto, Mario Rocha and Luis Edmundo (reinstated by order of a local court).
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that, at the request of the trade union operating in the University of Santa Ursula, a round table was held on  June  at which the trade union protested against the non-payment of certain wage benefits provided for in the collective agreement applying to the University. This was confirmed by the University itself, which stated that its financial situation was such that it was quite incapable of meeting the said payments but undertook to look into the demands of the professional category concerned. Although the University is still experiencing financial difficulties, the payment of salaries including increments is currently up to date, though the lecturers' pay is still slightly in arrears.
.The Government adds that the dismissals were the outcome of this situation and affected about  auxiliary members of the administrative staff. The Government notes further that since June  the Regional Labour Delegation has not received any request to take action and that a permanent dialogue continues to exist between the trade union and the University.
.The Committee notes that the versions of the alleged dismissals given by the complainant and by the Government differ. The complainant organisation maintains that ten of the lecturers at the University of Santa Ursula were dismissed not for administrative reasons, as claimed, but on politico-trade union grounds, and specifically because they were organising a strike; two of them were subsequently reinstated. According to the Government, the dismissals, which affected some  people, were the result of the University's financial difficulties.
.Given the differing versions of the complainant and of the Government, the Committee wishes to recall the principle laid down in the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), regarding the protection of workers' representatives and the facilities to be afforded to them, namely that the specific protective measures might include ""recognition of a priority to be given to workers' representatives with regard to their retention in employment in case of reduction of the workforce"". In this connection, the Committee observes that the only dismissed lecturer whom the complainant specifically describes as a trade union leader (Sydney Solis) was reinstated by court decision.
.In these circumstances, and in the absence of any more detailed information regarding either the complainant's allegation or the Government's response, the Committee can only express the wish that the continuing dialogue between the ANDES trade union and the University of Santa Ursula will lead to the reinstatement of the workers dismissed for their trade union activities.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take steps so that the continuing dialogue between the ANDES trade union and the University of Santa Ursula will lead to the reinstatement of the workers dismissed for their trade union activities.",-1,1987,Brazil

.Since then the Government has sent communications dated  February and
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection ofthe Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Rightto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The pending allegations on which this complaint is based referred tothe Government's use of the military and police forces to prevent strikes inthe ports and oil refineries based on wage claims (acting on the basis ofLegislative Decree No.  of  August ) and to the murder of MauroPires, leader of the Union of Vehicle Drivers and Allied Workers of SanAndrs, on  September , an attack perpetrated on trade union leader JosBarbosa dos Santos by two individuals who shot at him from a car, and deaththreats made by telephone against union leader Paulo Pereira. More recentallegations made in December  and January  concerned the murder on December  of Francisco Alves Mendes Filho, union leader of the ruralworkers of Xapuri, in the State of Acre, in the Amazon region, who waspresident of the rubber industry trade union (SERINGA) and national leader ofthe Workers' Central Organisation (CUT).
.The Government had not replied to most of these allegations by theFebruary-March  Session. However, as regards the strikes held in March
.At its February-March  meeting, the Committee had adopted thefollowing recommendations:a) The Committee deeply regrets the fact that the Government has failed tosend all of the information on the pending allegations: the murder of tradeunion leaders Mauro Pires on  September  and Francisco Alves Mendes Filho
.In its first reply dated  February , which reached the Officeafter the end of the February-March session of the Committee, referring to themurder of Francisco Alves Mendes Filho on the night of  December , theGovernment stated that, upon being informed of the threats received by thisunion leader, the Governor of the State of Acre had decided to appointmilitary police officers to protect the physical integrity of this person.Once this deplorable act had been perpetrated, the Secretariat for PublicSecurity, which is the investigating body, entrusted a special delegate withthe investigation and reinforced civil and military police contingents inorder to elucidate the facts. This police delegate had conducted an inquiry on
.In a subsequent reply dated  April , referring to theintervention of the armed forces in the strikes held in the ports and oilrefineries in March , the Government states that strikes in theseactivities were prohibited at the time, since such activities were consideredas essential in so far as they involved the supply of fuel and food and inview of the public security nature of maritime and port activities. Thepurpose of the army's presence in Petrobrs was to protect the public propertyof a semi-public enterprise belonging to the public administration and tosecure free access to work for the persons concerned. According to theGovernment, there had been no incidents involving striking workers and/orunion leaders. To conclude, as regards the seamen, the Government stated thatin accordance with isolated agreements with certain enterprises the navy hadbeen called in as reinforcements to secure free access to work and to protectport installations. There had been no acts of violence but the strike had beendeclared illegal by the labour courts.
.As regards the murder of Mauro Pires in Diadema in  and ofSebastiao Teixeira do Carmo in Mau in July , according to the Government,police investigations have been completed and the files have been handed tothe judiciary.
.As regards the alleged attacks on Jos Barbosa dos Santos, PauloPereira and Oswaldo Cruz, the Government states that the Union of VehicleDrivers, of which these persons are members, issued a statement through itslawyer to the effect that, in the absence of evidence, no measures had beentaken regarding the alleged threats. The Government adds that these events hadnot been entered in the police records.
.Lastly, referring again to the murder of Francisco Alves Mendes, theGovernment states again that the joint action undertaken by the Governor ofthe State of Acre and the federal and military police have made it possible toelucidate the facts and punish the guilty parties. It then reiterates thedetailed information previously given in this respect and adds that a furtherinquiry has been opened with a view to identifying other persons whoparticipated directly or indirectly in this homicide.
.Before broaching the substance of the case, the Committee welcomes thefact that, contrary to what has occurred before, the Government has repliedspecifically to the various allegations pending in this case.
.The Committee regrets, however, as regards the intervention of thearmed forces in order to put an end to strikes in the ports and oilrefineries, that the Government merely states that such activities, involvingas they do the supply of fuel and food, were essential in nature under theterms of the Brazilian law then in force, and that consequently the strike hadbeen declared illegal.
.In this respect, the Committee can only recall that it has alwaysconsidered that a strike is one of the essential means through which workersand their organisations should be able to promote and defend their economicand social claims and that national legislation should not allow suspension orprohibition of the right to strike, except in cases in which interruption ofwork due to a strike would endanger the life, personal safety or health of thewhole or part of the population.
.As regards the allegations concerning alleged attempts on the physicalintegrity of members of the Union of Vehicle Drivers, the Committee notesthat, according to the Government, no files have been opened by the policeconcerning these cases. In these conditions, the Committee considers that thisaspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee greatly deplores the murder of trade union leaders MauroPires in  and Sebastiao Teixeira do Carmo and Francisco Alves Mendes Filho
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to make every effort toguarantee the personal safety of trade union leaders. It also requests it tocommunicate the text of the verdicts handed down against the perpetrators ofthe acts referred to above.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites theGoverning Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee welcomes the fact that, contrary to what has occurredbefore, the Government has furthered the procedure in this case by supplyingdetailed information in reply to the complainants' allegations.b) As regards the intervention of the armed forces in  to disruptstrikes in the ports and oil refineries, the Committee deeply regrets thisaction by the Government which, in its opinion, is contrary to the principlesof freedom of association. The Committee recalls that a strike is one of theessential means through which workers and their organisations should be ableto promote and defend their economic and social claims and that the suspensionof prohibition of the right to strike is only acceptable if the interruptionof work due to a strike would endanger the life, personal safety or health ofthe whole or part of the population.c) As regards the murder of the three union leaders referred to by name bythe complainants, Mauro Pires, Sebastiao Teixeira do Carmo and Francisco AlvesMendes Filho, the Committee greatly deplores the perpetration of such acts andfirmly recalls that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the murderof trade union leaders constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of tradeunion rights. It therefore appeals to the Government to make every effortnecessary to guarantee the personal safety of trade union leaders.d) The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the text ofthe verdicts handed down against the perpetrators of these acts.

.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  June . The ICFTU submitted further allegations in a communcation dated  October . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.The Government has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisation alleges in its communication of  June  that, in order to prevent the seafarers from exercising their right to strike, the Government ordered troops of the Brazilian Navy to occupy all ports and to prevent the strikers from leaving their place of work. When the workers of the Petrobras oil refineries called a one-day work stoppage, the Brazilian army and the federal and military police of several States occupied the refineries with combat vehicles. This situation occurred at a time when the workers had lost  per cent of their purchasing power as a result of the Government's wage policies.
.In its communication of  October , the complainant alleges that Mauro Pires, leader of the Union of Vehicle Drivers and Allied Workers of San Andrs, was murdered on  September ; that trade union leader Jos Barbosa dos Santos was attacked by two individuals who shot at him from a car, though he was unharmed; and that union leader Paulo Pereira received telephone calls threatening",-1,1987,Brazil
79,"his life. A possible explanation of these occurrences is the existence of an armed paramilitary group set up by employers to eliminate the militant members of the Union of Vehicle Drivers and Allied Workers.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the activities carried out by petroleum workers and seafarers have been defined by law as essential services inasmuch as the country depends on them for its supply of fuel and food and that, in the case of seafarers and port workers, their activities are a matter of national security.
.The Government states in the specific case of the Petrobras Company, where there was an ""undeclared"" strike in which the workers remained at their posts and paralysed all activities within the enterprise, the army was called in to protect the enterprise's assets (which are public assets given that Petrobras is a semi-public enterprise) and to guarantee employees' access to their place of work. There were however no incidents involving trade union leaders or strikers.
.As regards the seafarers, the Brazilian Navy was called in to protect port facilities, which are public property, to ensure the flow of supplies to the cities and, again, to guarantee employees' access to their places of work, since separate agreements have been concluded with certain enterprises. Here again, no incidents occurred. The Government points out that the strike was declared illegal by the labour court.
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that strikes which had been called or undertaken in the petroleum sector and in the port and maritime sector were repressed by the military occupation of the plant and facilities concerned.
.The Government claims that these activities were essential and that the intervention of the army and navy was designed to protect the enterprises' plant and facilities, to ensure the flow of supplies to the cities and to guarantee freedom to work. The Committee notes that the legislation in force, and specifically section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  August , provides that, in the interests of national security, the essential services in which strikes are prohibited by the Constitution include petroleum services and loading and unloading of supplies.
.The Committee has stated on numerous occasions (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ) that, as one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests, the right to strike may be denied or subject to major restrictions only in the public service or essential services in the strict sense of the term. It has added that the concept of public servants should be confined to those acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority and that essential services should be interpreted as referring to those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population; otherwise, if the legislation defines the public service or essential services too broadly, the principle whereby the right to strike may be limited or prohibited in those sectors would become meaningless. In the present case, the workers in the petroleum enterprises and those involved in loading and unloading are not public officials in the sense set forth above, nor do they perform an essential service in the strict sense of the term (see, for example, Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, General Survey by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, Report III (Part B), International Labour Conference, th Session, , para. , and rd Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Brazil), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the prohibition of strike action in the petroleum sector and in the ports (loading and unloading sectors) provided for in Legislative Decree No.  of  August  is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations contained in the ICFTU's communication of  October  concerning, inter alia, the assassination of the trade union leader Mauro Pires.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to take steps for the amendment of the legislation in force, and specifically Legislative Decree No.  of  August , so that the list of activities in which strike action is prohibited is confined to essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those whose interruption may endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).b) The Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegations contained in the ICFTU's communication of  October  concerning, inter alia, the assassination of the trade union leader Mauro Pires.",-1,1987,Brazil
80,".The complaints are contained in communications from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  and  August , respectively. The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, (No.), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In its communication of  August , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) alleges that on  July , the police brutally intervened during a strike of sugar-cane workers in the town of Leme (inland in the State of Sao Paulo), in Brazil, resulting in the death of the workers Orlando Correia and Sibely Aparecida Manoel; a further eight workers were shot and many more injured by the police. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) specified, in its communication of  August , that the peasants on strike belonged to the Araras Rural Trade Union, that the police quelled the strike by firing shots and that trade union officials from the CNT, who sympathised with the strikers, were also injured.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that rigorous investigations are under way into the events which occurred in the town of Leme (Sao Paulo) on  July , resulting in the death of Orlando Correia and Sibely Aparecida Manoel, injury to  workers and damage to several vehicles. On the very day of the events, the town's police force opened an investigation, in which the magistrate of the local courts was involved; it has not, however, yet been completed.
.The Government encloses, as an annex, a report from the Disciplinary Adviser of the Sao Paulo State Security Police Force, which may be summarised as follows: - several days before the events occurred, there were several incidents in the town of Leme with sugar-cane cutters, in connection with the strike declared by the Araras Rural Trade Union in the Cresciumal Factory Limited and Cresciumal farming enterprise. This strike was declared illegal by the judicial authorities and the enterprise which had claimed that it was illegal succeeded in obtaining guarantees of safety against the strike pickets for those workers who wished to continue working; - on  July , at . a.m., a picket stoned a bus transporting  workers and  military police, which was escorted by a military police patrol. Immediately after the bus stopped, shots were fired and general confusion prevailed, resulting in two deaths (Orlando Correia - who was passing by the scene of the events - and Sibely Aparecida Manoel - who was at a bus stop in the vicinity) and  injured (Antonio Quirino Lopes, Vctor Nogueira, Valdecir Donizete Rosa, Jorge Aparecido Kilian, Ademir Lirio Generoso Silva, Paulo Honrio Pereira, Jos Carlos Ambrzio, Creusa Aparecida Barbieri Ambrzio, Paulo Afonso Duarte; the military police Winston Jos Tristao, Moacir Vicente Barbiero, Lidio Dal'Olio, Jos Aparecido Vilatol, Eleutrio Martins and Floriano Martins; the federal delegates Jos Genoino Neto (PT) and Djalma de Souza Bom (PT), and the underground railway worker Paulo Otavio de Azevedo Junior). Several vehicles suffered material damage; - the report also refers to a series of inquiries carried out during the investigation and to a hypothesis as to the origin of the shots.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the two deaths, the injuries suffered by  persons and the damage to property, which occurred in the town of Leme on  July , took place when a strike picket stoned a bus with police protection transporting workers who had not joined the strike movement, a situation during which shots were fired and general confusion prevailed.
.On previous occasions, whenever allegations concerning the death or injury of trade unionists or in the event of collective disputes have been sumbitted to it, the Committee has always insisted that a judicial inquiry be carried out with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties. (See, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. .) In this context, the Committee notes that only a police investigation (still under way) was opened concerning the events which occurred in Leme on  July .
.In these circumstances, the Committee deeply deplores the death of Orlando Correia and Sibely Aparecida Manoel and the physical injuries suffered and trusts that a judicial inquiry has been opened.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee deeply deplores the death of Orlando Correia and Sibely Aparecida Manoel and the physical injuries suffered during the sugar-cane workers' strike in Leme on  July .b) It trusts that the Government is carrying out a judicial inquiry into these matters and requests to be kept informed of developments.",-1,1986,Brazil
81,".The complaints were presented by a number of national trade unions: the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Pernambuco (FETAPE), the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of Sao Paulo (FTIC), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) . They were originally submitted to the ILO prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . The Government has since sent information on these cases in communications dated  April and  and  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence committed by employers against workers, trade union activists and union leaders in the sugar cane plantations and alcohol distilleries of several States of Brazil, and specifically in Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, and to the failure of the Government to put a stop to them.
.In the case of the State of Pernambuco in particular, the allegations concern the banning of union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and even the assassination of union leaders or their relations simply for having demanded the implementation or renewal of collective agreements. Moreover, the complainants claim that a situation bordering on slavery and forced labour has developed in these regions, with workers being recruited clandestinely from other parts of the country to break the strikes called by the regular workers belonging to FETAPE.
.The complainants explained that following a general strike in  the , rural workers of the sugar cane growing area secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From  to  other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the labour court and the workers became aware that they could take legal action to have them enforced. As from , however, the employers began to sabotage the agreements by recruiting huge numbers of unemployed labour from the drought-stricken areas of Sertao and Agreste. They got rid of the regular workers and replaced them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from those areas. After the harvest, these workers returned to their home districts and had no way of demanding that their rights be respected before a labour court.
.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation which, after the  elections, relaxed its supervision. In order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers from the Meta area, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or tripling the daily volume of work provided for in the collective agreements. They brought private militia onto the sugar plantations, armed with revolvers and rifles, to ""pay a visit"" on the inhabitants and ""supervise"" the payment of the workers. Some workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; the land was laid waste and turned into cane-fields. The employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the labour standards stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting union dues from their pay. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations and punished workers who, as union delegates, attempted to keep in touch with their union. Some whose names were communicated by CONTAG and the ICFTU received death threats, were locked up in private prisons or were even assassinated, especially in the Goias area.
.In the State of Sao Paulo the FTIC is unable to organise the workers of the state alcohol distilleries and is being prevented from establishing occupational associations that could subsequently become trade uninons. In Gantus , for instance, an agro-industrial enterprise with a distillery in Tupa, the employer has circulated a petition among the staff stating that the workers recognise that the enterprise is well run and rejecting the ""inopportune"" remarks of Pedro GonUales da Silva, a union leader responsible for unionisation in the State of Sao Paulo. The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.
.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country's land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic's solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.
.The Government notes that in May  collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed. It encloses a copy of the agreements between the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo and the Federation of Agricultural Workers, the Sugar Industries' Trade Union and the Alcohol Industries' Trade Union of the State of Sao Paulo. It adds that the Ministry of Labour has decided to set up a special group to enforce the agreements and encloses a copy of the relevant Decree No.  of  March . The Decree specifies that the special group is to be tripartite and must submit its first conclusions and recommendations within  days of the entry into force of the collective agreements. A collective agreement was signed on l September l between the rural workers and sugar cane plantation employers in the East of Pernambuco.
.In addition, on  September  the Ministry of Labour set up a special tripartite committee to examine complaints of infringements of freedom of association made against the Government of Brazil through the ILO. The committee was required to submit its conclusions to the Labour Rights Commission of the Ministry of Labour. The tripartite committee met on  January  and concluded that the facts that had been denounced were of the utmost gravity. They concern the assassination of rural workers, death threats, acts of violence against rural workers and union leaders, the holding of persons in private prisons, the existence of private militias, the practice of torture by the federal police of Goias, attacks and other violations of human rights. The committee concluded that it could not reach any conclusion without concrete information as to whether or not steps had been taken by the competent authorities to deal with each complaint, how far the inquiries had advanced and whether the State Prosecutor's office had been informed. The committee therefore asked the Ministry of Labour's legal adviser to request the Office of the Ministry of Justice for detailed information on each case. Thereafter, on  March , the Minister of Labour requested the Minister of Justice to investigate all the complaints submitted in Case No. . As soon as it has received the necessary information on this case, the committee will be in a position to reach definitive conclusions.
.With respect to Case No. , the regional labour delegation of the State of Sao Paulo has called for an investigation of the matter. This delegation indicated that on  August l the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries accepted that the matter was now closed. The Government attaches to its reply communication No. .-./, signed on  August l by the said Federation, from which it appears that the conflict which had developed at the TUPA-SP enterprise had been resolved.
.The Committee observes that the complaints were submitted prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . Nevertheless, they contain extremely serious allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo and in alcohol distilleries. The allegations refer to the banning of trade union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and the assassination of union leaders.
.The Committee has noted the very specific information submitted by the Government",-1,1985,Brazil
82,"on the subject and, in particular, the creation of two tripartite committees concerning the complaints at issue in the present cases. One of these committees is responsible for ensuring the enforcement of collective agreements, the other with examining the complaints brought before the ILO in the present case. The Committee also notes that two Bills - one dealing with the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations and the other with agrarian reform - are currently being drafted by the national Congress.
.The Committee recalls the very great importance it attaches to respect for human rights as a precondition of respect for trade union rights. It deplores the loss of human life and the very serious acts of violence committed by the employers against unionised workers in the sugar plantations and alcohol distilleries of the State of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo. It regrets the use of temporary workers who are not permitted to join unions in order to prevent the unionised workers from exercising their rights. However, the Committee notes with interest the appointment of a tripartite committee to investigate these extremely serious matters and requests the Government to keep it informed of its findings.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, and in particular the following conclusions:a) The Committee notes that, in view of the extreme seriousness of the allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations and distilleries in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, the new Government has appointed one tripartite committee to investigate the complaints submitted in the present cases and another to ensure the enforcement of the collective agreements in these sectors in the State of Sao Paulo.b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of all the investigations connected with these cases.",-1,1985,Brazil

.In the State of Sao Paulo the FTIC is unable to organise the workers of the state alcohol distilleries and is being prevented from establishing occupational associations that could subsequently become trade uninons. In Gantus , for instance, an agro-industrial enterprise with a distillery in Tupa, the employer has circulated a petition among the staff stating that the workers recognise that the enterprise is well run and rejecting the ""inopportune"" remarks of Pedro GonUales da Silva, a union leader responsible for unionisation in the State of Sao Paulo. The remarks referred to were a call to strike, and workers who did not sign the petition were liable to be placed on a ""black list"". The vast majority of the workers of Gantus therefore signed the petition.
.In its reply the Government states that it has sought clarification from the President of FETAPE and that the instances of violence in the Meta area have now declined considerably, particularly those connected with the exodus of the regular plantation workers. Moreover, disputes between the employers and the regular workers and rural workers' trade union are now confined to specific, localised areas. The situation that had arisen stemmed from the lack of laws and regulations governing labour relations, the disillusionment of the workers with the effectiveness of trade union action and, ultimately, the country's land-ownership structure. The Government is currently drafting two Bills to settle this kind of dispute. One is being prepared by the Ministry of Labour and governs the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations, and the other is designed to implement the President of the Republic's solemn undertaking to undertake an agrarian reform that will bring about a viable and healthy solution to issues of this kind. The Bills are currently before the national Congress.
.The Government notes that in May  collective agreements based on the ""Guariba agreement"" on labour relations in sugar plantations in the State of Sao Paulo were signed. It encloses a copy of the agreements between the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo and the Federation of Agricultural Workers, the Sugar Industries' Trade Union and the Alcohol Industries' Trade Union of the State of Sao Paulo. It adds that the Ministry of Labour has decided to set up a special group to enforce the agreements and encloses a copy of the relevant Decree No.  of  March . The Decree specifies that the special group is to be tripartite and must submit its first conclusions and recommendations within  days of the entry into force of the collective agreements. A collective agreement was signed on l September l between the rural workers and sugar cane plantation employers in the East of Pernambuco.
.In addition, on  September  the Ministry of Labour set up a special tripartite committee to examine complaints of infringements of freedom of association made against the Government of Brazil through the ILO. The committee was required to submit its conclusions to the Labour Rights Commission of the Ministry of Labour. The tripartite committee met on  January  and concluded that the facts that had been denounced were of the utmost gravity. They concern the assassination of rural workers, death threats, acts of violence against rural workers and union leaders, the holding of persons in private prisons, the existence of private militias, the practice of torture by the federal police of Goias, attacks and other violations of human rights. The committee concluded that it could not reach any conclusion without concrete information as to whether or not steps had been taken by the competent authorities to deal with each complaint, how far the inquiries had advanced and whether the State Prosecutor's office had been informed. The committee therefore asked the Ministry of Labour's legal adviser to request the Office of the Ministry of Justice for detailed information on each case. Thereafter, on  March , the Minister of Labour requested the Minister of Justice to investigate all the complaints submitted in Case No. . As soon as it has received the necessary information on this case, the committee will be in a position to reach definitive conclusions.
.With respect to Case No. , the regional labour delegation of the State of Sao Paulo has called for an investigation of the matter. This delegation indicated that on  August l the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries accepted that the matter was now closed. The Government attaches to its reply communication No. .-./, signed on  August l by the said Federation, from which it appears that the conflict which had developed at the TUPA-SP enterprise had been resolved.
.The Committee observes that the complaints were submitted prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . Nevertheless, they contain extremely serious allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo and in alcohol distilleries. The allegations refer to the banning of trade union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and the assassination of union leaders.
.The Committee has noted the very specific information submitted by the Government",-1,1984,Brazil

One of these committees is responsible for ensuring the enforcement of collective agreements, the other with examining the complaints brought before the ILO in the present case. The Committee also notes that two Bills - one dealing with the working conditions of temporary workers in sugar plantations and the other with agrarian reform - are currently being drafted by the national Congress.
.The Committee recalls the very great importance it attaches to respect for human rights as a precondition of respect for trade union rights. It deplores the loss of human life and the very serious acts of violence committed by the employers against unionised workers in the sugar plantations and alcohol distilleries of the State of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo. It regrets the use of temporary workers who are not permitted to join unions in order to prevent the unionised workers from exercising their rights. However, the Committee notes with interest the appointment of a tripartite committee to investigate these extremely serious matters and requests the Government to keep it informed of its findings.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, and in particular the following conclusions:a) The Committee notes that, in view of the extreme seriousness of the allegations concerning acts of violence by employers in sugar plantations and distilleries in the States of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, the new Government has appointed one tripartite committee to investigate the complaints submitted in the present cases and another to ensure the enforcement of the collective agreements in these sectors in the State of Sao Paulo.b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of all the investigations connected with these cases.",-1,1984,Brazil
85,".The complaints were presented by a number of national trade unions: the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Pernambuco (FETAPE), the Federation of Workers of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of Sao Paulo (FTIC), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) . They were originally submitted to the ILO prior to the change in the Brazilian regime in . The Government has since sent information on these cases in communications dated  April and  and  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations in these cases refer to acts of violence committed by employers against workers, trade union activists and union leaders in the sugar cane plantations and alcohol distilleries of several States of Brazil, and specifically in Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, and to the failure of the Government to put a stop to them.
.In the case of the State of Pernambuco in particular, the allegations concern the banning of union leaders from sugar plantations, the hindering of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the interruption of the check-off system for union dues, death threats and even the assassination of union leaders or their relations simply for having demanded the implementation or renewal of collective agreements. Moreover, the complainants claim that a situation bordering on slavery and forced labour has developed in these regions, with workers being recruited clandestinely from other parts of the country to break the strikes called by the regular workers belonging to FETAPE.
.The complainants explained that following a general strike in  the , rural workers of the sugar cane growing area secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From  to  other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the labour court and the workers became aware that they could take legal action to have them enforced. As from , however, the employers began to sabotage the agreements by recruiting huge numbers of unemployed labour from the drought-stricken areas of Sertao and Agreste. They got rid of the regular workers and replaced them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from those areas. After the harvest, these workers returned to their home districts and had no way of demanding that their rights be respected before a labour court.
.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation which, after the  elections, relaxed its supervision. In order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers from the Meta area, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or tripling the daily volume of work provided for in the collective agreements. They brought private militia onto the sugar plantations, armed with revolvers and rifles, to ""pay a visit"" on the inhabitants and ""supervise"" the payment of the workers. Some workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; the land was laid waste and turned into cane-fields. The employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the labour standards stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting union dues from their pay. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations and punished workers who, as union delegates, attempted to keep in touch with their union. Some whose names were communicated by CONTAG and the ICFTU received death threats, were locked up in private prisons or were even assassinated, especially in the Goias area.

.The complaint of the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG) is contained in a communication dated  July .
.In the absence of observations from the Government the Committee was obliged to adjourn examination of this case on three occasions, for the last time at its May  meeting, when it observed with regret that, in spite of the time which had elapsed since the complaint was presented, the information and observations awaited from the Government had not been received. The Committee therefore appealed to the Government to transmit its observations as a matter of urgency, drawing its attention to the fact that, in conformity with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of the Committee's th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report at its next meeting on the substance of this case even if the Government's observations had not been received by that date. (See th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).) The Office has since sent the Government of Brazil a cable, dated  August , to remind it of this urgent appeal.
.Since it has still not received the Government's information and observations on this case, the Committee regrets that the Government has not yet sent them, and in view of the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, it feels obliged to examine the case without taking these observations into account.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG) has submitted a complaint of violation of freedom of association in Brazil on behalf of the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Pernambuco (FETAPE), an organisation which is affiliated with it. The complainants allege that the employers resorted to violence against militant workers in the sugar-cane plantation area of the State of Pernambuco and that the government authorities were ineffective in putting an end to it.
.The complainants explain that in , following a general strike, the , rural workers of the above-mentioned sugar-cane cultivation area had secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops. From  to  other collective agreements were signed under the aegis of the Regional Labour Court, and the workers became aware that they could resort to the labour courts to secure observance of these agreements. Parallel with these developments, the regional labour delegation was at the same time maintaining systematic supervision of the region, in particular keeping checks on clandestine labour and ensuring respect for the rights of the workers enshrined in the law and collective labour agreements.
.In the middle of , however, the employers began to sabotage these agreements by recruiting unemployed labour in the regions affected by the drought which, at the time of the complaint, had been affecting the Sertao and Agreste for five years. They got rid of the regular workers, replacing them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from these regions. This involved no great risk to the employers, explain the complainants, since the workers concerned returned to their administrative districts after the harvest and had no means of upholding their rights before a labour court. The employers also hired temporary workers residing in the administrative districts of the sugar-cane area, but they contrived to employ them in districts far from their homes, so that the union in their workplace was not that of which they were members and could therefore not demand the application of collective agreements before the courts.
.According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation, which relaxed its supervision after the elections towards the end of .
.The complainants explain that, when the various press media gave wide publicity to the campaign launched by the employers to recruit , workers from the semi-arid region for the - harvest, the Rural Workers' Union drew the attention of the Government of the State of Pernambuco to the irresponsibility of the project from the social point of view and to the benefits that it concealed for the employers, since it was obvious that if workers were recruited from the semi-arid zone, this would be to the detriment of the manpower traditionally available on the spot. Its sole aim was to exploit the agricultural workers of the Sertao and Agreste to the maximum, and the union reminded the State Government of its duty to find viable solutions to the problems of these workers in their home areas.
.Although the Secretary of State for Social Welfare of the Government of the State of Pernambuco agreed, and stated his opposition to the employers' project, saying that he would authorise it only if they were first able to guarantee the full employment of the workers of the Meta area, no concrete measures were taken to prevent the manoeuvres of the planters and refinery owners. On the contrary, administrative supervision was relaxed.
.In order to evade responsibility for unjustified dismissals, the employers then resorted to illegal or even brutal manoeuvres. Not content with reducing thousands of organised workers to unemployment, the employers went to the lengths of denying them the payment of the indemnities to which they were entitled by accusing them of leaving their employment or threatening them with physical violence when they wanted to approach the labour courts or their union.
.The complainants also explain that, in order to secure the departure en masse of the regular workers of the Meta zone, the employers suddenly imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or trebling the volume of the daily tasks provided for in the collective agreements. Parallel with this, they brought private armies on to the sugar-cane plantations, composed of hired ruffians armed with revolvers and rifles, whose job it was to ""visit"" the inhabitants and ""supervise"" payment of the workers. At the same time, the workers who had been granted land for their own use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it; their lands were laid waste and transformed into cane-brakes.
.At the same time the employers forbade the workers to mention the trade union and the standards for the tasks stipulated in the collective agreements and ceased deducting from the workers' wages the trade union contributions the latter had authorised. The private militia denied trade union officials access to the plantations, and workers who attempted to complain to the labour courts or who, like the union delegates, remained in contact with their unions, were subjected to exemplary punishment by the militia: they were beaten up or shot in the middle of the night, and threats and even murders were common.
.This was the climate of intimidation and terror that developed in a number of plantations, in particular at Carabas, in the Paudalho administrative district, for which Geraldo Guerra had held the concession since . In this connection, the complainants mention the inspection report of the regional labour delegation for this plantation, dated  November .
.According to this report, out of a payroll of ",-1,1984,Brazil
87,"workers,  were clandestine workers receiving a wage lower than that stipulated in the collective agreement. The report noted that the workload for sugar-cane strippers had doubled (from  to  bundles), that only  of the  regular workers were receiving six days' wages and remuneration for the weekly rest day, whereas the remaining  were receiving less than six days' wages and no remuneration for the weekly rest as a result of the doubling of the workload. Finally, the employer, his steward and the four men accompanying them were armed with rifles and revolvers, according to the inspection report.
.In addition, say the complainants, a -year-old agricultural worker on the same plantation, Antnio Rodriguez dos Santos, who had been living on the estate for over  years and had refused to leave his home and his plot of land, was shot dead by a plantation supervisor on  January . The first official version of the affair spoke of a crime of passion, a later version of an accident with a firearm. As it happened, the victim was related to the President of the Union of Rural Workers of Sao LourenUo da Mata and of the President of the Union of Rural Workers of Paudalho.
.On this plantation, according to the complainants, the employer no longer deducts the workers' trade union contributions, giving as a pretext the need for ""free and spontaneous communication"". Some workers complained to the Limoeira Court and  of them told the court that they had signed their request for cancellation of the check-off under pressure. Following the murder of Rodriguez dos Santos, about  workers appeared before the same court, accompanied by the employer, Geraldo Guerra, and confirmed that they had signed the request for cancellation on their own initiative, after which the workers who had complained to the Paudalho police were taken by the employer, Geraldo Guerra, to the same police station to withdraw their complaint ""spontaneously"".
.Finally, still on the same plantation, controllers of the Institute of Weights and Measures who were making a visit were forced at gunpoint to return the scales and gauges which they had seized on the suspicion that they had been tampered with.
.Similar manoeuvres are also reported from other plantations, including Taquarinha in the administrative district of Maraial, where Jos Ribeiro da Silva holds the concession and where, on  March , an attempt was made on the life of the agricultural worker Antnio Pedro da Silva by the employer's son-in-law, one Renato de Tal, because he had complained to his union, which is a member of the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Pernambuco (FETAPE) about the invasion of his plot of land and the damage done to it.
.Likewise, at Jacunde, in the administrative district of Ferreiros, on the plantation conceded to Jos Barbosa Pereira, an attempt was made on the life of the agricultural worker Jos Francelino Gomes on  March  by the employer, who fired four shots at his house while he and his family were in it. The victim was forced to abandon the harvest of his -hectare plot and to change plantation, thus losing his rights to  days' paid leave and his severance pay.
.Finally, at Arajo, in the administrative district of Sao LourenUo da Mata, on the Bulhoes concession, the union delegate was threatened on  February  by the plantation supervisor who, revolver in hand, set fire to the premises of the union delegation, totally destroying its roof, in order to prevent the workers from meeting there.
.The complainants consider that impunity encourages violence. They denounce the escalation of this violence which, they say, is particularly affecting the administrative districts of Carpina, Lagoa, Itaenga and Paudalho, and the fact that the federal inspectors of the Ministry of Labour and controllers of weights and measures have been prevented at gunpoint from carrying out their tasks.
.They object to the unofficial power of the employers, who use force to back up their claims to flout the law and make attempts on the physical integrity and the lives of the workers, attacking the right to organise guaranteed by the Constitution and making a mockery of the federal supervisory institutions and the labour courts.
.The complainants add that, on  May , they went to see the Governor of the State of Pernambuco to hand him a document denouncing the violence in the Meta area and demanding the adoption of measures to punish the guilty parties. The Governor stated that it was necessary to ensure respect for law and order, and the FETAPE communicated to its council of representatives consisting of  unions the assurances it had received in this connection. However, FETAPE and CONTAG observe with regret the inefficacy of the police investigations conducted since that time, given the bias of the investigators who interpret cases of violence as disputes between workers.
.In conclusion, the complainants demand that the private militias should be disarmed; that the police investigations should be placed in the hands of delegates capable of elucidating the facts in order to establish responsibilities and punish the guilty parties; that the Government should take a clear and unequivocal stand on respect for the rights of the rural workers of the sugar-cane growing area of Pernambuco, and in particular that the regional labour delegation should exercise systematic supervision accompanied by penalties; that the Sugar and Alcohol Institute should supervise the observance of the law respecting plots of land (Decree No. .); and that the federal highway police and the Transport Department should supervise the observance of the highway code.
.The Committee recalls that at its May-June  Session the Governing Body advised the Government that, in conformity with its procedure, it might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting even if the Government's observations had not been received. The Committee has still not received these observations.
.In these circumstances, and before examining the substance of the case, the Committee feels it necessary to recall the considerations set forth in its First Report (paragraph ) which it has had cause to repeat on a number of occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such factual charges as may be put forward.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent a reply; because of the time which has elapsed it is obliged to examine the case without taking account of the Government's observations.
.The Committee observes that this case concerns acts of violence committed by sugar-cane plantation employers in the Meta region of the State of Pernambuco against workers who are only seeking the application of collective labour agreements. In particular, it notes the prohibition by these employers of access by trade union officials to plantations, the obstacles placed in the way of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises, the stoppage of check-offs of trade union contributions demanded in advance by the workers, threats to kill rural workers and relatives of trade union officials which are sometimes even put into practice, and finally acts committed by certain planters against representatives of the public authorities carrying out inspections in these areas.
.It appears from the information furnished by the complainants that the authorities exercised systematic supervision in these areas until the end of , but that since then, despite the good will of the Governor of Pernambuco, certain planters have been behaving in a violent and illegal manner and are no longer subjected to penalties, since according to police investigations on the plantations such acts are allegedly due to disputes between workers.
.Given the extreme seriousness of the allegations, which mention reprisals against workers in the sugar-cane plantations of the Pernambuco region who are simply demanding respect for the rights obtained in collective agreements, the Committee must recall the importance it attaches to the unimpeded exercise of trade union activities.
.It accordingly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee a climate favourable to the exercise of trade union rights by the workers in this area and also requests it to indicate what measures have been taken to restore the trade union situation to normal and secure respect for collective agreements on these plantations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:a) The Committee deeply regrets that, despite the many requests addressed to it, the Government has sent no written information on this complaint presented by the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers of Brazil in July .b) It draws the Government's attention to the fact that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance",-1,1984,Brazil
88,"of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such factual charges as may be put forward.c) Regarding the substance of the case, given the extreme seriousness of the allegations, which mention reprisals against sugar-cane plantation workers in the Pernambuco area who are simply demanding respect for the rights obtained in collective agreements, reprisals which include forbidding trade union officials access to plantations, obstacles placed in the way of trade union activities, burning of trade union premises, the stoppage of check-offs of trade union contributions and threats to kill persons connected with trade union officials which are sometimes put into practice, the Committee must recall the importance it attaches to the unimpeded exercise of trade union activities.d) The Committee accordingly urges the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee a climate favourable to the exercise of trade union rights by the workers in this area and also requests it to indicate what measures it has taken to restore the trade union situation to normal and secure respect for collective agreements on these plantations.",-1,1984,Brazil
89,".The Committee has already examined these complaints on two occasions, in November l (see th Report, paras. -) and in November l (see lst Report, paras. -). Since then the Government has sent its observations in a communication dated  April l.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, l (No.), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, l (No.).
.The complaints arose out of a labour dispute and strike which developed in l- in Belgo Mineira, an iron and steel undertaking in the State of Minas Gerais, which led to the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders, the requisitioning of strikers and the recruitment of workers from outside the undertaking who were underpaid and forbidden to organise. The complaints referred in particular to the management's refusal to renew the collective agreement and its attempt to negotiate with the non-unionised workers.
.According to the complainants:- in May l the enterprise dismissed l workers following the trade unions' refusal in February l to accept a wage cut;- in June the same year the management withdrew the payment of time off for trade union leaders, a right which had been acquired more than  years before;- the management notified the Belgo Mineira Staff Welfare Association that the enterprise intended to cease paying its contributions and cancelled the mainly administrative facilities that it had been granting the trade union since l to ensure the social protection of the staff, despite the fact that such protection is compulsory since the enterprise insists upon it when hiring staff;- it refused to deduct trade union dues from the workers' pay as it had been doing since ll, on the grounds that the cost of doing so would be too high;- in October l it refused to renew the collective agreement and the trade union was obliged to call a strike. Following the court ruling on the dispute and on strike compensation, the enterprise dismissed a number of foremen and strikers;- the management suspended a number of benefits that the staff had acquired and, in order to exhaust the union's financial resources, obliged it to take many cases to court;- the bonus for night work was reduced and payment of the annual  per cent bonus was suspended;- the enterprise initiated legal proceedings against the leaders of the trade union based on information published in the trade union bulletins and used absurd excuses to impose penalties on them;
.According to the Government's replies, the last of which was received on  December l, the labour authorities of the State of Minas Gerais acted as mediators in the dispute. The Government declared that the right to organise and the obligation for employers to negotiate with the corresponding trade union were guaranteed by Brazilian law. It stated that no fewer than seven conciliation meetings had been held to no avail and that, as a result, legal proceedings were brought before the labour court. Furthermore, in l the trade union took the enterprise to court on three counts and the Government recalled that under Brazilian law trade union leaders could not be removed for any reason whatsoever.
.The complainants subsequently alleged in a communication of  December l that pressure had been brought to bear on the workers, who were called in individually by the management to sign an undertaking not to join any trade union, that the management refused to deduct union dues from the workers' pay, that a federal police superintendent had been dismissed by the Minister of Justice for daring to fine the enterprises and that ""blacklists"" had been circulated containing the names of workers who refused to yield to pressure by Belgo Mineira. These workers had allegedly been dismissed and prevented from finding another job. The complainants also explained that the enterprise, which had been negotiating with the complainant union for more than  years, had delegated its bargaining powers to the employers' associations in the iron and steel industry for the negotiation on its behalf of an agreement for this branch of activity within a global bargaining framework, including even small enterprises whose workers were negotiating for the first time; it hoped in this way to provoke a conflict between the workers of small enterprises and those of Belgo Mineira.
.The complainants also pointed out that the Minister of Labour had refused to supply them with copies of the labour inspection reports on the enterprise, although he had promised to do so at a mediation hearing on  July l. The Minister had not applied the sanctions provided for under Legislative Decree No. /. The enterprise was still refusing to deduct trade union dues even though required to do so by court order and the federal police had not solved the case concerning the criminal acts committed against the trade union by the management of Belgo Mineira, although the union lodged its complaint in l.
.In November l, the Committee on Freedom of Association regretted that, despite the time which had elapsed since the complainants' latest allegations, no written information had been received from the Government since December l. It requested the Government to communicate the text of any judicial decisions handed down in respect of the labour dispute and to supply detailed information on developments in the dispute.
.In its reply of  April l, the Government stated that on  October l it contacted Leonardo Diniz Dias, the President of the complainant trade union, who informed it that the situation had improved but was still not altogether satisfactory. No final judgement had yet been handed down on the l- and l- disputes. However, with regard to the matters raised in the latest communication of the complainants, the President of the trade union observed that wages were now paid punctually and that, after two months' interruption, trade union dues were again being deducted from pay. The appropriate deductions were not, however, being made for the cost of pharmaceuticals, ambulances, funeral services and other welfare facilities. According to the President, the situation with respect to the criminal acts against the trade union was unchanged and no federal police file had been opened on the subject.
.On the basis of available information and documents, the Government considers that a copy of the labour inspection report should be communicated to the trade union so that it can, if necessary, take appropriate action to defend the interests of its members and of non-members. It states, however, that Legislative Decree No.  of  December l is not applicable as there has been no delay in the payment of wages. According to the Government, the enterprise decided unilaterally to reduce the working day and cut payment for overtime accordingly, from  to . per cent; it also stopped paying overtime for night work. However, there has been no holding back of wages which continue to be paid punctually, thereby rendering the said Legislative Decree inapplicable in the view of the Government.
.The Government notes further that after two months' interruption union dues are being deducted from pay regularly. The deductions that the enterprise is refusing to make correspond to the cost of benefits which the trade union pays directly or makes available to its members. With regard to the union President's statement that he has taken the case to court, the Government states that the matter has been settled inasmuch as the decision now lies with the judiciary. With respect to the criminal acts committed against the trade union by the management of Belgo Mineira, the Government encloses a copy of a letter of October l sent by the regional labour delegate of Minas Gerais to the regional labour court and regional prosecutor of Minas Gerais following the trade union's denunciation of criminal acts. It does not, however, comment on the matter.
.The Committee observes that the Government has endeavoured to obtain information from the President of the trade union on developments in this labour dispute. The Government does not, on the other hand, appear to have contacted the employer directly with a view to resolving the issue once and for all.
.The Committee notes, nevertheless, that the workers' wages are now being paid on time and that, after two months' interruption, union dues are again being deducted from pay.
.The Committee also observes that a number of appeals are still sub judice.
.The Committee draws the Government's attention to the need to ensure workers and trade union leaders adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and, in particular, to ascertain that no worker or foreman has had to leave the union as a result of direct pressure.
.The Committee recalls in particular the very great importance that it attaches to the right to strike as a legitimate means of defending the workers' interests.
.The Committee requests the Government to ensure that there will be no violations of trade union rights during the labour dispute in the Belgo Mineira company.
.The Committee requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeals that have been brought before",-1,1984,Brazil
90,"the courts and of developments in this labour dispute.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) the Committee draws the Government's attention to the need to ensure workers and trade union leaders adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination.b) The Committee recalls in particular the very great importance that it attaches to the right to strike as a legitimate means of defending the workers' interests.c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that there will be no violations of trade union rights during the labour disputes in the Belgo Mineira company.d) The Committee requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeals that have been brought to court and of developments in the labour dispute that has been going on since l.
.The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting, when it submitted an interim report which was approved by the Governing Body (th Report, paras.  to ). The Government sent certain partial information on this case on  December , and the complainants conveyed additional information in communications of  December  (JAOA Monlevade Union) and  January  (World Confederation of Labour). The Committee noted these developments in its th Report, paragraph , approved by the Governing Body in February . Since then the Office has sent the Government of Brazil two cables dated  April and  August  requesting it to reply to the allegations still pending.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint originated in a labour dispute and strikes which developed in - in Belgo Mineira, an iron and steel undertaking in the State of Minas Gerais, which led to dismissals of workers and trade union leaders, requisitioning of strikers and the recruitment of workers from outside the undertaking who were underpaid and forbidden to organise. The complaint referred in particular to the refusal of the management to renew the collective agreement and to an attempt by the management to negotiate with unorganised workers.
.The Government sent certain information from which it transpired that the regional labour delegation of the State of Minas Gerais and the Secretary for Labour Relations had acted as mediators in the dispute. The Government also stated, in general terms, that the right to organise is guaranteed by Brazilian law. On the other points mentioned above, however, the Government did not communicate concrete items of information in reply to the allegations of the complainants.
.At its November  session the Governing Body therefore approved the following recommendations of the Committee:a) With respect to the allegations concerning the dismissal of workers and trade union officials having taken part in a strike, the requisitioning of strikers, the threats of dismissal against strike pickets and the recruitment of workers at a lower wage accompanied by a ban to join a trade union in order to break a strike, the Committee drew the Government's attention to the dangers inherent in these alleged acts for freedom of association. The Committee also considered that these acts restricted the legitimate exercise of the right to strike. It requested the Government to inform it of measures taken or envisaged towards the reinstatement of the trade unionists who had allegedly been unjustly dismissed and to ensure that Brazilian legislation guaranteeing workers the basic right to join a trade union should be respected.b) Concerning the alleged refusal of the management to renew the collective agreement which had expired in October  and its attempts to negotiate with workers not belonging to a trade union, the Committee recalled the importance it attached to the promotion of collective bargaining with workers' representatives and requested the Government to inform it of the reasons for the employer's refusal to negotiate and also on the developments in this labour dispute.
.In its communication of  December  the Government stated that Brazilian law obliges the employer to negotiate with the appropriate trade union (section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws) and that, despite seven meetings for conciliation purposes at the regional labour delegation of the State of Minas Gerais, no solution had been found enabling the parties to negotiate a new collective agreement; this resulted in the institution of legal proceedings in application of the labour legislation. The Government added that the proceedings were in progress before the labour court. As regards the allegations of dismissal of trade union officials, the Government stated that Brazilian law protects such officials against acts of anti-union discrimination and that, if individual complaints were made and it were shown that trade union officials had been dismissed without committing serious misdemeanours, the courts would order their reinstatement. The Government accordingly requested the Committee on Freedom of Association to declare the case closed.
.In their communications of  December  and  January  the complainants claimed that the Government had remained passive in the face of the violations of freedom of association suffered by the workers of JAOA Monlevade since, when the union asked the Ministry of Labour for the inspection reports on the undertaking in July , the Minister had allegedly replied that he did not intend to take any measures against Belgo Mineira and that, if the union wished to obtain copies of the inspection reports, it would have to take legal action. The complainants also took exception to the fact that the Minister had allegedly not imposed any penalty on the undertaking for persistent delays in the payment of wages, although appeals had been lodged in this connection and Brazilian law empowered him to penalise undertakings in such cases.
.The complainants also repeated their statement to the effect that even though, according to the Government, Brazilian law guarantees the right to organise in the powerful multinational undertaking Belgo Mineira, the management summons the workers individually to force them to sign a letter prepared in advance in which they undertake not to join any trade union on pain of dismissal.
.The complainants also indicated that, although the undertaking is under the obligation to check off trade union contributions from pay slips, it refuses to do so.
.The complainants also affirmed that a superintendent of the federal police of the State of Minas Gerais was dismissed from office by the Minister of Justice for having dared to impose sanctions on undertakings.
.Finally, the complainants claimed that black lists containing the names of workers who had stood up for their rights and had been dismissed were being circulated among employers. In particular, these lists bore the names of about  wage earners who had refused to yield to pressure by Belgo Mineira, had been dismissed and had been victimised when looking for new jobs.
.The complainants attached to their complaint a number of documents in support of their allegations, including a letter of complaint addressed to the regional labour delegate for Minas Gerais on  February , in which the complainant union explained that the Belgo Mineira undertaking abolished the night shift unilaterally and without any consultation with the union, obliging workers to work two shifts and not three and so depriving them of the additional pay for night work which they had been receiving for years and which they regarded as an integral part of their wages.
.The documentation also contains two letters addressed to the Minister of Labour by the complainant union, the first on  January  requesting copies of the labour inspection reports in the undertaking concerned, the second on  October  reminding the Minister that, despite the interview he had granted the union on  July , no measure had yet been taken to remedy the irregularities committed by the undertaking, in particular the pressure exerted on workers to induce them to leave the union and renounce the shift work supplement, which according to the union was a right acquired many years ago, and to force them to refrain from involving the union in the defence of their rights over the abolishment of their night work supplement and the consequent reduction in their paid leave and supplementary social benefits. The letter also mentioned the refusal by the employer, in violation of section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, to negotiate with the union the renewal of the collective agreement which was to enter into force on  October . The letter explained that the undertaking delegated its bargaining powers to the employers' associations in the iron and steel industry for the negotiation in its name of an agreement for this branch of activity within a global bargaining framework including even small undertakings employing three workers, whereas, according to the complainant union, the undertaking had been negotiating directly with it for over  years. Still according to the trade union, the employer wished to provoke a conflict between the workers of small undertakings who were negotiating advantages for the first time and those of Belgo Mineira,",-1,1984,Brazil
91,"who already enjoyed acquired rights and genuine advantages. It also wished to destroy the image of the trade union in the eyes of its members and to provoke clashes between workers. The letter ended by stating that, since the Minister of Labour was aware of the unlawful acts of the undertaking, the union hoped that he would take concrete steps to remedy the irregularities and again requested the Minister to supply copies of the inspection reports.
.The same complaints were transmitted by the complainant union to the President of the Republic in a letter dated  October , copy of which was sent to the ILO by the World Confederation of Labour.
.In the present state of affairs the Committee deeply regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the latest allegations were presented by the complainants in December  and the many requests for a reply to the allegations addressed to it by the ILO, no written information has been received from the Government respecting this labour dispute since December .
.The Committee observes, however, that, according to the same written reply furnished by the Government in December , no solution was found with a view to the renewal of the collective agreement in the Belgo Mineira undertaking and that judicial proceedings had been instituted before the labour courts in application of section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws.
.The Committee notes that section , as amended by Act No.  of  and Legislative Decree No.  of , provides that no industrial association representing economic or occupational categories and no undertaking, even if it is not represented by an industrial association, may refuse to engage in collective bargaining, that in the event of a refusal to negotiate the industrial associations and undertakings concerned must inform the regional office of the Ministry of Labour so that a summons may be served on the industrial association or undertaking refusing to bargain, and that, in the event of persistent refusal to negotiate by ignoring the summons served by the regional office of the Ministry of Labour or where the negotiations fail, the industrial association or undertaking concerned may commence a collective dispute. Finally, where a collective agreement, collective contract or binding award is in force, it is not permissible to commence a collective dispute more than  days before its expiry and any new text is to take effect from the date of such expiry.
.In the present case the Committee has been informed neither by the Government nor by the complainants of any settlement that may have been reached in this dispute since December , despite the many conciliation meetings held at the regional labour delegation. Nevertheless, the Committee observes that Brazilian law imposes a time limit for the adoption of a decision to commence a collective dispute in the event of refusal by an employer to bargain. In the present case, according to the Government's own statements, judicial proceedings were instituted before December  before the labour courts. The Committee trusts that this labour dispute has since been settled.
.The Committee therefore requests the Government to communicate any judicial decision handed down in respect of this labour dispute, and to supply detailed information on the manner in which it has developed.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:a) The Committee deeply regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the complainants' latest allegations in December  and the many requests for a reply addressed to it by the ILO, no written information has been received from the Government since December .b) The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of any judicial decision handed down in respect of the labour dispute between the JAOA Monlevade Metalworkers' Union and the iron and steel undertaking Belgo Mineira, and to supply detailed information on the way in which this dispute has developed.
.The Joo Monlevade Metalworkers' Union submitted a complaint of violation of freedom of association against the Government of Brazil in communications dated  March,  May,  and  June . The Unitarian Workers' Federation associated itself with this complaint in a communication of  May , as did the World Confederation of Labour in communications dated  June and  August . For its part, the Government sent a partial reply on this case in a letter dated  August .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants explain that, in the past, it was possible to settle labour disputes through collective bargaining in the iron and steel undertaking, Belgo Mineira, a subsidiary of a multinational enterprise of which the headquarters is in Luxembourg and which is represented in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy; however, in , there was severe social tension within the undertaking. The management adopted a very hard line during discussions on the renewal of the collective labour agreement. It refused to discuss the trade union proposals and then went on to dismiss  workers in May , claiming that these dismissals were the direct outcome of the trade union's uncompromising stand. However, the complainants explain, in February , the management had proposed that the trade union accept wage cuts of  per cent, in spite of the fact that annual inflation was as high as  per cent; the trade union had refused this proposal, since the undertaking had just increased its dividends.Furthermore, in June , the management had withdrawn the payment of time off for trade union leaders, whereas this right had been acquired by the trade union for more than  years. It had also refused to deduct trade union dues from the workers' pay slips on the pretext that this operation would be costly.
.The complainants state that the workers retaliated by taking strike action on  October  and that the labour court had refused, on  October , to declare it illegal as requested by the management. In addition, the court had also ordered the undertaking to fulfil some union claims, but the dismissed workers were not reinstated and most of the trade union claims were not satisfied. In spite of this, the workers went back to work.
.Several weeks later, the management started putting pressure once again on the workers. In some sectors, for example, additional pay for night work, established by collective agreement, was simply abolished. The workers lodged a complaint with the labour court, but the management summoned them individually to force them to sign a declaration in which they agreed to withdraw their complaint and give up the additional pay for night work. Few workers yielded to this pressure. The management used the same coercive methods when it decided to increase tenfold the price of meals. Meanwhile, the works canteen was closed and its staff dismissed. Furthermore, contrary to signed agreements providing for a minimum wage upon recruitment, the undertaking started to hire new workers for a wage three times less than that stipulated in the collective agreements, provided that they did not join the trade union, which even Brazilian labour legislation does not authorise. Finally, various measures were aimed personally at officials of the metalworkers' union, such as transfer, removal to a lower position and even dismissal. Two of those concerned lodged a complaint with the labour court and won their case. According to the complainants, this list is not complete.
.Whilst these incidents were taking place, the Metalworkers' Union of Monlevade convened a general assembly on  January , when it was decided to initiate the procedure for calling a strike.A later general assembly was to be convened to decide, in accordance with the strike legislation, to give the order to strike; however, the second assembly was not convened immediately because, the trade union still wished to give the negotiations a chance to succeed. Finally, the date of the strike was fixed for  March ; meanwhile, however, the tension had become so great that, on  February , the workers spontaneously stopped work. The management immediately gave notice of  new dismissals. The Metalworkers' Union maintained that these were workers who had participated in the strike action. The management then ordered the engineers and foremen to go and requisition workers at their homes and to threaten them with dismissal if they refused to start work again. The wives of those workers who were not at home were forced to accompany them in the car to go and look for them. However, these attempts failed.
.In view of the strong pressure brought to bear by the management, it was decided that the strike pickets would remain in their place day and night to supervise the entrances to the factory.The management responded to this decision by stepping up its pressure even more. It ordered the foremen to intimidate members of the workers' families unceasingly. Cars patrolled at  a.m. and those workers",-1,1984,Brazil
92,"who refused to be picked up were to be dismissed forthwith.The management placed loudspeakers at the factory entrances to call out the strike pickets by their name and threatened them with dismissal. Finally,  workers yielded to this pressure. They were escorted by the police to the undertaking where they had to remain for  hours.
.According to the complainants, on  February, representatives from the Ministry of Labour made an attempt at conciliating the parties to the dispute. The management of Belgo Mineira denied that it had threatened the workers and refused to open discussions with the Metalworkers' Union before an end to the strike was called. The representative of the Ministry of Labour then suggested that the union should resume work under two conditions. that coercive measures should cease within the undertaking and that an inquiry should be carried out by the labour inspectorate concerning violations of legislation, regulations and collective agreements in force in the undertaking. The trade union accepted this proposal and work began again on  March. However, the management did not stop harassing the workers and the Metalworkers' Union of Monlevade, as proved by later developments:- only an urgent appeal from the Federal State Governor enabled the trade union to avoid  new dismissals on the very day that work was resumed;- at present, the management claims that it no longer wishes to discuss with the trade union representatives, but only with a delegation of workers that it intends setting up itself;- the management is attempting to pursuade the engineers and foremen to make statements incriminating the trade union. The statements are then submitted to the judicial authorities, with whom a complaint has been lodged to try and have the strike from  February to  March  declared illegal;- the foremen belonging to the trade union are being subjected to pressure so that they give up their membership: they are sent a preprinted letter of notice, of which one copy must be sent to the trade union and the other to the undertaking;- the management is attempting to hinder the labour inspectorate's inquiry: it has sent a telegram threatening the officials concerned and has put pressure on workers to prevent them from making any statement.
.In concluding, the complainants point out that in January and February , the local radio station went to great lengths to discredit the trade union. They therefore request the ILO to use the means at its disposal to require that in Brazil the management of this undertaking adopts a more respectful approach towards freedom of association and that it renounces its policy of confrontation with the trade union and its attempts to get rid of it.
.Furthermore, the Unitarian Workers' Federation refers especially to the fact that several trade unions have been placed under official supervision following the strike action of June ; this has been examined within the framework of Case No. . [See paragraphs  to  of the present report.]
.In its reply of  August , the Government states that the regional labour delegation of the State of Minas Gerais, acting upon the complaint of the trade union in question and upon the request of the Labour Relations Secretariat of the Ministry of Labour, went to the undertaking itself to try and bring the parties to make mutual concessions and persuade them to resume discussions and return to the negotiating table.
.The Labour Relations Secretariat is continuing its activities along these lines, with a view to bringing about the reconciliation of the opposing parties, adds the Government. Indeed, thanks to this governmental inquiry, some situations have been normalised and others have been clarified.
.The Government points out that issues pertaining to labour law and the adherence to collective agreements fall within the competence of the judiciary, as long as the collective agreements are in force. It points out that when these agreements expire, the management of undertakings may, as no new collective agreement has been signed, do away with some of the advantages provided for in the previous agreement. For instance, in the present case, paid time off for trade union officials was abolished in view of the fact that under section , paragraph , of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, any period for which an employee absents himself from work for the performance of trade union duties is treated as unpaid leave, unless the employer gives permission or the case is covered by a clause in the contract. The Government also points out that the right to join or not to join a trade union is free in Brazil. Therefore, a worker may not be prevented from exercising his right. Indeed, in accordance with section , paragraph , of the above-mentioned Act, any undertaking endeavouring in any manner to prevent an employee from joining or forming an industrial association or from exercising his rights as a member of such an association is liable to penalties and the employee may be entitled to compensation.
.With respect to the check-off of trade union dues, this must be carried out by the employer once it has been authorised by the employees. Inquiries are at present being made to ascertain whether the undertaking failed to make these deductions and whether this was at the employer's instigation.
.In concluding, according to the Government, the Ministry of Labour is committed to encouraging discussions between the parties, a requirement of the utmost importance in settling the present issue.
.The Committee notes that the labour dispute in the iron and steel undertaking of Minas Gerais, Belgo Mineira, seems to have taken place in three stages. In the beginning, the management allegedly.- dismissed  workers in the month of May , after having proposed to the trade union, in February , considerable cuts in their wages at a time when the undertaking was increasing its dividends;- did away with the payment of time off, whereas this right had been acquired for more than  years;- refused to deduct trade union dues from workers' pay slips, on the pretext that this would be a costly operation;- refused to renew the collective agreement which expired in the month of October .During the second stage of the dispute, as retaliation against the legal protest strike declared by the workers as from  October , the management allegedly.- abolished the payment of overtime for night work in some sectors and brought pressure to bear on the workers concerned to prevent them from lodging a complaint;- recruited new workers at a lower wage, forbidding them to join the trade union;- transferred or dismissed trade union officials;- dismissed  workers, at the beginning of , who had allegedly taken part in the strike;- requisitioned striking workers and threatened to dismiss the strike pickets;- brought pressure to bear on the engineers and foremen so that they give up their trade union membership.During a third stage, faced with a new strike from  February to  March , the management allegedly tried to have it declared illegal and to negotiate with workers not belonging to the trade union, excluding trade union representatives. At the same time, it allegedly hindered the work of the labour inspector who had been sent on the spot to make inquiries..The Committee notes that the Government does not deny the development of this labour dispute. On the contrary, it states that it attempted to set itself up as mediator to help the parties in reaching a solution. The Committee notes the Government's explanations concerning the non-payment of time off for trade union activities. It also notes the Government's assurance that no one, under Brazilian law, may be deprived of his right to join a trade union. It also notes that the employer must deduct trade union dues from the workers' pay slips if the trade union has requested this and that the Government is attempting to ascertain if Brazilian law in this respect has been infringed.

.The Committee nevertheless notes with regret that the Government does not provide any information on several grievances raised by the complainants, in particular the dismissal of workers having taken part in strike action and of union officials, the requisitioning of strikers and threats of dismissal against strike pickets, the recruitment of new workers at a lower wage and bans on trade union membership. With respect to these various allegations, the Committee draws the Government's attention",-1,1984,Brazil
93,"to the dangers inherent in these alleged acts for freedom of association. It also considers that these acts restrict the legitimate exercise of the right to strike. It therefore insists that the requisitioning of strikers, the threats of dismissal of strike pickets, the recruitment of underpaid workers and bans on joining a trade union in order to break up lawful and peaceful strikes in services which are not essential in the strict sense of the term, which is the case of the iron and steel industry, are not in accordance with freedom of association. The Committee therefore requests the Government to inform it of measures taken or envisaged to bring about the reinstatement of workers and trade union officials unduly dismissed and to ensure that Brazilian legislation guaranteeing workers the right to join a trade union is respected.
.Finally, the Committee, in view of the alleged refusal of the management to renew the collective agreement and its attempts to negotiate with workers not belonging to a union, whilst excluding the workers' representatives, recalls the importance it attaches to the fact that the development of procedural rules agreed upon between employers' and workers' organisations should be encouraged and that measures should be taken to promote voluntary collective bargaining with workers' representatives. The Committee stresses, of course, that these measures should not be drawn up or applied in such a way as to encroach upon the freedom of collective bargaining. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to communicate information on the reasons for the employers' refusal to negotiate and on the developments in this labour dispute.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) With respect to the allegations concerning the dismissal of workers and trade union officials having taken part in a strike, the requisitioning of strikers, the threats of dismissal against strike pickets and the recruitment of workers at a lower wage accompanied by a ban to join a trade union in order to break a strike, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the dangers inherent in these alleged acts for freedom of association. The Committee also considers that these acts restricted the legitimate exercise of the right to strike. It requests, in particular, the Government to inform it of measures taken or envisaged towards the reinstatement of the workers and officials who had allegedly been unjustly dismissed and to ensure that Brazilian legislation guaranteeing workers the basic right to join a trade union should be respected.(b) Concerning the alleged refusal of the management of the iron and steel undertaking, Belgo Mineira, to renew the collective agreement which expired in October  and its attempts to negotiate with workers not belonging to a trade union, the Committee, recalling the importance it attaches to the fact that measures should be taken to promote voluntary collective bargaining with workers' representatives, requests the Government to inform it of the reasons for the employers' refusal to negotiate and also on the developments in this labour dispute.",-1,1984,Brazil
94,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural and Allied Workers (IFPAAW) submitted a complaint of violations of freedom of association Conventions Nos.  and  in a communication of  October . Subsequently, the IFPAAW supplied additional information in support of the complaint in communications dated  January and  February . The Government presented its observations in a communication of  January .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU and IFPAAW indicate that on  August  Margarida Maria Alves was murdered while standing with her son in front of her residence, receiving several bullets in the head fired by three individuals who had alighted from a car. She was at that time President of the Union of Rural Workers of Alagoa Grande (State of Paraba, in north-eastern Brazil), of which she had been one of the founders in . The complainants emphasise in their communications that this State is a sugar-growing region in which for many years workers have lived in absolute poverty and have been deprived of the most elementary rights. It is stated in the complaint that at the time of the murder of its President, the Union was preparing a campaign of various demands concerning, in particular, the provision of minimum working conditions such as payment of a minimum wage, an eight-hour work day, payment of overtime, annual leave, etc. The complainants point out that a political group called ""Grupo da Vrzea"" composed of sugar-cane plantation owners had strongly opposed the workers' trade union. According to the inhabitants of Paraba, this group was already responsible for the murder in  of a president of the Union of Rural Workers, Mr. Joao Pedro Teixeira. As in the case of other trade union leaders of the region, Margarida Maria Alves is reported to have received death threats if she continued her activity in defence of workers in sugar plantations, threats stemming in particular from plantation owners. The complainant organisations allege that the murder of the President is, so far as the plantation owners are concerned, a further attempt to intimidate workers in the sugar plantations in north-eastern Brazil in their struggle for justice.
.In its communications of last January and February, the IFPAAW submits information from the Centre for Rural Workers' Education and Culture (CENTRU), of which the murdered President was one of the founder members and the director. This information concerns not only the facts but also the holding of the inquiry and emphasises in particular the predominance of the IFPAAW's trade union activities in the campaign in defence of workers' rights, in which other trade unions are associated; it also provides details concerning the activities of the employers, that is to say the sugar plantation owners.
.This information contains an account of the following developments: after four months' inquiry, Gilberto da Rosa, delegated by the judicial authorities to carry out an investigation into the murder of Margarida Maria Alves, disclosed to the press the names of the President's three killers who, according to him, were acting on behalf of the landowner Antnio Rgis. This assertion, contained in the CENTRU information bulletin annexed to the IFPAAW's letter of January , is followed by information concerning Antnio Rgis himself and the ""Grupo da Vrzea"". This major landowner, known to the inhabitants of the region in particular for his violence and his authoritarianism, is alleged to be a member of the organisation composed of landowners of the Vrzea region called ""Grupo da Vrzea"", a group which, it is claimed, exercises political domination over various State and Federation Parliamentarians. According to the CENTRU publication, the Secretary for Security, Dr. Fernando Milanez, was appointed to his post in accordance with instructions given by this group.
.The second IFPAAW letter dated February last contains a CENTRU communication providing additional information. The activities of the Alagoa Grande trade union and of Margarida Maria Alves are described in greater detail. First, it is pointed out that the campaign in defence of workers' rights is being conducted by  rural workers' trade unions, by the Federation of Agricultural Workers (FETAG) and by the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG). The principal objectives of this campaign launched in the State of Paraba are to secure a work card, annual payment of an extra month's wages, annual leave, an eight-hour work day, etc. It is stated that a small number of rural workers in the State of Paraba enjoy these basic rights but that about , workers are deprived of them. The Alagoa Grande trade union is considered as playing a leading role in this campaign among the  trade unions of the Brejo region. It appears from the CENTRU communication that the union activities were directed above all against the major landowners and that they were followed by threats on the life of union leaders, in particular, Margarida Maria Alves. According to the CENTRU statement, the Brejo region is politically dominated by the Vrzea group, allegedly the most reactionary from the political standpoint in the State of Paraba. According to the actual words of the inhabitants of the region, the members of this group are as a rule murderers and are responsible for the murder in  of Pedro Teixeira, president of a peasants' league in a town near Alagoa Grande. In its communication CENTRU refers to a statement by the member of Parliament Acio Pereira, brother-in-law of Aguinaldo Veloso Borges, a sugar-processing factory owner and president of the Grupo da Vrzea, which he reportedly made to the press following the President's death and in which he disputed the claim that Margarida Maria Alves was executed on the orders of a political group which she refused to support, attempting to bring accusations of murder against the ""Workers' Party"" (PT) and the ""Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement"" (PMOB) in order to demonstrate the innocence of the group of which his relative is the leader.
.In its communication of  January , the Government supplies information concerning the murder of Margarida Maria Alves as well as the inquiry which was conducted subsequently. It attaches to its communication copies of decisions of the police delegation concerning the inquiry and press cuttings describing in chronological order events relating to the holding of the inquiry. The Government indicates that the murder of Margarida Maria Alves at  p.m. on  August  was a tragedy which shook public opinion, principally on account of the perverse elements which characterised it. The following day, in view of the seriousness of the facts and the difficulty in elucidating them, Dr. Rimondo Milanez, Secretary for Public Security, suggested to the State Governor that he should request the Court of Justice of the State of Paraba to constitute a judicial commission to investigate the affair. The Court, meeting in plenary session on  August, rejected the request by  votes to two, on the grounds that the crime had not disturbed law and order. The Governor then appointed Mr. Gilberto Indrusiak da Rosa as special representative to carry out an inquiry into the crime. In the course of his inquiry, the representative requested, on  September , that a group of seven gypsies, on whom certain suspicions rested, be remanded into custody. Subsequently, charges against this group of gypsies were dropped but other evidence enabled charges to be brought against Amauri Jos do Rego, Amaro (or Mario) Jos do Rego (his brother) and a third person known by the name of ""Toinho"". At the same time, the group of gypsies previously charged was released. Consequently, on  December , the head of the inquiry, Mr. Gilberto Indrusiak da Rosa, presented proof of the guilt of the persons remanded in custody at his instigation, the three suspects Amauri Jos do Rego, Amaro Jos do Rego and ""Toinho"" as perpetrators of the crime, and also a fourth person (Marcos Antnio Coutinho Rgis), as having planned it. According to the press cuttings communicated by the Government, the murderers received a sum of , cruzeiros for murdering the trade union President.
.First, the Committee deeply deplores the tragic murder in August  of Mrs. Margarida Maria Alves, President of the Union of Rural Workers of Alagoa Grande, State of Paraba, who was shot down in cold blood in front of her residence by three individuals who had alighted from a car.
.The Committee notes that according to the information communicated by the complainant organisations, at the time of the tragedy the trade union, of which the victim was not only the President but also one of the founders, was preparing with  other unions to present claims against the major landowners in the sugar-growing region of Brejo, as part of a broader campaign in defence of workers' rights, in which  rural unions of the State of Paraba are participating. As a result, the President as well as other",-1,1983,Brazil
95,"trade union leaders had received threats on their lives, and the aim of this tragedy was allegedly to break up the campaign to put forward claims and the trade union itself.
.While noting that an inquiry was conducted by the judicial authorities and led to the arrest of three culprits who, according to the information provided by all. the parties, acted on behalf of Marcos Antnio Coutinho Rgis, who was also charged in this affair, the Committee points out that no mention was made of the judicial proceedings which should follow. The Committee urges the Government to communicate information concerning action taken after these charges were made and in particular to supply the texts of the judgments, together with the reasons adduced therefore, as soon as they have been handed down in the case against these four persons.
.Furthermore, the Committee must recall that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee emphasises that in the present case the allegations of the complainant organisations concerning the political character of the ""Grupo da Vrzea"" and its criminal dealings are of a sufficiently serious nature and appear to ascribe to this group of employers an authority and power over workers which are incompatible with the harmonious development of labour-management relations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the tragic murder of Margarida Maria Alves, President of the Union of Rural Workers of Alagoa Grande, which shook public opinion and struck a serious blow against the campaign in defence of the rights of workers employed in sugar-cane plantations and against the trade union itself.(b) While noting that an inquiry led to charges being made against three perpetrators of the crime and their organiser, a member of the ""Grupo da Vrzea"", a political group of plantation owners employing rural workers in the region, the Committee requests the Government to communicate information concerning action taken following the charges made against the four criminals.(c) The Committee further urges that stringent measures to combat the violent dealings of such groups of employers as well as provisions to protect the free exercise of trade union rights be adopted without delay.(d) The Committee requests the Government to communicate a copy of the judgments, together with the reasons adduced therefore, as soon as they have been handed down.",-1,1983,Brazil
96,".The Committee examined this case at its February  meeting, when it submitted an interim report which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, February-March . [See rd Report, paras.  to .] The Government subsequently sent certain information in a communication dated  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with interest that the administrative supervision of the trade unions which are the subject of the complaint has been lifted, with the exception of that applying to the Union of Employees of Bank Establishments of Sao Paulo, in respect of which the competent authorities are carrying out an audit, and that, according to the Government, no one has been dismissed for strike activities. The Committee also notes that elections are under way for the unions where the supervision has been abolished. The Committee recalls that it had requested the Government to reinstate the trade union leaders in their posts. It accordingly requests the Government to ensure that the trade union leaders in question have the possibility of being re-elected to their posts.
.With regard to the auditing of the accounts of the Union of Employees of Bank Establishments of Sao Paulo, the Committee again points out, as it has done on many occasions in the past, that, although legislative provisions requiring submission to the authorities of annual financial statements and other data on points that may not seem clear in these statements do not in themselves infringe the financial autonomy of trade unions, measures of supervision over the administration of trade unions such as audits and inquiries should be applied only in exceptional cases when justified by grave circumstances (for example, presumed irregularities in the annual statement or complaints from members of the organisation) so as to avoid the danger of intervention by the authorities which might hinder the exercise of the right of unions to organise their administration in full freedom. [See, in particular, rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), paras.  and .]
.In the present case, while the auditing of the accounts of the Union of Employees of Bank Establishments of Sao Paulo is being carried out this union has been placed under the supervision of the federal authorities because its leaders took part in the general strike of  July . The Committee, therefore, considers that the audit of the union's accounts had wider implications. It accordingly urges the Government to ensure that this supervision is accompanied by certain guarantees against interference by the authorities, and in particular that the official appointed to carry out the supervision is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities. The Committee hopes that the administrative supervision of this union will be brought to an end in the near future.
.The Committee notes with interest the assurances given by the Government concerning the amendment of the trade union laws, including the provisions on the right to strike. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these amendments will bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association and asks the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions.(a) The Committee notes with interest that the administrative supervision of four of the five trade unions forming the subject of the complaint has been lifted and that elections relating to these unions are under way. The Committee again requests the Government to ensure that the trade union leaders of the unions in question have the possibility of being re-elected in their posts.b) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that the auditing of the accounts of the Union of Employees of Bank Establishments of Sao Paulo which is currently being carried out by the authorities while this union is still under administrative supervision, is completed as soon as possible and is accompanied a by certain guarantees and, in particular, that the official appointed to carry out the audit is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities. The Committee would again express the hope that the administrative supervision of this union will be brought to an end in the near future.(c) The Committee expresses the firm hope that the amendments to the trade union legislation, including provisions on the right to strike, that are under consideration by the Government, will bring this legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It wishes to remind the Government that the ILO remains at the disposal of all the parties concerned to provide them with any assistance that may contribute to the preparation of future legislation with a view to ensuring a situation that is in conformity with the standards and principles of the international Labour Organisation concerning freedom of association. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this matter.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  August . The ICFTU sent additional information in a communication dated  August . The Government replied in a communication dated  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU alleges that on  July  the trade unions of the state undertaking ""Petrobras"" of the Paulinia (Campinas) and Mataripe (Baha) oil refineries began a strike to obtain better social and economic conditions. The strike led the Federal Government to decree its intervention in the trade unions in the respective refineries and it proceeded to dismiss the trade union leaders and replace them by an administrative comptroller. At the same time and in an arbitrary manner  workers of the Paulinia refinery and  from the Mataripe refinery were dismissed. The ICFTU goes on to say that on the same date the Metallurgical Workers' Trade Union of Sao Bernardo do Campo also went on strike in support of better economic and social conditions. The authorities reacted in the same way as with the oil workers' trade unions; the union leaders were dismissed and are now being prosecuted and the trade union is being supervised by an official of the Federal Government. Lastly, the ICFTU alleges that the situation, which is compounded by the problems resulting from the economic policy of the Government, led to the decision by numerous trade unions to call a general strike which took place on  July; immediately afterwards the Minister of Labour decreed the Federal Government's intervention in the Bankworkers' Trade Union of Sao Paulo and the Underground Transport Workers' Trade Union of Sao Paulo.
.The Government states that the oil, banking and transportation services are amongst those which are considered essential under Legislative Decree No.  of  August , which prohibits strikes in such sectors. This prohibition is included in the Federal Constitution which at the same time as it guarantees Brazilian workers the right to strike also establishes some restrictions to this right in section , which stipulates that ""strikes shall not be permitted in the public services nor in essential activities which shall be laid down by law"". The Government adds that any trade union leader who supports or encourages a strike movement in the public services or essential activities is subject to the sanctions of warning, suspension, dismissal or loss of mandate (section  of the above-mentioned Legislative Decree). The Government adds that employees who participate in a strike in the public services or essential activities are committing a serious offence and in such cases the following sanctions may be applied by the undertaking concerned: warning, up to  days' suspension, cancellation of the employment contract with dismissal for just cause (section  of the Legislative Decree).
.The Government also states that pursuant to the legal provisions mentioned above and it having been shown that the leaders of the trade unions of the ""Workers of the Oil Distillation and Refining Industry of the State of Baha"", the ""Workers of the Oil Distillation and Refining Industry of Campinas and Paulinia"" (State of Sao Paulo), the ""Employees of Bank Establishments of Sao Paulo"" (State of Sao Paulo) and the ""Workers of the Metropolitan Transport Undertakings of Sao Paulo"" (State of Sao Paulo) supported and encouraged a strike movement, these leaders were dismissed from their trade union positions.
.In the case of the Trade Union of Metallurgical, Mechanical and Electrical Workers of Sao Bernardo and Diadema, the strike which was declared by this organisation infringed not only the legal provisions contained in Act No. / but also, and it is important to draw attention to this, recent standard-setting instruments.
.The Government concludes by saying that the interventions were not therefore the result of the simple exercise of the right to strike, but occurred because the",-1,1983,Brazil
97,"latter had been exercised without respect of the statutes in force, principally in essential services in which strikes are prohibited.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the complainant has alleged various acts of anti-trade union discrimination and the application of measures of intervention in five trade unions as a result of the strikes held during the month of July  in the oil, metallurgical, banking and metropolitan transport sectors.
.As regards the strikes held in the oil, banking and metropolitan transport undertakings, the Committee notes that according to the Government, in pursuance of Legislative Decree No.  of  August , the activities of the oil, banking and transport services are considered essential activities in which strikes are prohibited. The legislation stipulates that trade union leaders who encourage or support strikes in these sectors may be penalised by dismissal or loss of their trade union mandate and workers who participate in such strikes may be dismissed.
.The Committee has pointed out on many occasions (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Honduras), para. ) that, as one of the essential means whereby workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests, the right to strike may be prohibited or seriously restricted only in public services or essential services in the strict sense of the term; that the concept of public servant should be confined to those acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority and that essential services should be interpreted as referring to those whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population; otherwise, if legislation defines the public service or essential services too broadly, the principle whereby the right to strike may be limited or prohibited in those sectors would become meaningless. In the present case, the workers of oil, banking and metropolitan transport undertakings are not public officials in the sense set forth above, nor do they perform an essential service in the strict sense of the term [see, for example, General Survey by the Committee of Experts on the Applications of Conventions and Recommendations, (Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining), ILC, th Session, , Report III, (Part B), para. , st Report of the Committee, Case No.  (Poland), para.  and th Report, Cases Nos.  and  (Sri Lanka), para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the prohibition of strike action in the oil, banking and metropolitan transport sectors contained in Legislative Decree No.  on  August  is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.Consequently, and in view of the fact that the complainant has stressed that the objectives pursued by the strikes held in the oil, banking and metropolitan transport sectors in the month of July  were consistent with the promotion and defence of the occupational interests of the workers, the Committee requests the Government to take measures as soon as possible with a view to lifting its intervention in various trade union organisations (Union of Workers of the Oil Distillation and Refining Industry of the State of Baha; Union of Workers of the Oil Distillation and Refining Industry of Campinas and Paulinia; Union of Employees of Banking Establishments of Sao Paulo and the Union of Workers of the Metropolitan Transport Undertakings of Sao Paulo), to re-establishing the trade union leaders of these organisations in their trade union posts, as well as to reinstate such leaders and the workers dismissed for strike action in their jobs. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken to this effect. Finally, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the need to amend its legislation, in particular Legislative Decree No.  dated  August , so as to ensure that the list of activities in which strike action is prohibited is limited to essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.As regards the alleged anti-trade union measures taken as a result of the strike held by the Trade Union of Metallurgical, Mechanical and Electrical Workers of Sao Paulo, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this strike was not only an infringement of Act No. / but also of recent standard-setting instruments. The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the provisions which have been infringed and to explain in what way there was infringement so that the Committee may examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee requests the Government to take measures as soon as possible with a view to lifting its intervention in four organisations of the oil, banking and metropolitan transport sectors; to re-establish the trade union leaders of these organisations in their trade union posts; and to reinstate such leaders and the workers dismissed for strike action in their jobs. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of all measures taken to this end.(b) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the need to amend its legislation, in particular Legislative Decree No.  of  August , so as to ensure that the list of activities in which strikes are prohibited is limited to essential services in the strict sense of the term (those whose interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population).(c) As regards the alleged anti-trade union measures taken as a result of the strike held by the Trade Union of Metallurgical, Mechanical and Electrical Workers of Sao Paulo, the Committee notes that according to the Government, the holding of this strike was not only an infringement of Act No. / but also of recent standard-setting instruments. The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the provisions which have been infringed and to explain how they were infringed so that the Committee may examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts.",-1,1983,Brazil
98,".The Committee has already examined this case presented by the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), at its March  meeting, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. (See th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March )). At subsequent sessions the Committee adjourned the case pending the receipt of comments from the Government and the outcome of the court proceedings. In a communication of  October  the Government stated that the preliminary hearing was entering its final phase; at its November  meeting the Committee therefore requested the Government to keep it informed of the outcome. Subsequently, CONTAG sent additional information dated  January  and the Government communicated information on  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations under examination began with the murder on  July  of the President of the Rural Workers' Trade Union (STR) of Brasilia, Wilson Souza Pinheiro, at the union's headquarters in Brasilia, in the State of Acre. On  July a demonstration of rural workers aimed at defending their rights and protesting against the murders and the acts of violence and injustice committed by large landowners was held in Brasilia in solidarity with the murdered man's family, and culminated with the death of the landowner Nilo Srgio de Oliveira. The authorities accordingly instituted proceedings in the Twelfth Military Judicial Constituency in Manaus, in the State of Amazonas, against Francisco da Silva, President of CONTAG, Joao Maia da Silva Filho, trade union delegate of CONTAG for Acre and Randnia, the union officials Luis Incio da Silva and Jac Bittar, and the adviser Francisco Mendes, on the grounds of incitement to collective breach of the law and/or fomenting violent discord between the classes of society, indictments which under the National Security Act can carry a sentence of up to  years' imprisonment. In its complaint of  April  and its letter of  July  providing additional information CONTAG pointed out that, at their trial, the president and regional delegate of CONTAG had acknowledged that they were in Brasilia on  July  to protest against the murder of union leader Wilson Souza Pinheiro, but had denied any responsibility for the death of the landowner Nilo Srgio de Oliveira. The complainant added that the Military Council had rejected the public prosecutor's request for the preventive detention of the defendants.
.In its reply of  November  the Government stated that, acccording to the Office of the Military Prosecutor, the two CONTAG officials were liable to the penalties prescribed in section , subsections (ii) and (iv) and sole paragraph of the National Security Act (incitement ... (ii) to collective breach of the law ...; (iv) to fomenting violent discord between the classes of society ...; sole paragraph: when such incitement leads to serious bodily injury or death""). The Government stated that, during the public demonstration over the murder of the president of the STR of Brasilia, these officials had incited the other participants to vengeance, breach of the law and fomenting discord between the classes of society; it stated that the landowner who had been murdered at the end of the demonstration had been held responsible for the death of Wilson Souza Pinheiro.
.In these circumstances, as regards the judicial proceedings against the trade union leaders Jos Francisco da Silva, Joao Maia da Silva Filho, Luis Incio da Silva and Jac Bittar, accused of violating section  of the National Security Act, the Committee, in view of the divergencies between the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply, and noting that a trial was in progress, had merely been able to express its concern at the severity of the sentences faced by the union leaders and requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgment of the military judicial authorities.
.In its communication of  January  CONTAG announced that the trial of Jos Francisco da Silva, Joao Maia da Silva Filho, Francisco Alves Mendes Filho, Luis Incio da Silva and Jac Bittar, accused of offences against national security, would be held on  March . According to the complainant the evidence produced during the preliminary hearing was insufficient to enable the accused to be sentenced, since it was obvious that they had committed no offence against national security. It points out that the National Security Act in force at the time of the events (Act No.  of  December ) was replaced by a new National Security Act (Act No.  of  December ) which specialists consider to be more flexible. The complainant organisation remarks that the penalties prescribed by the new Act are lighter and that incitement to collective breach of the law, one of the grounds on which the proceedings were instituted, is not regarded as an ""offence against national security"".
.In its letter of  May  the Government states that the trade unionists Jos Francisco da Silva, Joao Maia da Silva Filho, Luis Incio da Silva (""Lula"") and Jac Bittar, tried by the Twelfth Military Judicial Constituency in Manaus, have been found not guilty of the charges brought against them by virtue of s. A of the Code of Military Criminal Procedure which stipulates: ""the Council of Justice shall acquit the accused ... once it has been verified that: (a) there is proof that the act was not committed or no proof that it was committed"". According to the Government, Jos Francisco da Silva has returned to his functions as President of CONTAG, Luis Incio da Silva is President of the Workers' Party, Jac Bittar is a member of the latter and Joao Maia da Silva Filho is working in the Labour Secretariat in the State of Acre.
.According to information made available to the Committee, the trial of the trade union leaders Jos Francisco da Silva, Joao. Maia da Silva Filho, Francisco Mendes, Luis Incio da Silva and Jac Bittar, accused of having contravened section  of the National Security Act, was scheduled for  March  and the Committee notes that at that trial four of these trade unionists were acquitted by virtue of s.A of the Code of Military Criminal Procedure. It also notes that they are presently carrying out their trade union functions or working in the labour administration. The Committee observes, however, that no mention is made in the Government's reply of Francisco Mendes and accordingly requests the Government to confirm that this adviser was also acquitted and to inform it of his present situation.
.The Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judgment rendered by the military judicial authorities with the reasons adduced therefore.
.The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG) presented its complaint in a letter dated  April . CONTAG supplied additional information on  July . The Government replied in a communication dated  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  April and  July , the complainant alleges that proceedings had been instigated in the Twelfth Military Judicial Constituency in Manaus in which Jos Francisco da Silva, president of CONTAG, Joao Maia da Silva Filho, trade union delegate of CONTAG for Acre and Randnia, Luis Incio da Silva and Jac Bittar, union leaders, and Francisco Mendes, adviser, have been accused of inciting to collective disobedience of the law and/or violent struggle between social classes, indictments which under the National Security Act can carry a sentence of up to  Years' imprisonment. The complainant claims that the defendants' activities were not criminal but were entirely compatible with the exercise of their trade union rights and that they were accused on  February  only because they had stood by their fellow workers and encouraged them to take joint action to defend their rights and protest against the murders and acts of violence and injustice perpetrated by the big landowners and land-grabbers against the rural workers of Brazil and their leaders.
.The complainant adds that the excuse which the security bodies used this time to undermine the trade union movement - in the person of the president and delegate for Acre of CONTAG - was the death of Nilo Srgio de Oliveira, a land-grabber, which was brought about on  July  by a group of workers infuriated by the murder of the president, of the Rural Workers' Trade Union (STR) of Brasilia, Wilson Souza Pinheiro, at the union's headquarters on  July .
.In its communication dated  July , CONTAG states that, at their trial, the president and regional delegate of CONTAG acknowledged that they were in Brasilia on  July  to protest against the murder of union leader Wilson Souza Pinheiro, but denied any responsibility in the death of Nilo",-1,1981,Brazil
99,"Srgio de Oliveira. The complainant adds that the Military Council rejected the public prosecutor's request for the preventive detention of the defendants.
.In the documentation attached to its communication, CONTAG also cites a considerable number of trade union organisations and representatives of other sectors which have expressed their support of CONTAG in various ways and request that the union leaders concerned be acquitted.
.In its communication dated  November , the Government states that Jos Francisco da Silva and Joao Maia da Silva Filho were indicted by the Office of the Military Prosecutor under section , sections II and IV and sole paragraph, of the National Security Pct (""Inciting ... II - to collective disobedience of the law IV - to violent struggle between social classes Sole paragraph: when such incitement leads to serious bodily injury or death"").
.The Government adds that on  July , after attending a meeting of the Workers' Party in Rio Branco (capital of the State of Acre), the defendants went on to Brasilia where they took part in a public demonstration over the death of Wilson Souza Pinheiro, the president of the STR in Brasilia, who had been murdered on  July . During this demonstration, they incited the other participants to vengeance, disobedience of the law and violent struggle between social classes. Following the demonstration, continues the Government, Nilo Srgio de Oliveira, thought by many to be responsible for the death of Wilson Souza Pinheiro, was murdered.
.Finally, the Government states that the incident has nothing to do with any persecution connected with labour matters, that no threat whatsoever was made against the life and freedom of the defendants, who have in fact been able to continue exercising their trade union functions, and that the court case is still at the judicial investigation stage pending a decision in the matter.
.The Committee notes that this complaint relates to the trial in the Twelfth Military Judicial Constituency in Manaus of the union leaders Jos Francisco da Silva, Joao Maia da Silva Filho, Luis Incio da Silva and Jac Bittar, who are accused of incitement to collective disobedience of the law and violent struggle between social classes, indictments which under section  of the National Security Act can carry a sentence of up to  years' imprisonment.
.The Committee observes that, according to the complainant, the defendants' activities were not criminal but were entirely compatible with the exercise of their trade union duties, whereas the Government states that, in the course of the public demonstration held in Brasilia on  July  over the death of Wilson Souza Pinheiro, the president of the STR in Brasilia, who had been murdered a week before, the defendants incited the other participants to vengeance, disobedience of the law and violent struggle between social classes and that after the demonstration Nilo Srgio de Oliveira, thought by many to be responsible for the death of Wilson Souza Pinheiro, was murdered.
.The Committee further notes that the military juridical authority rejected the public prosecutor's request for the preventive detention of the defendants and that the latter have been able to continue exercising their trade union functions as before.
.In these circumstances, and particularly in view of the divergences between the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply as to the legitimacy of the union leaders' activities during the demonstration held in Brasilia on  July  for the death of union leader Wilson Souza Pinheiro and since the judicial proceedings concerning the said leaders are still under way, the Committee feels obliged to express its concern at the severity of the sentences which the union leaders face. It requests the Government to communicate the text of the judgment of the military judicial authorities, with the reasons adduced therefore, and express the hope that the judgement will fully take into account the principles of freedom of association.",-1,1981,Brazil
100,".The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Brazil in a communication dated  March . The Government replied on  February .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCOTP denounces the suspension of the activities of three teachers' trade union organisations in the State of Rio de Janeiro proclaimed by Decree No.   of  August .
.The complainant organisation explains that under this. Decree its affiliated organisation received the order to close its premises and that the legal personality of the State Teachers Centre (CEP) which combines the following three organisations: the State Association of Teachers of Rio de Janeiro (SEPRJ), the Union of Teachers (of the primary sector) of Rio de Janeiro (UPRJ) and the Association of Teachers of the State of Rio de Janeiro (APERJ), was rescinded.
.The complainant organisation also communicates a memorandum of the Confederation of Teachers of Brazil (CPB) giving a detailed account of the reasons underlying the Government's action. It further specifies that, since the Decree was promulgated, the CPB, supported by the WCOTP and its affiliated organisation tried several times in vain to have the Government's decision rescinded in the name of the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.
.In the memorandum attached to the complaint, the Confederation of Teachers of Brazil (CPB) explains that state school teachers in the State and municipality of Rio de Janeiro have no statutes regulating their profession and that the civil service statutes which apply to them are inadequate.
.Describing the school situation, they explain that the reform resulting from Decree No. / providing free education in primary-level schools made it necessary to recruit teachers for the last four years of that level. After following up-grading courses, primary-school teachers had to teach in secondary schools but continued to be officially regarded as primary school teachers. As their public servants' salaries were inadequate, most of them sought additional work or gave private lessons in private schools in order to meet their own needs overwork led to a deterioration in the quality of their work.
.A group of teachers therefore began to meet in Rio in  to discuss these questions and also proposals relating to the drawing up of a Functions Classification Scheme in the state of Rio de Janeiro. That is how the State Association of Teachers of Rio De Janeiro (SEPRJ) was formed in October  the general assembly at the Sao Bento College voted for a proposed salary claim which was transmitted to the government authorities, who in turn promised to transmit it to the State Governor, but no reply was received.
.Thus, when in February , the Functions Classification Scheme was published, laying down, according to the complainants, unrealistic salary increases, excluding thousands of contract employees and accompanied by communications indicating that each teacher would have his number of teaching hours increased by  or , to  periods, dissatisfaction was complete.
.The teachers met in a general assembly on  March  and decided to call a strike after a memorandum containing their claims had been sent to the State Governor. It included the salary demands mentioned above and other claims relating to working hours, benefits (extended to periods of leave and sick leave) to be granted to those who work in inconveniently located schools and to those contract staff nominated in accordance with their qualifications, and rules governing the working conditions of contract teachers.
.Faced with the Government's negative reply on all points of the memorandum, the general assembly of  March  voted to strike until such time as their claims were met. The strike lasted two weeks since, although the strike had been declared illegal, the authorities recognised the justice of the claims and signed an official undertaking. They proposed to extend this undertaking to all the claims. This related to the new salary levels proposed and provided for them to be paid retroactively. The general assembly therefore decided to resume work. When the plan was adopted, a series of Committees was set up responsible for examining all the claims within  days on  April, the teachers' general assembly agreed to wait for the result of the work of these Committees.
.However, in July  the deadlines fixed by the Government expired. In May and June the Government had several times let it be understood that there were no funds to meet the teachers' claims and it was publicly announced that a loan would be raised.
.The teachers learned through the press that the authorised loan would be made available by the Central Bank and that consequently they would probably not receive the new salary levels until January . These declarations began to create a climate of insecurity when, in July, the payment of two steps as provided for by the previous Government's plan and rejected by the teachers' assembly was announced. Furthermore, the promised retroactive payment was hardly different from the increases provided for by the previous plan.
.Consequently, on  July  the teachers' general assembly noted that the benefits were not yet regulated by decree, but decided not to resume the struggle and to wait for a reply from the Government. Although the Government did make rules governing the benefits, the assembly noted on  July that major claims had not been met, namely the retroactive payment of the new scales, the Committee responsible for the situation of unemployed teachers, the rules relating to contract teachers and the classification scheme providing for the training of teacher trainers.
.A strike was again called in August and the Government showed itself intransigent, stating that all that could be done had been done and that the teachers were already receiving the new salaries. These statements were accompanied by threats that repressive measures would be taken. In fact eight teachers were suspended and an administrative and police inquiry was instituted against them under the law on national security. Prison sentences were passed, more than  teachers were summoned by the political and social police, all the civil servants at the Secretariat of Education had their salaries suspended, general assemblies were forbidden and police were stationed in premises used for meetings and in schools.
.However, thanks to the intervention of several federal members of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Justice gave as assurance that if the teachers resumed work the above-mentioned sanctions would be lifted. On the basis of this promise, the general assembly decided on  August  to call off the strike. Since then the penalties have been stepped up and some teachers have even been sent back from their original teaching establishment to other municipalities, the memorandum concludes.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that the President of the Republic did, in fact, suspend the activities of the associations in question by Decree No. . of  August , at the request of the Governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro and by virtue of article  of the Federal Constitution and Legislative Decree No.  of  August , the latter forbidding strikes in the public services and in activities essential for the maintenance of national security.
.In this complaint the Committee has before it cases of suspension of the trade union activities of three teachers' organisations by a decision of the President of the Republic and allegations of persecution against certain members of the teaching profession for taking part in strikes in the context of occupational claims.
.As regards the suspension of the activities of three trade union organisations by an administrative ruling, the Committee must emphasise the great importance it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations should not be suspended or dissolved by administrative decision. Dissolution by the Executive under a decree giving it full powers, like administrative dissolution, does not permit of the exercise of the rights of defence which can be guaranteed only by normal judicial procedure, a procedure which the Committee regards as essential. In these circumstances the Committee considers it necessary that the legal personality of the occupational associations of the teachers of the state of Rio de Janeiro, which has been suspended, should be restored. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take the measures necessary to this effect and to keep it informed of the measures so taken.
.As regards the labour dispute between the teachers of the state of Rio de Janeiro and the state and municipal authorities, and which led the workers to call a strike, first in March and then in August , the Committee notes that the Government makes no observation on the background of the case and states only that strikes in the public services and activities essential for the maintenance of national security are forbidden under legislative Decree No.  of  August . It emerges from the detailed information provided by the complainant that the repression experienced by the",-1,1981,Brazil
101,"teachers originated in their participation in the strikes which were called as a result of the failure of the collective bargaining in which they were engaged with the public authorities.
.On this question of the teachers' right to strike, the Committee has repeatedly pointed out that the right of workers and their organisations to strike is generally acknowledged to be a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests and that, where this right is restricted or prohibited in the public service or essential services, adequate guarantees should be given to protect the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests. The Committee has also indicated that restrictions should be compensated for by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards should be binding in all cases on both parties; once made, such awards should be fully and promptly implemented. Furthermore, the Committee considers it useful to recall that under the terms of Convention No.  concerning conditions of employment in the public service, adopted by the International Labour Conference in  (Article ) ""measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment between the public authorities concerned and public employees' organisations, or of such other methods as will allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of these matters"".
.In this case, it appears from the information provided by the complainants on the negotiations which started before the strike that their claims were not met, since the Government has not replied on these points. In these circumstances, it is difficult to determine whether the workers and their organisations have enjoyed the guarantees aimed at compensating for the prohibition on the right to strike. The Committee generally considers that recourse to procedures of conciliation and arbitration would have helped considerably in preventing the conflict and creating more favourable conditions for the development of labour relations.
.The Committee also feels bound to point out, as it has in other cases, that arrests of and sanctions against strikers involve serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. Moreover, as on other occasions, it holds the view that an inflexible attitude in the application of severe penalties to workers for going on strike can impair the development of labour relations. The Committee notes that, in the present case, the work stoppages were relatively short and that the information supplied by the Government does not mention any acts of violence or other such infringements of law and order committed by the strikers. In view of these considerations and those expressed in the previous paragraph, the Committee considers it desirable that steps should be taken to re-examine the situation of the sanctioned workers.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) The Committee recalls the great importance which it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations shall not be dissolved by administrative authority. The Committee therefore considers that the Government should take measures to restore the legal personality of the Rio de Janeiro teachers' associations which were suspended by administrative decision, and requests the Government to take the measures necessary to this effect and to keep it informed of the measures so taken.(b) The Committee further brings to the Government's attention the importance which it attaches to the fact that compensatory guarantees, such as adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, should be granted to public service workers who are deprived of the right to strike.(c) Concerning the arrests of and sanctions inflicted on the strikers, the Committee also brings to the Government's attention the fact that such measures involve serious risks of abuse and threats to freedom of association and suggests to the Government that, in view of all these considerations, measures should be taken to re-examine the situation of the workers who were sanctioned. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of measures taken in this direction.",-1,1981,Brazil
102,".The complaints are contained in communications of the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees and the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  and  September , respectively. The Government replied in a communication dated  February .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  August , Mr. Jos Antonio Nania, Vice-President of the San Pablo Hospital Employees' Association, was notified that his contract of employment was terminated ""without due grounds"".
.According to the complainants, despite the mention of ""without due grounds"" in the notice of termination, this measure was really taken because of Mr. Nania's participation, as representative of his association, in a meeting held by the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees last July in Lima.
.In its communication of  February  the Government states that section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws provides that track unions may not be formed by government employees or employees of quasi-governmental institutions, thus expressly excluding public employees from the right to organise. The Government also states that Mr. Nania's status as a public employee debarred him from the exercise of trade union activities as a leader, such as participation in the trade union meeting held in Lima, which he attended without the prior authorisation of the competent authority.
.The Government further states that the dismissal of Mr. Nania was due above all to repeated neglect of his duties, which he justified by the assistance he was lending to the San Pablo Hospital Employees' Association. It adds that Mr. Nania's post did not entitle him to trade union immunity or to the temporary job security which is granted to trade union leaders under the Consolidation of Labour Laws.
.While noting that the dismissal of Mr. Nania was due to repeated neglect of his duties, the Committee observes that the notice of dismissal expressly states that the dismissal was made ""without due grounds"" and that the notice is dated  August . The Committee further observes that the legislation excludes public employees from the right to organise and hence to carry on trade union activities and grants special protection against dismissal only to trade union leaders who are not public employees.
.The Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that exclusion of any category of workers - with the exception of the armed forces and the police - from the right to organise is contrary to the principles of freedom of association and that, in accordance with the provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Brazil, the safeguards provided for by the Convention, in particular protection against acts of anti-union discrimination such as dismissal, must be extended also to persons employed by the State or in the public sector who do not act as agents of the public authority. The Committee draws attention to the fact that the same position has for many years been taken by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In view of the different treatment established by the legislation in trade union matters for persons who are public employees and for those who are not, the Committee does not rule out the possibility that the trade union function and activities of Mr. Nania may have had a decisive influence in his dismissal. The Committee also considers that a harmonious development of labour relations and freedom of action by occupational organisations would be advanced if Mr. Nania were to be reinstated in his former job and requests the Government to consider the possibility of taking steps to this end.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee requests the Government to consider the possibility of taking steps for the reinstatement of Mr. Nania in his employment.The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the right to organise should apply to all public servants and that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should also be extended to persons employed by the State or in the public sector who do not act as agents of the public authority.",-1,1980,Brazil
103,".The Committee already examined this case on Several occasions, the most recent being its May  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, the Government has sent a communication dated  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints in this case were lodged by the three international trade union confederations ICFTU, WCL and WFTU and by the National Labour Front of Brazil and the International Metalworkers Federation and, more recently, by the CPUSTAL. The case relates to a strike called from  April to  May  by the Sao Paulo metalworkers in connection with a labour dispute. The strike was declared illegal and suppressed by the authorities. According to the complainants, the trade union leaders were removed from office and replaced by civil servants. Moreover, some of them, including Luis Inacio da Silva, were arrested and sentenced under the National Security Act. The case was examined by the Committee several times. Those examinations showed that the trade union leader Luis Inacio da Silva and other leaders had been sentenced to imprisonment for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws. They had appealed against the court's decision and had been released pending the judgement on appeal; however, on  November  the accused had again been sentenced by the Military Court of Sao Paulo to between two and three-and-a-half years' imprisonment. Two trade unionists had been acquitted for lack of evidence against them. In its communication of  March , the Government stated that the trade union leaders sentenced to imprisonment were at liberty and had appealed again against the sentences to the Higher Military Court.
.According to information received, it appeared that a Brazilian court of appeal had quashed the sentences, stating that the military court which had pronounced them was not competent to hear the case and that all proceedings against the trade union leaders were terminated.
.Consequently, at its May  meeting, the Committee noted that, on two occasions, the leaders of the metalworkers' union had, under section  of Act No. / respecting the security of the State, been condemned to heavy prison sentences for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws whereas in actual fact they had merely taken part in a workers' movement resulting in a peaceful strike in April-May  to secure wage increases and job security for one year. The Committee noted that the leaders concerned had appealed against the judgements and were at liberty, and requested the Government to confirm that all proceedings against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders were now concluded.
.The Committee also requested the Government again for information on the allegations to which it had not yet replied (arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, removal of trade union leaders from office and their replacement by civil servants, physical assaults perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises on  April  resulting in injuries to dozens of persons, the ban on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest for several hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike and numerous dismissals - , according to the complainants - said to have taken place two days after the strike).
.In its reply of  October , the Government states that, on  April , the Higher Military Court referred the case of Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders to the federal court of the State of Sao Paulo. It attaches the court's decision quashing the previous sentence on the ground of incompetence of the military court, stating that no crime had been committed against national security although there were grounds for considering that a criminal offence under ordinary law had been committed.
.On the other aspects of the case, the Government states that there is no record of any case of arbitrary dissolution of a trade union, that there were no physical assaults against workers and that if any one was injured during disturbances, whether created by strikes or not, this occurred despite the efforts made and warnings given to prevent such occurrences since the intervention or mere presence of the police was limited to a strict minimum. According to the Government, labour relations in Brazil have been extremely calm for the last three years. It also states that the holding of trade union meetings does not require police authorisation and consequently such meetings could not have been banned by the police. Lastly, it explains that in the metalworking sector of Greater Sao Paulo, in which roughly , workers are employed, the turnover of labour is usually about  per cent annually.
.The Committee notes the Government's denials regarding the allegation that trade unions were arbitrarily dissolved during the labour disputes in the metalworking sector in Sao Paulo in April . It notes however that the Government has not refuted the complainants' allegation that trade union leaders were removed from office following the dispute and replaced by civil servants.
.on this point, the Committee requests the Government to state whether the metalworkers' trade unions in the Sao Paulo area which took part in the strike in April  have since been placed under government supervision and are now managed by civil servants who have replaced the trade union leaders. Should this be the case, the Committee trusts that the Government will lift these measures without delay.
.As regards the physical assaults said to have been perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises on  April  and the injuries said to have been caused to dozens of workers, the Committee notes the Government's explanations that no physical assaults took place, that police intervention was limited to a minimum and that any injuries caused occurred despite the efforts made and warnings given to prevent such occurrences.
.The Committee can only deplore that workers were injured during this labour dispute. It stresses the importance which it attaches to the need to limit the intervention of the police force strictly to the maintenance of law and order.
.Regarding the , dismissals which the complainants allege to have taken place only two days after the strike, the Committee notes the Government's explanations about the normal turnover of labour in the metalworking sector of Greater Sao Paulo of the order of  per cent annually for the , workers employed in this industry. The Committee notes, however, that the Government has not refuted the allegation.
.The Committee recalls that when examining previous cases of a similar nature it has pointed out that, while it obviously does not fall within its competence to decide on the desirability of resorting to dismissals for economic reasons, acts of anti-union discrimination should not take place using such circumstances as a pretext. It has also pointed out that protection against anti-union discrimination is of special importance for workers' representatives. In cases where dismissals are alleged to have taken place because of trade union activities, the Committee has also considered it necessary to ascertain whether workers are ensured, by legislation or other measures, effective protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. . In the present case, the Committee notes that section () of the Brazilian Labour Code penalises an employer found guilty of anti-union discrimination against workers exercising their trade union rights. However, the Committee also considers that the existence of legal provisions prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination, while necessary, is insufficient unless they are accompanied by effective procedures, especially preventive procedures designed to prevent such acts. The Committee trusts that the Government will take the necessary measures for securing the reinstatement of any trade union leaders and militants dismissed for having taken part in the strike in the metalworking sector in Sao Paulo in , in order to create a climate that is more favourable for the development of sound labour relations.
.Lastly, as regards the case against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders who are now at liberty, which was referred to the federal court of the State of Sao Paulo, the Committee can only recall once again the importance which it attaches to the right to strike as one of the essential means that must be available to workers and their organisations for promoting and defending their occupational interests. It requests the Government to transmit the decision of the federal court of Sao Paulo as soon as it is handed down.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee requests the Government to state whether the Sao Paulo metalworkers' trade unions involved in the strike in April  have been placed under government supervision and have since then been managed by civil servants replacing the leaders removed from office. Should that be the case, the",-1,1980,Brazil
104,"Committee trusts that the Government will lift these measures without delay.(b) Regarding the physical assaults said to have been perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises and the injuries they are said to have suffered during clashes with the police, the Committee notes the Government's assurances that these events occurred despite the efforts made and warnings given to prevent them. The Committee can only deplore that workers were injured during this labour dispute. It recalls that the use of the police force should be limited strictly to the maintenance of law and order.(c) Regarding the alleged dismissals of , workers two days after the strike, the Committee notes the Government's explanations about the turnover of labour of the order of  per cent annually in this sector. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not denied the allegation. The Committee invites the Government to take the necessary measures for securing the reinstatement of any trade union leaders and militants dismissed following the strike in April , in order to create a climate that is more favourable for the development of sound labour relations.(d) Regarding the case referred to the federal court of the State of Sao Paulo concerning Luis Inacio da Silva and other trade union leaders who are now at liberty, the Committee, while recalling again the importance which it attaches to the right to strike as one of the essential means that must be available to workers and their organisations for promoting and defending their occupational interests, requests the Government to transmit the decision of the federal court as soon as it is handed down.
.The Committee already examined this case at its meetings in February, May and November  when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body. Since then, the Government has sent a communication dated  March  and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) has sent a telegram dated  April  concerning this case.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints in this case were lodged by the three: international trade union Confederations ICFTU, WCL and WFTU and by the National Labour Front of Brazil and the International Metalworkers' Federation and, more recently, by the CPUSTAL. The case relates to a strike called from  April to  May  by the: Sao Paulo metalworkers in connection with a labour dispute. The strike was declared illegal and suppressed by the authorities. The trade union leaders were removed from office and replaced by civil servants. Moreover, some of them, including Luis Inacio da Silva, were arrested and sentenced under the National Security Act. The case was therefore examined by the Committee several times. Those examinations showed that the trade union leader Luis Inacio da Silva and other leaders had been sentenced to imprisonment for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws. They had immediately appealed against the court's decision and had been released pending the judgement on appeal.
.When the case was last examined in November , the Government stated that the Higher Military Court had accepted the plea for annulment submitted by the convicted trade union leaders, had declared the trial null and void and had referred the proceedings back to the court which originally heard the case.
.In its interim conclusions the Committee recalled that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes, asked the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the trial and requested it for a copy of the judgement handed down. It also asked the Government for its observations on the other allegations to which it had not yet replied (arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers at the union's headquarters on  April  resulting in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and , dismissals said to have taken place two days after the strike).
.Since then, the Government has, in a reply dated  March , stated that, at a second hearing, the Military Court of Sao Paulo handed down its judgement against Luis Inacio da Silva and others on  November , again condemning the accused to the following prison sentences:- Luis Inacio da Silva to three years and six months;- Emilio Simoes de Moura to three years and six months;- Djalma de Souza Bom to three years;- Rubens Teodoro de Arruda to three years;- Juracy Batista Magalhaes to three years;- Jos Maria de Almeida to two years and six months;- Manoel Anisio Gomez to two years and six months;- Gilson Luis Correia de Menezes to two years and six months;- Osma Santos Mendona to two years;- Nelson Campanholo to two years;- Wagner Luis Alves to two years.The trade unionists Jos Cicote and Timteo da Silva were again acquitted for lack of evidence against them. The Government adds that the trade union leaders sentenced to imprisonment are at liberty since they have appealed against the sentences to a higher court..For its part, the CPUSTAL, in a telegram dated  April , has denounced the infringements of trade union freedoms committed by the Government of Brazil, in particular the prison sentences inflicted on Luis Inacio da Silva and other trade union leaders for having exercised their legitimate rights.
.For its part, the CPUSTAL, in a telegram dated  April , has denounced the infringements of trade union freedoms committed by the Government of Brazil, in particular the prison sentences inflicted on Luis Inacio da Silva and other trade union leaders for having exercised their legitimate rights.
.However, according to information received, it appears that a Brazilian Court of Appeal overturned the sentences, stating that the Military Court which had decided them was not competent to hear the matter.
.The Committee notes that, on two occasions, the leaders of the metalworkers' union have, under section  of Act No. / respecting the security of the State, been condemned to heavy prison sentences for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws whereas in actual fact they had merely taken part in a workers', movement resulting in a peaceful strike in April-May  to secure wage increases and job security for one year. The Committee also notes that the leaders concerned have appealed against the judgements, are at liberty, and that a Brazilian Court of Appeal has apparently overturned the judicial decision, stating that the Military Court which had decided the matter was not competent.
.The Committee further recalls that the consequences of the strike led the Government to intervene in trade union affairs and to remove trade union leaders from office and replace them by civil servants.
.Furthermore, according to the allegations before the Committee, physical assaults were perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises on  April , agricultural workers who had come to support the metalworkers were arrested, and , persons were dismissed.
.As regards the prison sentences pronounced against  trade union leaders of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo, including Luis Inacio da Silva, for having taken part in a strike in April-May , the Committee once again recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations for promoting and defending their occupational interests. The Committee requests the Government to confirm that all proceedings against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders have now concluded.
.As regards the other allegations to which the Government has not yet replied, the Committee again requests it for its observations concerning the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority following the dispute, the physical assaults said to have been perpetrated against workers at their union's headquarters on  April , and the dismissal of , strikers following the dispute.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) regarding the prison sentences pronounced by the Military Court at the second hearing against  trade union leaders of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo, including Luis Inacio da Silva, for having taken part in a peaceful strike declared illegal by the authorities, the Committee notes that the leaders concerned have appealed and are at liberty. As it has been informed that a Brazilian Court of Appeal has apparently overturned the judicial decision, stating that the Military Court which had decided it was not competent to hear the matter, the Committee requests the Government to confirm that all proceedings against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders have now been concluded.(b) the Committee again requests the Government for information on the allegations to which it has not yet replied: arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, removal of trade union leaders",-1,1980,Brazil
105,"from office and their replacement by civil servants, physical assaults on workers in front of their union's premises on  April resulting in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April, the arrest for several hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which were said to have taken place two days after the strike.
.The Committee examined this case at its February and May  Sessions and presented an interim report to the Governing Body on both occasions. Subsequently, the Committee has received a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  August . The Government has supplied certain observations in a communication dated  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations referred to the strike by the workers of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo from  April to  May , the primary purpose of which was to obtain wage increases and continuity of employment for a year, and which was declared illegal by the judicial authorities on  April , and to the events which occurred during and after the strike: intervention by the authorities in trade unions, removal from office of trade union leaders and their replacement by civil servants, arrests of trade union leaders and the prosecution and sentencing under the National Security Act of the trade union leaders Djalma de Souza Bom, Luiz Incio da Silva, Emilson Simes de Moura, Rubens Teodoro de Arruda, Jos Maria de Almeida, Osmar Santos de Mendoga, Juraci Batista Magalhaes, Manoel Anisio Gomes, Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes, Nelson Campanholo and Wagner Lima Alves.
.Concerning the trade union leaders mentioned above, the Committee at its May  Session, after observing that the principal reason for the convictions appeared to have been the incitement to take part in the strike declared illegal on  April  and considering that such incitement should not be considered as constituting an offence, drew the Government's attention to the fact that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes and expressed the hope that the final judgement handed down in the case concerning the convicted trade union leaders would take full account of the generally recognised principles of freedom of association. The Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the proceedings.
.As regards the other pending questions, the Committee requested the Government to indicate whether the convicted trade union leaders could again take up their functions normally and regretted that the Government had still not sent the observations requested on certain allegations, requesting it accordingly to send information on the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April , which were alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest for several hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which were said to have taken place two days after the strike.
.In its communication of  August , the ICFTU states that the appeal lodged by the metalworkers' trade union leaders tried by the military court would be examined on  September .
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that on  September  the Higher Military Court accepted the plea for annulment submitted by the lawyers of the trade union leaders who had been convicted and declared the trial null and void. As a result, the proceedings must be referred back for a fresh trial to the court which originally examined the case.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied by the ICFTU and the Government. Considering that the case against the convicted trade union leaders is to be reviewed and that the Government has not yet supplied certain observations and information requested of it, the Committee maintains the principal conclusions it reached in its previous report concerning the trade union leaders tried and the information requested.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes.The Committee expresses the hope that the final judgement handed down in the case concerning Luiz Incio de Silva and the other convicted trade union leaders will take full account of the generally recognised principles of freedom of association and requests the Government to transmit the text of the judgement and to keep it informed of any subsequent developments in this respect.The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the trade union leaders tried are able to take up their functions normally at present and to send information on the allegations to which it has not yet replied (arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April  resulting in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest for several hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which took place two days after the strike).
.The Committee examined this case at its February  Session and presented an interim report to the Governing Body, Subsequently, the Committee has received a communication from the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  March . The Government replied in a communication dated  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations referred to the strike by the workers of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo from  April to  May , the primary purpose of which was to obtain wage increases and continuity of employment for a year, and which was declared illegal by the judicial authorities on  April , and to the events which occurred during and after the strike: intervention by the authorities in trade unions, removal from office of trade union leaders and their replacement by civil servants, arrests of trade union leaders and the prosecution under the National Security Act of union leaders.
.The Committee, having noted that the declaration of the strike's illegality was a consequence of a compulsory arbitration award that settled the disputed wage questions and imposed the termination of the work stoppage, drew the Government's attention to the principles of freedom of association in this respect.
.Referring to the intervention by the authorities in trade unions and the replacement of leaders, the Committee recalled the principle of the right of organisations to elect their representatives and to organise their administration and activities in full freedom and asked the Government to inform it of the measures taken to cease the control of the authorities over the unions.
.The Committee also noted the Government's statement that the orders for the imprisonment of the arrested leaders have been countermanded, but that the latter were still under trial and that the offences for which they might be held responsible as a result of their contempt for the decision of the Regional Labour Court were still under examination. In this connection the Committee stressed that the development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action particularly when these are penal sanctions. The Committee thus requested the Government to send information on the results of the judicial proceedings against the arrested trade union leaders.
.Lastly, the Committee requested the Government to send information on the allegations concerning which it had not replied (the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, the physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April , which are alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of assemblies announced by the police on  April, the arrest for a few hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and the many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which are said to have taken place two days after the strike).
.In its communication of  March , the WFTU alleges that the Military Court of Sao Paulo has sentenced  trade union leaders from the metallurgical sector to many",-1,1980,Brazil
106,"years' imprisonment; they had been accused of threatening national security in violation of Act No.  of  December  by participating in and leading the metalworkers' strike in support of their socio-economic claims. Nevertheless, according to the WFTU, the actions of the workers' struggle could not have endangered national security: the strike was peaceful, negotiations were going on with the employers and the civil authorities and there were not even any strike pickets.
.The WFTU states that the convicted trade unionists have lost all civil rights for ten years and thus will be unable to carry out their activities and that they are released pending a new appeal before the Supreme Military Court.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that Luis Incio da Silva and the other leaders were brought to trial and sentenced for inciting collective disobedience of the laws, not only for having called for participation in the strike which had been declared illegal, but also for having committed injurious acts against persons and property and for having physically injured the workers who were not involved in the strike.
.According to the Government, the accused went beyond their alleged claimed objectives, openly challenging the Government, the national institutions and the established authorities, endangering social peace and national prosperity, stirring up insecurity in the community and causing serious prejudice to the country's economy, thus infringing the provisions of Act No. / which defines offences against national security.
.The Government also states that except for Jos Gicote and Jos Timteo da Silva, who were acquitted, the accused were sentenced under section , paragraph II, of Act No. / (""inciting collective disobedience of the laws"") to the following prison terms: Djalma de Souza Bon, Luis Incio da Silva, Emilson Simes de Maura and Rubens Teodoro de Arruda -  years  months; Jos Maria de Almeida, Osmar Santos de Mendona, Juraci Batista Magalhes, Manoel Anisio Gomes and Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes -  years  months; Nelson Companholo and Wagner Lima Alves -  years. The Government adds that those convicted are at liberty pending the decision of the judicial appeal and that, if the sentences are confirmed, they would still be able to appeal to the Federal Supreme Court.
.Lastly, as concerns the allegation relating to intervention by the authorities in the trade unions, the Government states that, by a decision of  February , the Minister of State for Labour suspended the controls still existing over trade unions and named joint managements, made up of members of the various occupational categories so as to call elections within the next  days.
.The Committee notes that under section , paragraph II, of Act No. / (""inciting collective disobedience of the laws"") Djalma de Souza Bon, Luis Incio da Silva, Emilson Simes de Maura and Rubens Teodoro de Arruda were sentenced by a military court to  years and  months' imprisonment; Jos Maria de Almeida, Oscar Santos de Mendona, Juraci Batista Magalhes, Manoel Anisio Gomes and Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes to  years and  months' imprisonment; and Nelson Companholo and Wagner Lima Alves to  years"" imprisonment. The Committee notes that Jos Gicote and Jos Timteo da Silva were acquitted and that the convicted trade union leaders are free pending the decision at second instance of the Supreme Military Court.
.The Committee, while noting the Government's statements concerning injurious acts against persons and property and the use of physical violence against workers by the convicted trade union leaders, observes that it has not specified the concrete charges which are said to be brought against each one of them and that the principal reason for the convictions appears to have been the incitement to take part in the strike declared illegal on  April .
.On the other hand, the Committee notes that the strike basically supported wage claims and that its illegality was proclaimed as a consequence of the non-submission to the compulsory arbitration award which had decided the disputed wage questions thus imposing a duty on the workers to resume work. In these circumstances, the Committee, which has on several occasions, considered that recourse to compulsory arbitration as a restriction on the right to strike is only admissible in the public service or in essential services in the strict sense (which is not the case of the metallurgical sector) considers that proceeding with the strike in question - although it had been declared illegal - does not appear to go beyond the normal scope of trade union activities and should not therefore be considered as constituting an offence, even more so in view of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Brazil, which establishes that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination shall apply against any act calculated to prejudice a worker by reason of his participation in union activities.
.Consequently, while again drawing the Government's attention to the principle that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes, the Committee hopes that the final judgement which will be handed down in the case concerning the convicted trade union leaders will take full account of the generally recognised principles on freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial decision on appeal.
.The Committee notes with interest that by a decision of  February , the Minister of State for Labour suspended the controls still existing over trade unions and that elections will take place within  days. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the leaders who had been removed from office can take up their functions again at the present time normally.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has still not sent the observations requested on certain allegations and accordingly requests the Government to send information on the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April  which are alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of assemblies announced by the police on  April , the arrest for a few hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which are said to have taken place two days after the strike.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the National Labour Front (FNT) ( April ), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) ( April ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) ( April ), and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) ( April). The WCL sent additional information on  April and  May , the ICFTU and IMF on  April and  May  and  February , and the FNT on  January . The Government replied by a communication of  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations refer to the strike by the workers of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo from  April to  May , the primary purpose of which was to obtain wage increases and continuity of employment for a year, and which was declared illegal by the judicial authorities on  April .
.The complainants allege that many people were injured on  April as a result of violent intervention by the military police against groups of workers who were gathered together in front of the headquarters of their trade unions. According to the WFTU, several dozens of workers were injured.
.The complainants add that the authorities removed trade union leaders from office and replaced them by officials appointed by the political authorities; one of the leaders affected was Luis Incio da Silva. The FNT, for its part, alleges that the authorities placed the metalworkers' unions of Sao Bernardo and Santo Andr under control, and the WCL, in its communication of  April , alleges that trade unions were arbitrarily dissolved.
.In its communication of  April , the WCL mentions the arrest of  persons;  of these are said to have been freed a few days later, but at the date of the communication the following trade union leaders were still under arrest: Luis Incio da Silva, Devanir Ribeiro, Orlando Francelino da Motta, Jos Cicotti, Dijalma de Souza, Ernesto Cencini, Isaias Urbano de Cunha, Edevaldo Santiago de Araujo, Jos Maria de Almeida, Expdito Soares, Severino Alves da Silva and Joao Batista dos Santos. The communication from the ICFTU and IMF of  April  states that on  April about  trade unionists were still in prison, including Arnaldo Gonalves. The communication from the WCL dated  April  further alleges that a delegation of agricultural workers who wished to demonstrate their support for the strikers was also arrested, but only for a few hours.",-1,1980,Brazil
107,"In their last communication the ICFTU and IMF state that the political police arrested one of the organisers of the strike, Osmar Mendonca, when he was in a church proposing a return to work, and that  trade unionists - including Luis Incio da Silva - were released on  May, although the authorities had arrested six trade union leaders on suspicion of having continued the action which had been begun by those who were under arrest. In their communication of  April , the ICFTU and IMF state that, on  April, the police announced the prohibition of assemblies of strikers in districts where general assemblies were to have been held.
.The complainants also allege that , metalworkers were dismissed on  May  - two days after the strike had ended - and stress the need to adopt new labour legislation in conformity with ILO Conventions.
.In its communication of  January , the FNT states that the trade union leaders were to be tried in February under the National Security Act. In its communication of  February , the ICFTU and IMF state that these persons are Luis Inacio da Silva, Rubens Teodoro Arruda, Djalma de Souza Bom, Osmar Santos Mendoa, Enilson Simoes de Moura, Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes, Jurandir Batista Magalhes, Nelson Campanholo and Manoel Anisio Gomes (the Trade Union of Metalworkers of So Bernardo do Campo); and Jos Cicote, Jos Timteo da Silva and Jos Maria de Almeida (the Trade Union of Metalworkers of Santo Andre).
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that, now that ""the charismatic hold"" of Luis Incio da Silva over his followers has been broken and that he and the other trade union leaders have been released, social peace has returned to the category of professional metalworkers of Sao Paulo.
.According to the Government, the strike was called on  March  after the labour authorities had exhausted all possibilities of negotiation with a view to bringing about conciliation between the metalworkers' unions and the employers of Group  of the FIESP.
.Among the wage claims made, according to the Government, was the demand for a  per cent increase over and above the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), which, if it had been granted, would have involved an adjustment of almost  per cent per annum at a time when inflation was running at only  per cent. In the course of the negotiations which preceded the strike, the employers repeatedly raised their offers of percentage increases above the NCPI, but their offers were rejected.
.In its decision of  April , states the Government, the Regional Labour Court (RLC) of the second region granted an increase of  or  per cent (depending on the situation of the workers) in return for higher productivity. This increase was rejected and the strike continued, thus marking contempt for a decision of the labour court; the strike was therefore declared illegal by the RLC on  April under section  of Act No.  of  June , which stipulates that ""a strike shall be terminated by decision of a labour court"", and under section  of the same Act, which prohibits strikes ""for the purpose of altering the fixed conditions of a decision handed down by a labour court"". The Government also remarks that no appeal was made against the court decision of  April.
.The Government states that the object of the assumption of control of the trade unions ordered by the Minister was to halt a strike which had deviated from its true purpose and which relegated the legitimate demands of workers to second place; the Government adds that this action was carried out under section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, which empowers the labour authority, in the event of a dispute or of circumstances of such a nature as to disrupt the operation of a trade union body, to intervene for the purpose of taking control of such body and to propose or take the necessary steps to ensure that it again functions normally. In application of the law, continues the Government, the trade union leaders were removed from office, a sanction provided for by section b of the Consolidation of Labour Laws in the event of a suspension of services or contempt for the decisions of the labour courts at the instigation or orders of the leaders.
.As regards the arrests and interrogations, the Government states that the leaders mentioned by the WCL were imprisoned for contempt of the RLC's injunction to terminate the strike and for contravention of the National Security Act, under section  of which incitement to collective contravention of the Act and incitement to hostility to the armed forces, or the encouragement of hostility between the armed forces and classes of society or civil institutions, are punishable as offences. The Government adds that the orders for the arrest of the above-mentioned trade union leaders were countermanded on  and  May , that any offences for which they may be responsible are still under examination by the judicial authorities, and that the trials of the leaders are continuing.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the strike was declared illegal by a decision of the judicial authority in application of sections  and  of Act No.  because it had been continued by the trade union leaders and workers in contempt of the earlier court order making a binding settlement as regards wage increases. The Committee also notes that the strike ended on  May  and that there is now social peace in the metallurgical sector.
.After examining the statements of the Government, the Committee wishes to point out, as it has already done quite recently in the case of similar complaints against the Government of Brazil, that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests on the basis of this principle the Committee has considered that the conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must be reasonable and, in any event, not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations.
.In the present case the Committee observes that the dispute between the workers and the employers of the metallurgical sector of Sao Paulo was referred to the courts, which, on the day following the declaration of the strike, gave a binding decision regulating the disputed wage issues and thus making it unlawful to continue the strike. In this respect, although in some cases the Committee has recognised that the obligation to notify the administrative authorities in advance and to have recourse to conciliation and voluntary arbitration procedures in collective labour disputes may not be regarded as a violation of the principles of freedom of association, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the imposition of compulsory arbitration, whether by judicial or by administrative authority, may prevent the workers from resorting to strike action - particularly if the penalties for those who do so are serious - thus depriving them of an essential method of promoting and defending the interests of their members.
.As regards the placing under control of the trade unions by the authorities, the removal from office of trade union leaders and their replacement by government officials, the Committee notes that section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws authorises such intervention in the event of disputes or circumstances of such a nature as to disrupt the normal operation of a trade union body, and that section b of the Consolidation of Labour Laws permits the removal from office of leaders in the event of suspension of services or contempt for decisions of the labour courts.
.In connection with this aspect of the case the Committee must, however, recall that it has on a number of occasions examined cases concerning the placing under control of the unions by the Brazilian authorities. In these cases the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives and organise their administration and activities in full freedom, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee has also pointed out that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting this right. Furthermore, the Government does not state whether it has put an end to the control of the trade unions and whether the trade union leaders have been able to resume office. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leaders mentioned by the complainants and the court cases in which they are going to appear, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the orders for the",-1,1980,Brazil
108,"imprisonment of the arrested leaders have been countermanded, but that the latter are still under trial and that the offences for which they might be held responsible as a result of their contempt for the decision of the Regional Labour Court are still under examination. In this connection the Committee must stress that the development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action, particularly when these are penal sanctions. The Committee also requests the Government to send information on the results of the judicial proceedings against the arrested trade union leaders.
.In the light of the foregoing considerations the Committee feels that it would be useful, in the interests of the development of harmonious industrial relations in the country, for the Government to amend its legislation in the light of the principles set forth in the foregoing paragraphs.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not referred in its communication to the allegations relating to the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, or to the physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April, which are alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, or to the prohibition on the holding of assemblies announced by the police on  April, or to the arrest for a few hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, or to the many dismissals which are said to have taken place two days after the strike. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send additional information on each of these points.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that, although the lawfulness of a strike may be made subject to previous recourse to conciliation or voluntary arbitration procedures, the imposition, in the present Brazilian judicial system, of compulsory arbitration resulting in a compulsory award can deprive the workers of the possibility of legally exercising their right to strike action.The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of the court proceedings pending against the trade union leaders mentioned by the complainants.It also requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken to cease the control of the authorities over the unions.The Committee requests the Government to send additional information on the allegations to which it has not replied, as set forth in the previous paragraph.",-1,1980,Brazil
109,".The Committee examined this case earlier, at its November  Session when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) sent a telegram to the ILO on  November . For its part, the Government sent observations in communications dated  January,  February and  March .
.The complaints presented in the present case mainly concern a strike called by the metalworkers' unions of the Sao Paulo region in March . New complaints have been received recently regarding the events which took place in April and May  in the same sector (Case No. ). These complaints have been sent to the Government for its observations and the Committee intends to examine this case at its next session.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The dispute which took place in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in March  originated in a disagreement which arose during collective bargaining. It would appear that an earlier wage adjustment had been deducted from wage increases granted during negotiations in . After the strike began the dispute was taken to the labour court, which gave a decision granting a wage increase limited to that authorised by the Government and declared the strike illegal under the legislative provisions regulating the right to strike. The strike nevertheless continued, and the unions which had organised it were placed under control and their leaders suspended. Although they had been removed from office, the leaders accepted a -day truce and an agreement in the hope of finding an amicable solution to the dispute, on the understanding that no striker would be dismissed. Despite the agreement, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) mentioned the dismissal of  workers.
.WCL also stated that Brazilian legislation contained provisions which denied freedom of expression and association and the effective recognition of the right to bargain. According to WCL, the trade unions were subject to state control as regards the drafting of their rules, the election or removal from office of their officials, their financial management, trade union meetings and their programmes of action (prohibition of action contrary to the financial policy of the Government). In addition, WCL considered that there was ample proof of repeated violations of Convention No. , which Brazil had ratified. Thus, section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws permitted the suspension of any provision of a collective agreement which was in direct or indirect contradiction of the Government's wages policy. Furthermore, section  of Act No.  authorised the Government to appeal against judgements of the labour court, with suspensory effect, in the event that the percentage of wage increase agreed upon exceeded that laid down by the executive.
.At its November  Session, on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, referring to the Brazilian legislation respecting the right to strike, stressed that the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must not be such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations. The Governing Body also requested the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the dismissals of workers following the strike, and on the general allegations concerning the legislative provisions relating to the control exercised by the authorities on the operation of trade unions and restrictions on the right to bargain collectively.
.The Committee observes that the questions raised in the present case deal with three sets of allegations: dismissals of workers following the strike in the Sao Paulo metallurgical sector; the death of a trade unionist during clashes with the police; and the restrictive provisions of Brazilian legislation as regards freedom of association and collective bargaining.(a) Dismissals of workers
.In connection with the dismissals, the Committee must note that there is a substantial divergence between the version of the events given by the Government and that given by the complainants. It appears, however, from the information available that at least some of these dismissals followed prosecutions in connection with the strike, which had been declared illegal by the labour court. The Committee notes that the Government has stated in this connection that strike pickets used violence to prevent workers from entering the workplace and that a number of undertakings took advantage of the fact that the strike had been declared illegal to dismiss an unspecified number of workers. The Committee has also noted the details given by the Government following inquiries made at its request, from which it would appear that only four workers had been dismissed because of the strike. The Committee nevertheless recalls that the complainants allege that there had been a wave of collective dismissals affecting about  workers.
.The Committee is not in possession of sufficient information to enable it to formulate a precise opinion on the extent of the wave of dismissals. It nevertheless recalls that in earlier cases, where it has examined allegations of dismissals following strikes, it has considered that such measures involve serious risk of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. It has held the view that, on such occasions, the development of labour relations could be impaired as the result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action. Consequently, and whatever the extent of the dismissals, it would seem desirable for the Government, in a spirit of reconciliation, to intervene with the managements of the undertakings concerned to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, in view of the fact that the strike must remain one of the essential means available to workers to enable them to press their claims.(b) Death of a trade unionist
.As concerns this aspect of the case, the Committee recalls that in earlier cases it has considered that the intervention by security forces in strike activities should be limited to the maintenance of public order. It notes that an inquiry was made into the circumstances of this death and that the case came before the courts. The Committee can only deplore the climate of unrest which led to the violent death of a striking worker, and expresses the hope that the legal proceedings which have been instituted will enable responsibilities to be determined. The Committee would like to be kept informed of the results of the judicial proceedings underway.(c) Allegations relating to trade union legislation
.As regards state control of trade union operation, the Committee observes that Legislative Decree No.  of  respecting the Consolidation of Labour Laws, as amended, is highly interventionist in character. There is a requirement that the rules of trade unions must contain a statement that the union will act as a body for co-operation with the public authorities for the subordination of economic and occupational interests to the interests of the State (section ); the election of trade union officials is subject to the approval of the Minister of Labour (section ); the Minister issues instructions governing the electoral procedure (section , subsection ). the Minister may also, in the event of a dispute or any occurrence which disturbs the operation of an industrial association, intervene through a representative with powers to manage the association temporarily (section , and section , note , as amended by Act No.  of  June ); the property and income of an industrial association may not be transferred except with the authorisation of the Minister (section , sole subsection); finally, the programme of action implies the subordination of the economic and occupational interests of the trade unions to the interests of the State (section , subsection (c)).
.The Committee notes that the Government refers in its observations to the need to revise certain provisions, but that the only amendments that may be expected relate to matters of detail in this connection the Committee remarks that the draft Bill for the revision of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, published in the Official Gazette of  May , no longer appears to assign trade unions the specific role of a body for co-operation with the public authorities in the sense of subordinating their interests to the interests of the State. The Committee recalls, as it has done in other circumstances, that legislation which imposes a strict control by the State over the drawing up of rules, the election and removal from office of trade union officials, financial management and programmes of action is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, according to which workers' organisations should have the right to organise their administration and activities without any interference on the part of the public authorities which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee accordingly hopes that it will be possible to take other measures, before the draft Bill is finally adopted, to bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(d) Allegations relating to",-1,1979,Brazil
110,"restrictions on collective bargaining
.As regards this aspect of the case the Committee remarks that these restrictions were introduced into the legislation in  and . In this connection the Committee refers to the comments which the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made for a number of years regarding the application of Convention No.  by Brazil. The comments refer in particular to sections  (as amended by Legislative Decree No.  of  February ) and  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws and section  of Act No.  of  June . These provisions, as mentioned by the complainants, establish the nullity of any clause of a collective agreement which is in direct or indirect contradiction with the Government's wages policy, and authorise the Government to appeal against judgements of the labour courts, with suspensory effect, in the event that the percentage of wage increase agreed upon exceeds that laid down by the executive. The Committee of Experts considered that these provisions might seriously affect the ""full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation"" mentioned in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Brazil. Furthermore, the Committee wishes to stress, in connection with Act No.  of  October  respecting the automatic adjustment of wages, as it has already done on many occasions with respect to Brazil and other countries, that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that it is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.More specifically, as regards section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, the Committee notes that a Government representative stated at the June  Session of the International Labour Conference that this provision had been removed from the draft Bill mentioned above.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissals which followed the strike in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in March :(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above;(ii) to suggest that the Government might intervene with the managements of the undertakings concerned to obtain the reinstatement of workers dismissed only for having taken part in a strike which would conform with the principle that the right to strike is one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests;(b) as regards the death of Mr. Santos Dias da Silva:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above and to note that an inquiry was made into the circumstances of his death and that the case is now before the courts;(ii) to deplore the climate of unrest which led to the violent death of a striking worker and to express the hope that the proceedings instituted before the courts will enable responsibilities to be determined;(iii) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings underway;(c) as regards the national trade union legislation and collective bargaining.(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraphs  and  as regards the provisions in the legislation imposing state control over the operation of trade unions and collective bargaining which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association;(ii) to express the hope that it will be possible to take measures for the final adoption of the draft Bill for the revision of the Consolidation of Labour Laws in order to bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association;(d) more generally, to note that new complaints have been received regarding events which took place in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in April and May  which will be examined by the Committee at its next session.
.In communications dated respectively ,  and  March and  April , the National Labour Front (FNT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), presented complaints of violation of trade union rights in Brazil. WCL sent additional information in support of its complaint on  May . In the same communication it transmitted documentation sent to it by the National Labour Front and stated that it supported the complaint of that Organisation. The Government, for its part, sent its observations in a letter of  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints of FNT, WFTU and CLAT, which were sent to the ILO by telegram, refer to the government decision to place under control the trade unions of the metallurgical and engineering industries of the State of Sao Paulo following a strike to obtain higher wages. CLAT also refers to dismissals affecting  workers.
.In its letter of  March  WCL states that during collective bargaining in the metallurgical sector in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr and Sao Caetano (all in the Sao Paulo industrial area), the employers' representatives refused to grant a  per cent wage increase which, according to WCL, was merely an adjustment to make good the loss of purchasing power.
.Following this refusal votes were taken in workers' assemblies - certain of which were attended by over , persons - and it was decided to call a strike of unlimited duration beginning  March . The Government declared this move to be unlawful under legislation which, according to WCL, virtually denies the right to strike. Furthermore, continues the complainant organisation, although the strike spread to other major industrial centres of the State of Sao Paulo, such as Jundiai and Sao Jos dos Campos, the Government decided to place all the metalworkers' unions of Sao Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr and Sao Caetano under control.
.WCL attaches to its letter of  May  a communication dated  April  addressed to the ILO by the National Labour Front and supported by the dismissed officials of the metalworkers unions of Sao Bernardo do Campo, Diadema and Santo Andr, the Metalworkers' Union of Sao Paulo, the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical Industries of Osasco and  other Brazilian workers' organisations in various sectors of activity.
.The documents annexed to the communication of ENT indicate that there are certain weaknesses in the Brazilian legislation. Firstly, it does not provide for effective sanctions against undertakings which do not respect the law. Secondly, it establishes strict supervision of unions by the Ministry of Labour by allowing the Minister or his regional delegates to intervene in any organisation on any pretext whatsoever. Thirdly, the right to strike of workers is non-existent. Finally, as from , severance pay for older workers and stability of employment have been seriously affected by the creation of the ""length of service guarantee fund"", in that the guarantee of employment for trade union leaders is only temporary and that severance pay has been reduced without just cause.
.The ENT documentation also points out that, despite the provisions of section  of the consolidation of Labour Laws, under which employers do not have the right to refuse to bargain, they systematically attempt to evade their obligations when serious matters are to be discussed. Moreover, when problems arising out of collective agreements are brought before the labour courts, these do not examine the questions raised or confine themselves to applying the wage increases decided by the executive.
.As regards the labour dispute to which the complaints refer, it is stated that the trade unions in which the Ministry of Labour has intervened are geographically based in the seven centres of Greater Sao Paulo, where the automobile industry is concentrated.
.The document also states that a survey had been carried out by the Inter-Union Department of Socio-economic Studies and Statistics, a body set up by the unions. This survey had established that, in order to ensure the maintenance of the workers' purchasing powers, wages should be increased by . per cent. In order to obtain this compensation certain trade unions made unsuccessful appeals to the courts and others, including those mentioned in the complaints, exerted pressure from the rank and file, with or without strikes, and thus obtained partial payment of the . per cent increase by direct agreement with the employers or their organisations. Thus, in May and July , the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical, Engineering and Electrical Equipment Industries of Sao Bernardo do Campo and Diadema and the Union of Machinery Industries of the State of Sao Paulo concluded agreements for an  per cent increase which was to be permanently incorporated into the wage and which might not be deducted from future adjustments.
.In February  further negotiations took place.",-1,1979,Brazil
111,"An agreement was signed by  unions represented by the Metalworkers' Federation of the State of Sao Paulo, who received wage increases of from - per cent, although the increases established by the Government were  per cent. Nevertheless, the  per cent increase agreed on in  had been deducted from the adjustment, and three metalworkers' unions of Santo Andr, Sao Bernardo and Sao Caetano therefore decided to continue the strike which they had begun on  March . After persistent failure to reach an agreement, the dispute was brought before the labour court on  March , and it gave a judgement in less than  hours. By a decision which was not taken unanimously, the court granted a  per cent increase, the amount authorised by the executive, but less than that granted under the collective agreement signed by the  unions of the Metalworkers' Federation of Sao Paulo. Furthermore, the court declared the strike to be illegal.
.As a result of this failure, the workers decided to continue the strike. The Minister of Labour then went to Sao Paulo, where he tried in vain for several days to reconcile the parties. This led to the placing under control of the trade unions, the suspension of their leaders and the appointment of officials of the Ministry of Labour to head the trade union organisations on  March .
.However, the workers continued to meet in the town hall of Sao Bernardo and in churches. When contacted by the parties, the National Synod of Brazilian Bishops enabled the resumption of the interrupted dialogue between the Government, the employers and the workers. The dismissed officials of the unions of Santo Andr, Sao Bernardo and Sao Caetano then accepted a -day truce and the extension of the agreement signed by the  unions of the Metalworkers' Federation of Sao Paulo, in the hope of finding an amicable solution to the dispute and the problem of payment for the time the workers were on strike. It was also understood that no striker would be dismissed. Accordingly, the strike ended on  March .
.The Minister of Labour then said that the control of the trade unions might be ended in the near future and that the leaders who had been removed from office would be authorised to resume leadership of the trade unions. Subsequently, however, the Minister is said to have contradicted this statement. Finally, the document mentions the dismissal of about , workers despite the agreement reached on this point.
.The judgement of the Regional Labour Court of the Second Region which declared the strike to be illegal, and which is included in the documents supplied by ENT, refers to Act No.  of  June , to regulate the right to strike. Under section  of this Act ""the exercise of the right to strike shall be based on a decision adopted by secret ballot by a majority vote of the general meeting of the industrial association representing the occupational category concerned, two-thirds of the members of the industrial association being present (in the case of a first convocation of the meeting) or one-third of the members (where the general meeting is convoked for the second time)"". Furthermore, section  of the Act provides that every general meeting shall be convoked by the managing Committee of the industrial association concerned by notices published ten days beforehand in the local newspapers of the place where the industrial association is situated. The court did not find any evidence in the file that these formalities were respected and accordingly considered that the strike was illegal.
.In its covering letter to the communication from ENT, WCL declares that Brazilian legislation contains provisions which deny freedom of expression and association and the effective recognition of the right to bargain. According to WCL the labour legislation defines the trade union as a body for co-operation with the public authorities, which is subject to state control as regards the drafting of its rules, the election or removal from office of officials, its financial management, trade union meetings and its programme of action (prohibition of action contrary to the financial policy of the Government).
.In addition, WCL considers that there is ample proof of repeated violations of Convention No. , which Brazil has ratified. Thus, section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws permits the suspension of any provision of a collective agreement which is in direct or indirect contradiction with the government's wages policy. Furthermore, section  of Act No.  authorises the Government to appeal against judgements of the labour court, with suspensory effect, in the event that the percentage of wage increase agreed upon exceeds that laid down by the executive.
.WCL also refers to Act No.  of  September , to establish a length of service guarantee fund which, it says, gives the employer unlimited power to dismiss a worker even if there are no grounds to justify the dismissal. Thus, concludes WCL, the whole system of workers' protection is rendered inoperative.
.In its reply the Government first states that the placing under control of the unions mentioned in the complaints is based on the legislation which has been in force since , the purpose of which is to guarantee the authority of a judicial body.
.The Government states that the Regional Labour Court declared the strike illegal solely because the unions concerned did not respect the formalities prescribed by Act No.  to regulate the right to strike, as provided in section  of the Federal Constitution in fact, continues the Government, the unions called the strike without respecting the period of advance notice or convening general meetings as provided for under the legislation. In addition, Act No.  prescribes that the vote-counting by the returning officers shall be presided over by a member of the legal service for labour matters (public prosecutor's department), and that the decision taken shall be notified to the local body of the Ministry of Labour. According to the Government none of these procedures was followed in the present case, and the legal counsel for the trade unions were unable to produce the records of the meetings as required by law. The court therefore declared the strike to be illegal.
.The Government states that the trade unions should then have complied with the judgement and should have decided to return to work, although it was open to them to lodge an appeal with the Higher Labour Court. However, they announced that they opposed the judgement and incited the workers to continue the strike. This attitude led the competent authority, namely the Minister of Labour, to decide to place the organisations under control in accordance with section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws. This decision was preceded by appeals to the organisations concerned from the labour authorities requesting them to respect the legal order.
.As the officials of the organisations failed to appreciate the reasons why they should respect the court's decision and abandoned purely trade union objectives in flagrant violation of the law, the only course of action was that laid down by section , subsection , and section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, namely the removal of trade union leaders from office. The Government also remarks that the decisions of the judiciary must be respected by the community and that trade unions must respect the law of the land, as stipulated by Article  of Convention No. .
.The Government next refers to the principle expressed by the Committee in earlier cases, namely, that prohibition of strikes in the event of a legal dispute does not constitute violation of freedom of association. It also states that the report submitted to the international Labour Conference on the occasion of the adoption of Convention No.  stated that Article  of the Convention should not be interpreted in such a way as to jeopardise the independence and authority of the courts. In the Government's opinion this is precisely what the trade unions have done in the present case.
.In a note attached to its communication the Government mentions that, by Order of  May , the Ministry of Labour has suspended the control of the three trade unions, thus putting an end to the suspension of their leaders. The Government says that this is because they have changed their earlier stand and have taken concrete steps for the application of the decision o-f the Regional Labour Court. Respect for the judicial decision thus having been re-established and the independence and authority of the court reaffirmed, the executive was able to put an end to the control of the trade unions and reinstate their leaders. The Government remarks that these leaders brought no judicial action when they were removed from office, although Brazilian law provides for a special right of appeal against acts of the authorities which are considered to violate the rights of the individual.
.The Committee notes that the complaints made in the present case contain five types of allegations: the decision as to the illegality of",-1,1979,Brazil
112,"the strike called by the metalworkers' unions in the Sao Paulo region in March  and the alleged practical impossibility of exercising the right to strike; the placing under control of these organisations and the suspension of their leaders; dismissals of workers following the strike; state control of the operation of trade unions; and, finally, restrictions on the right to bargain collectively.
.As regards the decision that the strike in the metallurgical sector of Sao Paulo was illegal, it appears from the information in the Committee's possession that the dispute arose out of a difference of opinion during collective wage negotiations. A wage adjustment granted in  had, it appears, been deducted from the increases granted during negotiations in . The dispute had been brought before the labour court after the strike had broken out. The latter handed down a judgement which, on the one hand, granted a wage increase limited to that authorised by the Government and, on the other hand, declared the strike illegal on the basis of the legislative provisions regulating the right to strike. It would seem, from the information supplied by the Government, that the trade unions did not respect these provisions.
.Despite the fact that the strike had been declared illegal, it continued for almost two weeks, following which a truce was accepted for the purpose of reaching an amicable solution and work was resumed.
.In the many cases relating to the right to strike which have come before it, the Committee has considered that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. On the basis of this principle the Committee has considered that the conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must be reasonable and in any event not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations.
.The conditions fixed for the calling of a strike by Brazilian law, and in particular by Act No.  of , are of various kinds. The decision must be adopted by secret ballot by a majority vote of the general meeting of the industrial association, two-thirds of the members of the industrial association being present (in the case of a first convocation of the meeting) or one third of the members (where the general meeting is convoked for a second time). The convocation of the meeting must be published ten days beforehand in the local newspapers. The returning officers must be presided over by a magistrate, and a copy of the decision transmitted to the authorities and the employer, the latter being granted a period of five days in which to accept the claims, after which a strike may be declared subject to a further period of notice of five days.
.In the past, the Committee has considered acceptable the obligation to observe a certain quorum, to take decisions to strike by secret ballot, and to give prior notice to the employer before calling the strike. Nevertheless, the Committee feels obliged to remark that the observation of a quorum of two-thirds of the members, as fixed by Brazilian legislation for the first meeting, may be difficult to reach, in particular where trade unions have large numbers of members or cover a large area. In these circumstances the obligation to convene a further meeting at ten days' notice may result in considerable delay before a decision to strike may be considered to be valid. In this respect the Committee has taken note of a draft Bill to revise the Consolidation of Labour Laws, which was published in the Official Gazette of Brazil on  may . It notes that this draft Bill, which is now to be submitted to Parliament, proposes to reduce the quorum required before a strike can be called.
.Apart from the formal conditions for calling a strike, Brazilian legislation contains provisions regarding the submission of collective labour disputes to conciliation and arbitration. In this connection the complainants have stated that the exercise of the right to strike is denied in practice. The Committee examined these provisions of Act No.  in an earlier case relating to Brazil, when it noted that, under section  of the Act, the authorities are under the obligation to take such action as may induce a settlement between workers and employers during the five-day period following the general meeting. Furthermore, according to section , if conciliation fails, the matter is referred to the President of the Regional Labour Court. The decision of the Court is executory. As the Committee has already pointed out, the provisions mentioned above may jeopardise the workers' possibility to strike and deprive them of an essential method of promoting and defending the interests of their members. While noting that the right to strike is recognised by the Brazilian Constitution, the Committee can only confirm its conclusions in the present case and stress that such restrictions are not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and that, if workers' organisations are under the obligation to respect the law of the land, as the Government indicates, the law of the land must not be such as to impair, nor must it be so applied as to impair, the generally accepted rights of trade unions.
.As regards the placing under control of the three unions mentioned in the complaint and the suspension of their leaders, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that these measures were taken because the said leaders had failed to respect the court decision pronouncing the strike illegal. The Committee also notes with interest that, once the decision to resume work had been taken, the Government put an end to the control of the unions by the authorities and to the suspension of the union leaders.
.In connection with this aspect of the case the Committee must, however, recall that it has on a number of occasions examined cases concerning the placing under control of the unions by the Brazilian authorities. In these cases the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee also pointed out that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting this right.
.In reaffirming these principles the Committee wishes to state that control of the internal activities of a trade union may be compatible with freedom of association when the organisation contravenes legislative provisions, which, however, should not be such as to violate the principles of freedom of association. Nevertheless, it is highly important, in order to guarantee the impartiality and objectiveness of the procedure, that this control should be exercised by the competent judicial authority. In this connection the Committee notes that the draft Bill to revise the Consolidation of Labour Laws mentioned above proposes to abolish the powers at present enjoyed by the Ministry of Labour to suspend trade union leaders or remove them from office, close down organisations temporarily or cancel their certificates of registration.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations concerning the alleged dismissal of around , workers following the strike, nor concerning the general allegations that the legislation empowers the authorities to exert control over the operation of trade unions (drawing up of rules, election of officers, financial management, trade union meetings) and that the right to collective bargaining is subject to restrictions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the right to strike, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above and to stress that the conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must not be such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations;(b) as regards the placing under control of trade union organisations in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo and the suspension of their leaders:(i) to note with interest that these measures have been lifted;(ii) nevertheless, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraphs  and  above and to recall that the power of the administrative authorities to order the placing of trade unions under control and the suspension of trade union leaders do not offer the necessary guarantees to ensure the right of trade unions to organise their administration and their activities;(c) as regards the other aspects of the case, to request the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the dismissals of workers following the strike, and on the general allegations concerning the legislative provisions relating to the control exercised by the authorities on the operation of trade unions and restrictions on the right to bargain collectively;(d) to take",-1,1979,Brazil
113,note of the present interim report.,-1,1979,Brazil
114,".The Committee has already examined this case at its November  session, when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report in November  (th Session).
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still outstanding concern the situation of Mr. Jos Duarte. The WFTU had alleged that Mr. Duarte, a trade union leader on the railways in the north-east of the country, had been detained without trial since ; it claimed that he had suffered ill-treatment whilst in Bahia state prison, and that he was now in the prison of the Paulo Sarasarte Penal Institute in the State of Cear. Aged about  years, he was said to have had a heart attack as a result of this ill-treatment.
.According to the Government, Jose Duarte had manifested his militantism as early as  in subversive activities in the State of Sao Paulo. In  he had been arrested for having led movements supporting the reorganisation of an association prohibited by law. In  he had been identified under a false name as an agitator in several towns in the State of Sao Paulo. He had been spotted in  at meetings in support of armed revolution and reversal of the established order. He had been sentenced in  to one year's hard labour. Finally, in , he had been charged in the course of an inquiry opened in the State of Cear into subversive activities in that State. He was at present on the run. The Government pointed out that he had held no job for a long time and that he had been sentenced not on account of his trade union activities, but for breaches of national security legislation. The Government further stated that Jos Duarte had been sentenced after due trial, at which the rights of defence, full publicity for the proceedings and the right of appeal were assured.
.In November , the Committee noted that the Government had not replied to the allegations to the effect that Jos Duarte had been a trade union leader on the railways in the northeast of the country. It also drew attention to contradictions between the information provided by the complainants and that provided by the Government. According to the WFTU, Jose Duarte had been under arrest since  (the WFTU even named the place of detention); according to the Government he was on the run. On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body requested the Government to provide information on the factors which had led to the indictment against Jos Duarte in .
.The Government replied by a letter dated  February . In , it states, this person was reported to the public prosecutor for the Fourth Military Region for crimes against national security within the meaning of sections (IV),  and  of Act No. /. Finally, still for crimes against national security, he was sentenced by the court for the Tenth Military Judicial District to four years' hard labour for breaches of sections  and () and (II) of Legislative Decree No. /. Under the terms of section , ""reorganising or attempting to reorganise, de facto or de jure, even under a false name or in a simulated manner, an association or a political party dissolved in pursuance of a statutory provision or a court decision, or engaged in activities prejudicial or dangerous to national security, or enabling such an association or party to operate, under the same conditions, while it is legally suspended"", is punishable by from two to five years' hard labour. Under the terms of section  ""making subversive propaganda, () using any media for social communication such as newspapers, magazines, periodicals, books, bulletins, pamphlets, radio, television, cinema, theatre and other similar media as vehicles for hostile propaganda or psychological warfare or revolutionary or subversive warfare; (II) suborning persons at workplaces or educational establishments"", is punishable by from one to three years' hard labour.
.He was arrested, continues the Government, following investigations by the federal police in the State of Cear, where he was engaged in subversive activities. In prison, he was guilty of inciting prisoners to take part in a revolt, which finally involved all the prisoners. Contrary to the allegations, declares the Government, this person was under medical care while in prison and was visited by the doctor in the normal manner; his state of health was perfect when he left the prison. Upon completion of his sentence he was released, and went back into hiding; his whereabouts are unknown.
.The Government states that at Jos Duarte's trial his rights of defence were respected and that it was possible for him to appeal to the higher courts.
.According to the Government, this person has not engaged in any occupation or lawful activity for at least  years, and accordingly has no links with the trade union movement. Contrary to the allegations to the effect that he was a trade union leader on the railways in the north-east, the Union of Workers in the North-Eastern Railway Companies has stated that its records make no mention of any official or member by the name of Jos Duarte. Nor is his name to be found in the records of the Regional Delegation for Labour in the State of Pernambuco, where the union has its headquarters. The Government recalls that it has already forwarded statements by employers' and workers' Confederations attesting to the fact that nobody has been sentenced in Brazil for engaging in lawful trade union activities. All these facts, it concludes, together with those already examined by the Committee in connection with this case, suffice to prove that here again the person concerned was not a worker exercising any form of occupational activity whatsoever whose rights, protected by the ILO Conventions, might have been infringed. Jos Duarte served his sentence for activities contrary to the law, totally unconnected with trade union affairs.
.The Committee notes this information. It notes in particular that according to the Government, Jos Duarte was sentenced for breaches of Legislative Decree No. /, respecting national security, and that after serving his sentence he was released in perfect health. These statements contradict the allegations that this person has been detained without trial since  and subjected to ill-treatment. The Committee notes, however, that the Government has not supplied details of the concrete facts which led to his being sentenced to four years' hard labour.
.The Government repeats that Jos Duarte has not engaged in an occupation, and hence in trade union activities, for a number of years. The complainant organisation for its part, has not furnished particulars of the trade union activities in which this person is said to have engaged. The Committee regrets that it does not have fuller information on this case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note the Government's statement that Jos Duarte was sentenced to four years' hard labour for breaches of national security, and that he was released after serving his sentence.
.The complaint from the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a telegram of  November . The WFTU submitted additional information and new allegations in communications of  and  November ,  January  and  January . The Latin American Workers' Central (CLAT) also submitted a complaint, by a letter of  December . In a communication of  December , the World Confederation of Labour stated that it supported the allegations made by the CLAT.
.These complaints and the additional information were transmitted to the Government, which submitted comments by letters of  September and  November ,  February and  August .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU submitted the following allegations in its first communication. Joao Massena Mela, former secretary of the metalworkers' Union of Rio de Janeiro, had been arrested; Osvaldo Pacheco, former secretary of the Sao Paulo Dockworkers' Union, had been tortured; Vladimir Herzog, journalist with the cultural channel of the Sao Paulo television service had been killed; Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, president of the Maranhao Rural Workers, Union, already injured in , had been tortured again on  October . The complainants added, in their telegram of  November , that Manoel Constantino and Jos Cerreiro (see below) had been arrested arbitrarily with other trade union leaders.
.In its letter of  November , the WFTU stated that the families of the persons arrested had no idea where they were and suspected that they had been killed in prison. The complainants mentioned once again the names of Joao Massena Melo, arrested at the beginning of , and Osvaldo Pacheco, (who was also president of the National Federation of Stevedores); the latter was said to have been arrested",-1,1975,Brazil
115,"on  February  and to have been tortured so much that he lost his reason; the complainants attached the text of an open letter from his wife denouncing this violence. The WFTU referred again to the murder of Vladimir Herzog, director of the reporters division of the second channel of the Sao Paulo cultural television service.
.The complainants added that, since , the Brazilian trade union movement had been subjected to unremitting repression and interference on the part of the authorities. They quoted statements made to the press by several trade union leaders in Sao Paulo regarding deficiencies in the protection of trade union rights and the statement made by the Secretary for Public Safety in Sao Paulo to the effect that the repressive measures were caused by the state of war existing in the country. The WFTU referred again to the arrest, amongst others, of Manoel Constantino and Jos Cerreiro, president and vice-president respectively, of the Sao Caeteno Metalworkers' Union. It added that wages are fixed by the ministry of Labour without any consultation of the trade unions and that the latter are deprived of the fundamental right to defend the rights and uphold the demands of workers, in defiance of the law and international agreements signed by Brazil.
.In its complaint of  December , which is supported by the WCL, the CLAT pointed out that Manoel Conceicao dos Cantos, a peasant trade union leader, had been imprisoned four years ago. After two years' imprisonment during which, according to the complainants, he was subjected to torture, he was released in a serious condition. The Cardinal of Sao Paulo had to intervene in order to have him admitted to a hospital in which he underwent a surgical operation and subsequent treatment as an outpatient. The CLAT added that this same person was again imprisoned on  October  at Osasco (in the industrial zone of Sao Paulo) and that his present whereabouts were unknown, a fact which gave grounds to fear for his life. The CLAT also communicated a series of documents supporting its allegations.
.The WFTU further stated in its telegram of  January  that Jos Manoel Fiel Filho, a militant of the metalworkers' trade union had been killed on  January  after imprisonment by the armed forces. It also alleged, in its letter of  January , that Jos Duarte, trade union leader in the national railways of the north-east, had been detained without trial since . According to the WFTU, he was subjected to ill-treatment whilst in Bahia state prison and was today in a prison of the Paulo Sarasarte Penal Institute in the State of Cear. He was  years old and was said to have had a heart attack as a result of this bad treatment.
.In a communication of  September , the Government stated that Manoel Conceicao dos Santos had been sentenced to three years' imprisonment under section  of Legislative Decree No. /, which defines crimes against national security and political and social order. He had served his sentence and had been released on  May . He had been arrested again on  November  for questioning and released on  December . In its letter of  November , the Government stated that the Committee was not competent to examine this case, since it did not concern trade union leaders or militants. According to the Government, the persons named by the complainants did not exercise any administrative functions in a trade union, were not trade union militants and had not at any time been arrested in connection with trade union activity.
.In a subsequent letter of  February , the Government stated the reasons for which it had been unable to provide the information requested from it. It stated that under the Brazilian Constitutional system, the executive, legislative and judicial powers were independent of each other and under the judicial procedure, it was the executive power which started proceedings. Action had been started against the persons mentioned by the WFTU before the courts of the various national States and the accused had been suspended from work pending the court holidays (extending from the st (November ) to the nd (March ) Sessions of the Governing Body).
.In a detailed letter of  August , the Government stated that it had always expressed its support for the defence of human rights, which include trade union rights. Strict respect for the principles deriving from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Charter and the ILO Constitution, which were involved in the case under discussion, did not conflict with the respect of other essential principles of international coexistence, which prohibited interference in the internal affairs of a State and those relating to its sovereignty. The information which it provided, continued the Government, had to be examined in the light of the positions of principle upheld by Brazil before the Human Rights Commission and other bodies in which the many aspects of these provisions were discussed. It had submitted the information in a desire to maintain a constructive dialogue with the Committee, to tightening its bonds with ILO and in the conviction that the information provided would constitute a complete and final denial of the allegations which had been made.
.The Government further stated that there exists in Brazil an ordinary justice, organised in accordance with the standards of the Constitution, the competence of which corresponds to the universal principle of natural law. There are neither trial privileges nor exceptional courts; penal action is conducted by a court and a judge selected according to the cause of the litigation and not the persons accused; every person can appeal against a sentence. Defence rights are fully guaranteed.
.Moreover, added the Government, the Federal Constitution protects freedom of association and expression and the right to hold political and philosophical convictions. It simultaneously prohibits all propaganda in support of war or subversion and acts designed to create or strengthen prejudice or discrimination on grounds of religion, race or social status. Violations of national security legislation (Legislative Decree No. /) are also dealt with in accordance with ordinary procedure offering the aforementioned safeguards. The essential condition for any sentence based on this law is the existence of a specific fraudulent intention, the intention to prejudice or weaken internal or external state security. The Government has an obligation, it stated, to maintain the order essential for general well-being by assuring the country's development, and public security and peace. It was essential to prevent and, if necessary, to sanction acts designed to overthrow established order, destroy political institutions or harm progress and peace. Recourse was therefore had to the penal laws and the police system which these laws necessarily imply when offences are committed or when the State supposed, on the basis of well-established facts, that offences had been committed.
.The Government denied that there were political detainees in Brazil belonging to the trade union movement. Those of the persons mentioned by the complainants, who were the subject of criminal proceedings, had been accused of subversive acts; some had already been acquitted and others had been sentenced after being found guilty of violations of national security laws. They had been judged by ordinary courts, and had enjoyed the universal safeguards provided by penal procedure. The integrity and impartiality of the judges were proved by the acquittals pronounced on the grounds of inadequate legal proof and not because of the innocence of the accused persons, whose subversive activities were well known. With the exception of two cases, the Government emphasised, the persons mentioned in the complaints were not even associated with the trade union movement when they performed the illegal acts which led to their detention for the purposes of inquiry, or imprisonment on decision of the courts. The complainants had misrepresented the facts to make it appear that they affected trade union rights, which was not the case. The Government enclosed statements from employers' and workers' Confederations certifying that to the best of their knowledge nobody had been sentenced in Brazil on account of trade union activities.
.Regarding Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, the Government pointed out that he had been sentenced once for having organised the workers of several districts for political purposes, with a view to entering agricultural property, seizing land and installing peasants' families by force. The movement was directed against all owners in the area possessing enclosed properties. The enclosures were to be pulled down and destroyed, the occupants were to start collective farming there and the owners were to be prohibited passage over their own land. In the event of any of the latter reacting, they were to be assassinated by the farmers. A group of farmers, associated with the peasants' league, an illegal organisation, had destroyed the enclosures of several farm properties, under the leadership of Manoel Conceicao dos Santos.
.According to the Government, the person in question took part in clandestine activities, including guerrilla training, in the Pindare-Mirim valley in . In , he was injured during a clash",-1,1975,Brazil
116,"with the police and admitted to the Maranhao State Medical Centre. As a militant activist, he had followed courses in guerrilla warfare abroad. He had been jobless for a long time and had often been arrested for interrogation in the various States which he had visited. He had no trade union connection and lived in hiding; the Government had been informed of some of his travels abroad using false passports. The Government recalled that he had been released in May  and arrested again in Sao Paulo on  December  for interrogation, but had been released the following day. It stressed that this person was a typical subversive agent who had held no job for a long time and consequently had no connection with trade union life.
.Joao Massena Melo, continued the Government, had not held trade union office for  years and, moreover, had had no connection with any union whatsoever since . He devoted himself solely to terrorism, as he had done all his life, since he had been arrested and sentenced for illegal activities already in . He went on trial in  for subversion and had acted in a manner prejudicial to trade union life, and particularly in violation of section  of the consolidated labour legislation (conditions for the operation of trade unions).
.The Government explained that the Metalworkers' Union had been transformed at a certain stage into a centre for subversive agitation, although political and ideological propaganda were banned within organisations of that kind. Subversion had reached such a point within that union that ""the sailors' mutiny"" had set up its headquarters within it. Its leaders called for acts of indiscipline, rebellion and armed struggle amongst the personnel of the navy. The ""sailors' mutiny"", which almost led to civil war in the country, involved some dozens of rebelling soldiers who took up quarters at the union headquarters and were finally dislodged by the army in . The persons concerned were tried with those who had given them backing, including some of the union's leaders. The case came before the naval court, as it involved a crime against national security. The violations of trade union life had such far-reaching effects within this union that the Ministry of Labour was obliged to put it under guardianship and penal action was finally taken against the former leaders, who had acted as subversive agents, and were responsible for misappropriations and misuse of union property. The union's finances were compromised to such an extent that the organisation was unable to resume a normal existence for a long time, and not until the situation had been restored to order by a representative of the Ministry of Labour.
.Joao Massena Melo, continued the Government, carried out subversive activities clandestinely as leader of a prohibited political party. He had been sentenced to five years' imprisonment in , but did not serve his sentence, which has come under the statute of limitations. In , he had again been sentenced to two years' imprisonment following another trial for which he had been under preventive arrest. Penal action was brought against him in , but he was now living in hiding and his residence was unknown.
.According to the Government, Osvaldo Pacheo da Silva was one of the oldest and most active leaders of subversion in Brazil. He had been sought by the police during the s, at which time he had already ceased all trade union activity and had been struck off the stevedores' roll. He subsequently succeeded in being re-registered and becoming elected president of the National Port Workers' Federation. Action had been brought against him in  for subversive activities: he had stirred up about  political strikes in various essential services (ports, transportation, electric power), despite legal prohibition. He had been tried for subversive activities in , especially for having encouraged port workers to refuse all service on American ships anchored in the port of Santos. He was considered responsible in  for large-scale activities amongst peasants' leagues in rural areas. Osvaldo Pacheco who was associated with the Growers' and Agricultural Workers', Union of Brazil, an illegal organisation which sponsored the occupation of rural properties and encouraged other forms of violence, at the same time succeeded in setting up in the towns another underground organisation known as the Workers' General Command, the existence of which as a trade union organisation has never been authorised by law. In , he had been acquitted under the limitation of statutes in a trial in which he was accused of violation of the law on security and he left the country. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment on  May  for violation of sections  and  of the then existing law on national security (Act No. /). Having re-entered Brazil in  under a false identity, he exercised various activities in the State of Rio Grande do Sul; on  June , he was sentenced to four years' hard labour after trial for violation of section  of Legislative Decree No. / (reorganisation of an organisation which had been dissolved, suspended or which was prejudicial to national security). The Government emphasised that the person in question had held no trade union office since , in particular because he was no longer registered on the stevedores' roll. The complaint with regard to violation of trade union freedom, or ""torture"" was unfounded.
.The Government stated that Manoel Jos Constantino had been president of the Sao Caetano do Sul Metalworkers' Union, but had left on retirement. The Government also referred to Jos Ferreira da Silva - and not Jose Cerreiro - vice-president of the same union. These two persons had been arrested for an inquiry as investigations had shown that they had participated in the activities of subversive groups. Manoel Josh Constantino had been held from  to  October  for interrogation and had then been released. Jos Ferreira da Silva, who was responsible for organising subversive groups within plants, had been arrested on  October  and released the following  December. The results of the investigations had been transmitted to the courts, which had acquitted the two persons for lack of proof. The Government stressed that their detention and trial had no connection with their trade union activities.
.Jos Duarte, stated the Government, had manifested his militancy as early as , in subversive activities in the State of Sao Paulo. In , he had been arrested for having led movements supporting the reorganisation of an association prohibited by law. He had been identified under a false name in , as agitator in several towns in the State of Sao Paulo. He had been spotted in  at meetings in support of armed revolution and reversal of the established order. He was sentenced in  to one year's hard labour. Finally, in , he was charged in the course of an inquiry opened in the State of Cear for subversive activities in that State. He was at present on the run. The Government pointed out that the person concerned had held no job for a long time and that he had been sentenced not on account of his trade union activities, but for violations of national security legislation.
.The Government stated several times that these cases were not bound up with trade union activities and therefore did not fall within the terms of reference of the Committee. It added that Brazil did not submit its laws and court decisions to examination or appraisal, but in order to maintain the position of principle already referred to, it indicated the relevant regulations and provided data concerning the persons mentioned by the complainants. The Government stated that it accepted dialogue, but refused all interference in its internal affairs, such as the claim to the right to have examined by an international organisation with limited terms of reference, a matter not falling within those terms of reference. In full exercise of its sovereignty, continued the Government, Brazil ensured respect for its Constitution and other legislation and, in doing so, differed from no other country.
.The Government added that the persons referred to by the complainants had no need to be defended or protected against any danger whatsoever. Their rights and liberties had not been attacked. Three of them had been sentenced after due trial, at which the rights of defence, full publicity for the procedure and the right of appeal were at all times respected (Joao Massena Melo, Osvaldo Pacheco da Silva, Jos Duarte). The other three had been acquitted (Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, Manoel Jos Constantino, Jos Ferreira da Silva). Detention for interrogation had been carried out in accordance with legal police procedure and had been immediately notified to the competent judge. The detentions had been necessary to permit investigation of the responsibility of the persons engaged in illegal activities designed to overthrow established political institutions. The conclusions of the investigations carried out by the police authorities had been communicated to the Minister of the Public, for examination and transmission, if necessary, to",-1,1975,Brazil
117,"the courts. Of the six persons mentioned, only two (Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira da Silva) had been members of a union at the time of their short detention; they had been acquitted. The Government repeated that there was no link between the facts mentioned in the complaint and trade union rights.
.The Government then referred to the allegations regarding the death of Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho during their detention for interrogation with regard to subversive activities. It described in detail the investigations carried out after these two deaths and stated that the experts had arrived at the conclusion that the persons in question had committed suicide in prison without having been incited or helped. These conclusions had been transmitted to the judicial authorities, who had ordered the cases to be filed. Vladimir Herzog, added the Government, although a member of a union had never held union office; he had been arrested for activities prejudicial to national security. Regarding the arrest of Manoel Fiel Filho, this had no connection with the exercise of trade union rights.
.According to the Government, the persons mentioned in the complaints, with the exception of Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira da Silva, had no connection with the trade union movement at the time of their arrest or sentence. They were performing no functions at that time in the administration of the unions, were not militant trade unionists and had not been arrested for trade union activities. Consequently, the Government considers that the Committee is not called upon to consider these matters since its competence extends only to specific cases of violation of freedom of association.
.The Committee wishes to point out that it has frequently examined complaints concerning the detention of former trade union leaders with a view, particularly, to determining on the basis of all the available information, whether the measures taken against them were not related to their previous trade union activities. In the present case, several of the persons mentioned had previously held trade union office. At the same time, the Committee has always considered that when persons are sentenced on grounds having nothing to do with the exercise of trade union rights, the matter lies outside it terms of reference. It nevertheless has an obligation to check for itself, on the basis of all the information available, whether these persons were sentenced for acts covered by penal law or for trade union activities.
.In the case under consideration, the Committee notes in particular that Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira da Silva were acquitted by the courts for lack of proof, after several weeks' detention during the last quarter of .
.Regarding Joao Massena Melo and Osvaldo Pacheco, it seems clear that these persons had held no trade union office for a long time. Regarding Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, the information available shows that he had formed a peasants' union with a membership of around , in the north-east of the country, which had mainly participated in the occupation of land. On his release from prison in  he had sought to become a normal member of society by working as cabinet-maker in the south of the country. He had attended a seminar on active non-violence and had been arrested shortly after the meeting. Moreover, the information available does not make it possible to conclude whether Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho had performed activities or held office in a trade union. It consequently does not seem to appear from the information available to the Committee that the persons mentioned in this paragraph were arrested or sentenced for trade union activities.
.Regarding Jos Duarte, the Committee notes that the Government does not reply to the allegations made by the complainants to the effect that he had been a union leader on the railways in the north of the country.
.The Committee must also point out that it has before it allegations and public information to the effect that some of the persons mentioned in the complaint were subjected to ill-treatment. It notes that the Government's detailed rely in this connection is limited to the allegations concerning the deaths of Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho. The Committee has also noted certain contradictions between the information provided by the complainants and that provided by the Government. In particular, according to the complainants, Joao Massena Melo and Jos Duarte have been under arrest since the beginning of  and since , respectively (in the latter case, the WFTU even indicated the prison in which the person concerned is said to be held), but according to the Government these persons have fled or are in hiding.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira were acquitted by the courts;(b) to decide, for the various reasons set out in paragraph  above, no purpose would be served in continuing its examination of the allegations in respect of Joao Massena Melo, Osvaldo Pacheco, Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho;(c) to request the Government to provide information on the facts which led to the indictment against Jos Duarte in ;(d) to take note of this interim report.",-1,1975,Brazil
118,".The complaint, based on documents drawn up by the National Labour Front, dated  July  and  September , was submitted to the ILO by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) on  September .
.The complaint was duly transmitted to the Government which communicated its observations thereon on  January .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and. Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint concerns the situation of the workers of Portland Cement Company at Perus which is owned by a group named ""Abdalla"". As background information, the complainants give an account of the relations between the workers at Perus, who are the workers of the industrial, Cement, Lime and Plaster Workers' Union of Sao Paulo and the Abdalla group management and of the difficulties experienced by them in obtaining recognition of their trade, union rights. In particular, the complainants give an account of a strike in  as a result of which  workers were dismissed. Following a long court trial, which lasted until , these workers were reinstated with the right to reimbursement of all wages they had lost. According to the complainants, the total sum involved amounted, by today's standards, to some  million cruzeiros, but the greater part thereof was not claimed since more than  per cent of the workers concerned had died in the interval.
.The complainants add that, following the change of government in , their union was put under control by the authorities and the chief of personnel of the Perus was appointed union administrator, a post he occupied for one year. Between  and , continue the complainants, the Abdalla group did everything to hinder trade unionism. Workers in Perus were transferred to another undertaking in the group, named Socal, and if they refused they were dismissed. No one working in Socal was allowed to become a union member. Complaints were made to the Minister but no action was ever taken, except that the Minister stated that workers in Socal were entitled to become members of the Perus workers' union.
.In August , continue the complainants, the union brought charges against the directors of the Abdalla group undertakings, Perus and Socal, but after many months the affair was dropped by the police.
.The complainants add that between  and  the internal situation in the union deteriorated. The majority of the workers had no confidence in the union's president whose activities, including the suspension of an executive member of the union in September , were unpopular with the members. In January  the union appointed a Committee to examine its financial position and a number of irregularities were brought to light. The president was accorded a certain time in which to put matters right and refund missing sums. No report was made at that time to the Minister of Labour, but it appeared clear to the workers that the eventual intervention of the Government was made to protect the president and to favour the Abdalla group.
.The complainants add that, following further attempts to bring the Abdalla group to justice, the appropriate Ministry finally took action under the Penal Code on  May , denouncing the directors for, inter alia, failure to allow the workers to exercise their legal rights when transferring them, and preventing them from participating in the only local trade union. The court action, state the complainants, is being heard by the Federal Court in Sao Paulo. The workers realised that the only solution to the problem of recovering the  million cruzeiros awarded to them by the courts in  was the confiscation of the assets of the company.
.According to the complainants, at the end of June , a part of the company's assets was confiscated. The quarries, however, were left in the hands of the Abdalla group. The workers demanded that Socal (Abdalla group) which controlled the quarries at Cajamar be wound up.
.The complainants added that the president of the union, wishing to please both the workers and the Abdalla group at the same time, dismissed the union's legal adviser who had served the union for  years. This action was denounced by the workers who demanded a general meeting. This meeting could not, however, take place because the Minister, who according to the complainants did not want to see the president lose his office, put the union under government control.
.The workers, state the complainants, continued their efforts to obtain the reasons for the arbitrary decision of the president to dismiss the union's lawyer and for the intervention of the authorities. The information obtained by the workers indicated that the president himself had requested the intervention by the authorities. The president, add the complainants, was satisfied that a general meeting had been avoided, but he has since exercised no trade union duties nor does he have any contacts with the workers.
.The complainants add that, since the president had not been dismissed, they decided to draw the attention of the Minister of Labour to the irregularities discovered after the examination of the union's accounts.
.Although deprived of their union as a result of the government intervention, the workers continued their struggle, and in April  the union's lawyer was able to obtain access to the file containing the reasons for the intervention of the Government. According to the complainants, the lawyer was able to ascertain that it was the union's president himself who had requested the intervention on  November , on the grounds that he could no longer control the union and the workers had threatened him with violence and even with death. On the following day, the Minister of Labour confirmed the intervention by virtue of article  and () of the Labour Code.
.According to the complainants, the labour delegate of the Ministry had accepted - without any evidence - the slanderous accusations made by the president. The president had not, however, been suspended and could have returned to office, but he had last the confidence of the workers and his return would have brought up again the question of a general meeting. For these reasons, the minister prolonged the intervention indefinitely.
.The complainants state that it was only at the beginning of July  that the members of the temporarily-imposed executive Committee began to listen to the workers' claims and, at the time of lodging the complaint, the accounts were being examined by the Ministry.
.On  May , the complainants continue, a petition was addressed to the President of the Republic concerning the activities of the Abdalla group, and the workers recalled to the Minister of Labour the events which had led to the government intervention, requesting the reopening of their headquarters once a week for the purpose of meeting to discuss their problems, even in the presence of the officials of the Government. No response has been received from the Minister.
.In a further communication from the National Labour Front, dated  September , submitted by the World Confederation of Labour on  September , reference is made to the numerous interventions of the Brazilian Government in the activities of trade unions, and in particular to the intervention affecting the Union of Industrial, Cement, Lime and Plaster Workers.
.In its reply dated  January , the Government explains that for a number of years the industrial undertakings which formed part of the Abdalla group had established a system of work which was not in accordance with the labour laws, and that this had given rise on several occasions to court proceedings being taken against them at the instance of the workers.
.At the time, continues the Government, no intervention was considered necessary since questions involving labour and management are normally regulated by the labour courts which, in Brazil, are tripartite in character. Relations between labour and management, however, deteriorated and a series of strikes took place while court proceedings were going on. Two of these strikes lasted  and  days respectively. These strikes, states the Government, indicate in themselves that freedom of association is exercised. In Brazil, the right to strike is permitted under the Constitution and by Law No. /. In fact, continues the Government, the strike of  days was the beginning of a long legal battle against the Abdalla group which resulted in the group's being called upon to pay the sum of ,, cruzeiros to the  workers who had been unfairly dismissed.
.After a period of fairly reasonable relations between the workers and the employers, the Government was forced to take direct action against the group in order to protect the interests of the workers who were suffering from irregularities and even violence perpetrated by the employers. Contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Minister of Labour himself took court action against the Abdalla group, which ended in the confiscation of all the assets of the group. The facts show, states the Government, that a hard struggle was engaged in by the authorities in",-1,1974,Brazil
119,"order to defend the workers' interests.
.Apart from labour-management problems, continues the Government, the trade union of the workers had difficulties because of the disagreements which arose between the elected executive Committee and the lawyer for the complainant workers who was supported by certain members. These disagreements were so serious that they led to the dismissal of the lawyer. The Government adds, however, that it was in no way involved in this decision of the union. It was only when the duly elected leaders of the union recognised that they were no longer capable of managing the union, because of the atmosphere of hostility which prevailed between the various factions, that the Minister of Labour intervened.
.It is also necessary to point out, the Government adds, that when it received the initial communications from the trade union leaders concerning the disagreements between the groups of workers, it took the view that the matter lay outside its competence and that the workers themselves should resolve the problem. A communication had also been received by the Ministry from the workers pointing cut the serious disagreements and the irregularities within the union. According to the Government, this in itself shows the wisdom of the intervention of the Ministry following the request of the leaders of the union.
.The Government points out that it has always responded to claims made by the workers, while at the same time taking care not to take steps which might, directly or indirectly, adversely affect trade union activities. The Government could not remain indifferent to a union which was in a chaotic state because of internal problems. Other problems also arose between the union lawyer and the executive when the lawyer claimed as fees one half of the amount awarded by the court to the union.
.The closure of the union, claims the Government, was justified. Some groups had decided to take extreme measures, as had been stated by the union's president in a letter to the ministry in which he requested the Minister of Labour to protect the assets of the union and restore a situation of normalcy in its premises located in the undertaking. As regards the irregularities to which the complainants drew attention, the Government acted cautiously, using legal means to redress the situation. The Government points out that for a time after the confiscation of the factory at the Cajamar quarry, it remained under the control of the Abdalla group, but in the name of a trustee. The Government completed an inventory of the assets of Cajamar before any radical steps were taken. At present the Cajamar quarry was sequestrated and the workers were completely free to defend their interests. The complaint, therefore, states the Government, has become devoid of substance as a result of subsequent developments.
.The Government explains that its decision to confiscate was facilitated by the fraud which had been perpetrated by the Abdalla group against the Treasury. The activities of the group had been closely watched by the Government since , and all steps were taken thereafter to confiscate and reimburse the Treasury as well as to indemnify the workers. The Government could be blamed for some delays caused by bureaucratic conflicts between various administrative departments, but the workers had not helped the situation by addressing their complaints at various times to different government services.
.As for the allegation that the company put obstacles in the way of the workers who wished to belong to a union, the Government states that this matter is being dealt with by the federal police. Moreover, the Government adds, it sent secretly more than  labour inspectors at the same time to investigate the Abdalla group undertakings, and their report contains information on labour conditions which justifies the action subsequently taken against the company. Action was taken through the local labour division in Sao Paulo against the group, as well as through the federal police and the department of public security.
.The Government adds that, even if the union's lawyer has ceased to work for the union, the workers' interests are properly defended and their rights respected. Strikes took place when the workers deemed this appropriate, collective agreements were signed when agreement was reached and trade union activity followed its normal course so long as it was able to maintain a properly elected executive. This executive was only set aside when it declared itself no longer capable of fulfilling its role. The Government, in the exceptional circumstances which prevailed, only intervened at the request of the properly elected executive.
.No judicial appeal, however, states the Government, has been made either by the workers or by the former union lawyer against the intervention. In fact, states the Government, the measures were taken to ensure the very survival of the union. Once the confiscation of the factory was completed, the Minister of Labour took care to appoint an executive Committee of the union consisting of members of the organisation and this Committee is now seeking to restore a normal situation with a view to holding elections.
.The Government states that the Minister acted in the only way possible in such a situation and never previously have workers and Government acted so much in common than in the matter which ended in the confiscation of the assets of the Abdalla group.
.On several occasions in the past the Committee has been called upon to deal with cases concerning intervention by the Government of Brazil in the internal affairs of trade unions. In, these cases the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee has also pointed out that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting this right.
.Moreover, the Committee has stated in a number of cases that the principles of freedom of association do not prohibit control of the internal activities of a trade union when the latter infringes the law (which should not, however, be such as to undermine the principles of freedom of association), but it has considered it to be of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, the control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.Matters involving no dispute between the Government and the trade unions but solely consisting in a conflict within the trade union movement itself are the sole responsibility of the parties themselves. For this reason, the Committee is not called upon to examine questions concerning the relations within the union involved in the complaint and in particular the accusations brought by the complainants against the union's president and the dismissal of the union's legal adviser.
.As regards the intervention in the union by the authorities, however, the Committee notes that it commenced as long ago as September  and that it still continues. From all the information at its disposal the Committee notes that the internal affairs of the union were in a state of disorder and workers attempted to call a general meeting. This general meeting could have resulted in a settlement of the internal problems. Because of the intervention of the authorities which was called for by the president, however, the general meeting could not be held.
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations contained in paragraphs  to  above, and in particular to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to request the Government to take appropriate measures to bring to an end the intervention which commenced as long ago as September  and to enable elections to be held for the appointment of a new executive Committee in the Union of Industrial, Cement, Lime and Plaster Workers; and(c) to request the Government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee, to inform the Committee prior to its session in November  of the measures taken to allow elections in the above-named organisation.",-1,1974,Brazil
120,".The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is contained in a letter dated  April , and the Government's reply in a communication dated  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After recalling other cases relating to Brazil which have come before the Committee, the WFTU states that the military police of Sao Paulo (Ninth Battalion) have sent out to undertakings in that state a ""secret industrial questionnaire"", a copy of which it appends. According to the complainants this questionnaire was despatched in pursuance of general instructions given by the Brazilian military authorities and is proof that trade union rights no longer exist in Brazil, and that the authorities are seeking by such means to exercise control over undertakings, their owners and their workers and to channel to their advantage the workers' claims and any demand for respect for freedom of association. The WFTU also calls for the release of trade unionists in prison, the cancellation of proceedings brought against them and the quashing of any sentences passed.
.This questionnaire contains a list of sixty points relating to various subjects. Some are concerned with the identification of the undertaking, its owners, its management, its parent company, if any, its production, etc.; others concern the existence of a security department, a fire-fighting section, a works canteen, accommodation, a sports ground and a civil defence plan yet other questions ask the number of employees, their average age, how they are paid. There is also a question as to whether any employees belong to the military police or the armed forces.
.The questionnaire also asks whether there are any natural leaders among the employees (requesting their names, addresses and jobs in the undertaking), people who incite to strike, trade union delegates or trade union organisations represented in the undertaking (one question asks what ends they pursue and what their relations are with the management; another queries the links between employees and unions).
.The Government protests at the way in which the WFTU has attempted to link its accusations with other cases that the ILO has examined previously on the basis of information officially challenged by the Government. It denies that the questionnaire was drawn up following general instructions given by the military authorities, stating that it was undertaken on the initiative of a battalion commander who wished to conduct a survey to help him in his preventive activities in that part of the city under his supervision (the Government points out, moreover, that the situation there is normal, as it is throughout the country). The Government goes on to state that this document has nothing to do with trade union matters but forms part of a general survey of undertakings, a confidential inquiry, of a kind carried out as a matter of course in any country, undertaken by the police for preventive purposes. The questionnaire relates solely to questions of industrial safety, civil defence, and other matters essential for the preparation of police protection plans. The Government considers that this affair is not a matter for the Committee as it has no connection with the activity of trade union organisations or with the rights of individuals, let alone the rights of trade unions.
.The Government adds that the WFTU offers no evidence in support of its allegations and is unable to quote a single event which has taken place as a result of this survey. The survey will not give rise to action of any kind against any person whatsoever except in cases of emergency or serious public disturbance; no action has been taken as a result of it and no person has suffered any infringement of his rights. The Government goes on to state that the trade unions in Brazil are operating in a peaceful and constructive social climate and are fully devoted to furthering the interests of the workers; they have not even taken cognisance of the facts reported by the WFTU, since these are irrelevant to their true objectives. The accusations made by the WFTU imply that the police should be debarred from conducting inquiries, from obtaining advance knowledge of the presence of persons likely to disturb public order and from obtaining the information which will -permit them to act promptly and effectively when required to do so.
.It emerges from the information available that the Ninth Battalion of the military police of Sao Paulo has drawn up and sent out to undertakings in the area a secret questionnaire referring to various aspects of the affairs of these undertakings, including the trade unions and leaders of the workers and likely instigators of strikes.
.The Committee notes the Government's explanations and its statement to the effect that this questionnaire has no bearing upon the present position of trade unionists. According to the Government it is a practice of a kind engaged in as a matter of course in any country.
.The Committee is of the opinion that the sending of such a questionnaire to undertakings by the military authorities is not in accordance with normal practice. In many countries records are kept by labour departments concerning trade unions and their leaders, but the situation is different when it is the military authorities which ask for information, especially on the natural leaders of the workers and likely instigators of strikes.
.The Committee considers that an inquiry into such matters may involve a risk of being put to improper use by the military authorities or the police in the event of a labour dispute (for example, workers might be taken into custody simply because they are on a list of persons thus established, even though they have committed no offence). The Committee points out, moreover, that this danger is implicit in the Government's statement to the effect that the questionnaire will not give rise to action of any kind against individuals ""except in cases of emergency or serious public disturbance"". The Committee further considers that this method is likely to create such an atmosphere of mistrust that it is hardly an appropriate means of furthering the development of harmonious industrial relations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above and to request the Government to take appropriate measures to avoid risks of the kind mentioned.",-1,1974,Brazil
121,".The complaint from the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  February . The complaint was transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations in a letter dated  January .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). It has, however, ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU alleged that the National Confederation of Credit Employees (CONTEC), an organisation with , members (bank and insurance employees), had its Executive Committee appointed direct by the Ministry of Labour after the latter had vetoed the Committee elected democratically by the members of CONTEC.
.The WFTU encloses with its communication an article from the magazine Folha Bancaria (dated November-December ) dealing with the matter. The article states that a Decree dated  October  replaced the Executive Committee of CONTEC by a Supervisory Committee (Junta interventora), substituting a representative of the Ministry of Labour for one of its members. Two bank employees were accepted by the Ministry to make up a three-man supervisory board but these employees resigned from the board, thus leaving the Confederation entirely in the hands of the third member, an official of the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare.
.The article adds that elections for a new Executive Committee were to be held on  October  but that the Ministry of Labour vetoed the candidature of ten persons, whose names were on the proposed single list, thus preventing the elections from taking place. In particular the veto concerned the economist, Ruy de Brito, who had been the CONTEC leader for some years. Nevertheless the Department of Security and Information of the Ministry of Labour informed several trade union leaders that this veto did not mean that Ruy de Brito was considered to be ""a Communist or corrupt"". According to the newspaper Estato de Sao Paulo, the opinions of Ruy de Brito on the subject of the Government's wages policy, the Length of Service Guarantee Fund, the Social Integration Plan and his own central trade union organisation were enough to prevent his candidature from being accepted.
.Quoting another newspaper, the periodical Folha Bancaria states that Ruy de Brito had fallen out of favour with the Ministry of Labour. According to various sources and in particular to Ruy de Brito himself, this was because of the opinions he had expressed on various social issues. In particular he had protested against the interference of the Ministry of Labour in the affairs of the bank employees' union of Guanabara.
.The Government, in its communication, states that the complaint is unjustified under Brazilian domestic law. The Government specifies that, under section  of the consolidation of Labour Laws, trade unions are not authorised to exercise political activities. However, the Government adds, the CONTEC executive carried on political activities completely contrary to the law by spreading doctrines incompatible with the national institutions. Moreover, activist groups belonging to a party that is not recognised by law are said to have met at the union's headquarters. Consequently, the Ministry was obliged to inform the CONTEC executive that it did not meet the legal requirements for re-election.
.The Government adds that since the union was unable to agree on the new candidates to be presented for election, a provisional administration had to be organised. To make up this interim body, the union proposed two bank employees and the Ministry of Labour an accountant. The civil servant, the Government points out, was therefore in the minority, but since the employees resigned, the Ministry of Labour had to appoint substitutes while awaiting the next elections.
.Lastly, the Government states that the present executive of the union is of a purely temporary nature, that it is merely carrying out routine functions until new elections are held and that it is the consequence of a crisis caused by the former administration.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the political activities of the executive of CONTEC are the cause of the measures taken against it. The Committee thinks it appropriate to recall the opinion it has expressed that if trade unions are prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities this may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given to such provisions in practice may change at any moment and considerably restrict the possibility of action of the organisations. It would therefore seem that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms political activities by occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of their members.
.Moreover, in a number of cases, the Committee has stated that the principles of freedom of association do not prohibit control of the internal activities of a trade union when the latter infringes the law (which should not, however, be such as to undermine the principles of freedom of association), but it has considered it to be of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, the control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.As regards the measures taken against the executive of CONTEC, the Committee notes that for more than  months the Confederation has been managed by a body appointed by the Ministry of Labour and that apparently it has not been possible to organise elections because this Ministry has vetoed certain candidates.
.The Committee wishes to recall in this connection that in previous cases concerning Brazil, it has considered that the placing of trade union organisations under control entailed a serious danger of restricting the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee has also pointed out that the removal from office of trade union leaders in cases where infringements of the law or of the internal rules have been proved as well as the appointment of temporary administrators, should be effected through the courts. The Committee has also considered that, for the taking over of a union by the authorities to be admissible, it must be temporary and designed solely to allow free elections to be organised.
.The Committee has, moreover, always emphasised the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs , , ,  and  above and in particular to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to invite the Government to take the necessary measures for free elections to be held as soon as possible in order to appoint a new executive of CONTEC;(c) to invite the Government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee, to inform it, before the Committee's session in November , of the measures taken to allow free elections to be held.",-1,1973,Brazil
122,".The Committee last examined this case at its st Session, held in Geneva on  May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (Geneva, - June ).
.After the Committee's last examination of the case, only one series of allegations - those concerning the arrest and death of the trade unionist Olavo Hansen - remained outstanding.
.The allegations concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen had been made by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) in a communication dated  June , by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) in a communication dated  June  and by the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in a communication dated  June . The Government had forwarded its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The complainants maintained that a Sao Paulo trade unionist, Mr. Olavo Hansen, had been arrested together with sixteen of his colleagues during the officially authorised May Day celebrations at the ""Maria Zlia"" sports ground in Sao Paulo. It was further alleged that Mr. Hansen had been subjected to lengthy interrogation by the political police (DEOPS) and so badly treated that when he got back to his cell he could no longer stand. For several days he was said to have been left lying on his bed, unable to get up, speak or even urinate. On  May his corpse was found near the Ipiranga Museum, covered with lesions and bruises resulting from the brutal torture inflicted on him. His death was officially registered on  May  but his family was informed only on  May  (the date on which his corpse was discovered).
.The Government forwarded its observations on the above allegations in its communication of  October . The Government's reply consisted essentially summary of the report to the examining magistrate on the official investigation carried out by the Public Prosecutor's office to determine the causes of Olavo Hansen's death. According to this document, Olavo Hansen and others were arrested on  May  at the ""Villa Maria Zlia"" sports stadium and a police inquiry was ordered into their attempted breach of the security of the State, which consisted in the distribution of subversive pamphlets. According to the Government, Hansen was a militant member of the Trotskyist wing who had already been brought to trial before a military court in  and maintained contact with individuals charged with crimes against national security, besides being an agent for the newspaper Frente Operaria (an organ of the Revolutionary Workers' Labour Party).
.The Government further stated that after Hansen had been handed over to the No.  Police Battalion and then to the ""Operaao Bandeirantes"" (OBAN), he was interrogated by the Department of Political and Social Order (DEOPS) on  May . Mr. Dias, who carried out the preliminary questioning, noted that at the time ""he showed no signs of any injury or ill treatment"".
.The Government added that on  May, Hansen said he did not feel well and asked for a doctor. He was examined by Dr. Ciscato (the physician at the policlinic of the DEOPS), who ordered him to be taken to the military hospital at So Paulo, where he was given a bed and suitable treatment. Hansen died at about  a.m. on the following morning ( May); the cause of death was established by the doctor on duty at the military hospital as kidney failure due to a chronic, and finally acute, condition. The post mortem report of the same date stated that internal examination of the body was negative from the anatomo-pathological and forensic standpoints. However, a toxicological examination of the stomach content, of the liver and of the blood sample was positive in revealing the presence of the insecticide ""Paration"".
.The Government further stated that up to the evening before his arrest, Mr. Hansen had been working at the ""Industria Agro-Pecuaria"", an undertaking which handles fertilizers and insecticides, some of the latter containing a product called ""Paration"". While it had not been established that he had any of this product on his person at the time of his arrest, the police thought it possible that he might have had some hidden in his clothing or about his person. The Government further advised that Dr. Ciscato, who had been called out on the night of  May to examine Hansen, had claimed that Hansen had told him that he had suffered from kidney trouble for many years and was undergoing treatment for it. Dr. Ciscato was of the opinion that Hansen's death was due to kidney failure.
.The Government stated in conclusion that the investigation into the cause of Mr. Hansen's death had revealed poisoning by the insecticide ""Paration"" as the most likely cause of death, since all the evidence showed that at the time of his arrest he either had a quantity of this poison on his person or else was suffering from chronic poisoning which led to kidney failure. The Government accordingly maintained that since he had been in this condition prior to his admission to the military hospital, and since he had received proper medical treatment at the hospital, his death was due to natural causes and could not therefore be attributed to any third parties.
.At its session in February , the Committee noted, from the Government's observations, that an inquiry had been held which had concluded that no third party could be held responsible for Hansen's death. It had felt bound to point out, however, that while the inquiry had concluded that Mr. Hansen had died on  May  as a result of ""Paration"" poisoning operating on a kidney condition, the Government had not presented any comments or observations with regard to the allegation that Hansen's bruised and battered corpse had been found outside the Ipiranga Museum on  May , the day on which his family was notified of his death. The Committee considered that it required further information from the Government in order to enable it to reach its conclusions on this aspect of the complaint.
.The Committee accordingly recommended the Governing Body: (i) to request the Government to supply detailed information concerning the procedure followed during the interrogation of Mr. Olavo Hansen; (ii) to request the Government to communicate its observations concerning the allegations according to which the body of Olavo Hansen was found, covered with lesions and bruises, near the Ipiranga Museum on  May , as well as the text of the judgement delivered and the grounds adduced therefor.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government confined itself to repeating that Mr. Hansen had died in the military general hospital of Sao Paulo, a fact which, in its opinion, removed any basis from the allegations referred to in the preceding paragraph.
.At its session in November  the Committee, in the hope of clarifying the matter, requested the complainants to furnish any further precise information and evidence at their disposal concerning this aspect of the case.
.At its May  Session, the Committee noted that it had received no new information with regard to this particular aspect of the case.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body: (a) to note once again, the serious nature of the allegations relating to the circumstances of Mr. Olavo Hansen's death; (b) to give the complainants a further opportunity of supplying the information mentioned in paragraph  above and to request the Government once again to supply the information specified in paragraph  above.
.Subsequently the WFTU, in a communication dated  June , states that it has been assured by Brazilian trade unionists of the truth of the information related in paragraph  above. The WFTU encloses extracts from Brazilian newspapers of the time referring to the violent death of Mr. Olavo Hansen at the hands of the political police.
.The WFTU states in its communication that the Member of Parliament and leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), Mr. Pedroso Horta, raised the question of Mr. Hansen's death in the Chamber of Deputies, demanding that the Government order an inquiry into Hansen's death in the Santo Andr prison and take steps to ensure that the torturers were punished. The deputy chief of the party in power (Alianza Renovadora), Mr. Cantidio Sampao, is said to have stated that an inquiry would be instituted and would result in those responsible being punished, ""for the Government did not approve of such acts"".
.The WFTU goes on to say that on the same day another Member of Parliament, Humberto Lucena, mounted the rostrum of the Chamber of Deputies to read a telegram sent by the Sao Paulo trade unions to the President of the Republic, ""informing him of Olavo Hansen's assassination by the political police in Santo Andr prison"". After hearing this denunciation, Mr. Cantidio Sampao is reported to have stated that it was surprising in the circumstances that the cause of Olavo Hansen's death was said to be ""unknown"", as",-1,1970,Brazil
123,"it had been by the Institute of Forensic medicine.
.The WFTU states that finally Mr. Olavo Hansen's parents went to the Chamber of Deputies to ask Mr. Pedroso Horta, leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, to secure condemnation of ""the criminal act committed by the political police"". Pedroso Horta is said to have told Mr. Hansen's parents that there was no point in continuing their efforts ""because the Government enjoyed a substantial majority in Parliament and it was impossible to obtain an inquiry"".
.In conclusion, the WFTU states: ""Olavo Hansen's death in the So Paulo prison made a very great impression on the Brazilian trade unions and also on public opinion. By its systematic refusal to hold an inquiry, as proposed in the Chamber of Deputies and by the trade union organisations of Sao Paulo, the: Government of Brazil merely admits to the crime committed against the worker Olavo Hansen, who was employed in the So Paulo chemical industry and was a member of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union of Santo Andr and Maria"".
.For its part, the Government supplied further observations in a communication dated  October .
.In this communication, the Government points out that the further information supplied on  June  by the WFTU - the text of which had been passed on to it - adds nothing to the complaint lodged by this organisation on  June  since, states the Government, this information is confined to a very one-sided summary of information published by certain newspapers at the time of Mr. Hansen's death, when the result of the inquiry held by the judicial authorities had not yet been made known.
.The Government considers that all the questions raised by Mr. Hansen's death were sufficiently clarified in its first letter of  October , in which all the information supplied to the Ministry of Labour and social welfare by the competent bodies of the judicial authorities were duly communicated to the Committee. The Government nevertheless presents the observations dealt with in the following paragraphs.
.The case concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen, states the Government, as it has always maintained, has no connection with the exercise of trade union activities. The real nature of the activities in which Mr. Hansen was engaged at the time of his arrest is clearly shown by the texts that he and his companions were distributing. These texts aimed above all at inciting workers to subversion against law and order and were signed by the ""Revolutionary Labour Party, Brazilian Section of the Fourth International"".
.The Government repeats that Mr. Olavo Hansen died at the general military hospital of So Paulo, where he had been taken urgently to receive the medical treatment required by an acute condition of kidney failure. After being examined by a group of doctors from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the body was returned to the family for burial. The experts stated that the cause of death was a kidney condition that had never been properly treated.
.The Government admits that this case was discussed in the Brazilian press as well as in the National Congress. It adds that this merely serves to show the existence in Brazil of normal freedom of expression, making it possible to throw light on such questions. Furthermore, states the Government, ""it cannot be said, without distorting the truth, that the Brazilian Government opposed an inquiry into the matter: the Chamber of Deputies did not consider it advisable to hold such an inquiry in view of the fact that in the particular case of Mr. Hansen's death a judicial inquiry had immediately been opened by the judge presiding over the second military judicial circumscription, on the order of the Secretary for Public Safety of the State of So Paulo"".
.The Government of Brazil - the reply continues - considers the matter closed. It has been dealt with by a court decision, dated  December , in which the judge concluded, after examining all the facts, that Mr. Hansen died a natural death due to an acute condition of kidney failure. The legal procedure followed its normal course and the case has now been disposed of. Consequently the Brazilian Government has no right to reopen it.
.By a communication dated  January  addressed to the Director-General, the Federation of Workers in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of Sao Paulo, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliate, the Union of Workers in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of Santo Andr, requests that the case concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen should be dismissed; in support of this request, the organisation concerned stresses that the matter has been elucidated in a satisfactory manner by the competent national bodies.
.Having taken note of this communication, the Committee notes that it emanates from an organisation which is not a complainant. Since the original complainants have themselves not withdrawn their complaints, and since both the WCL and the Government have supplied new information on the substance of the matter, the Committee considers that the communication from the Federation of Workers in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of So Paulo should not cause it to discontinue its examination of the case, and it considers that the case should be examined on its merits.
.The Committee notes the observations of the Government contained in its communication of  October  and set out in paragraphs  to  above. It regrets, however, that the Government has refrained from supplying, as it had been requested, precise information as to the procedure followed in interrogating Mr. Hansen, and its observations on the specific allegations according to which the body of Mr. Hansen, who died on  May , was found covered with bruises on  May near the Ipiranga Museum. This information would have been useful in attempting to shed light on the facts referred to in the complaints.
.Despite its repeated efforts to obtain information likely to help it in establishing the truth on the disturbing circumstances surrounding Mr. Olavo Hansen's death, the Committee is obliged to recognise that, since it first began its examination of this case, there have been two conflicting versions of what took place, which makes it impossible for it to express an opinion in full knowledge of the facts.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the further information supplied by the World Federation of Trade Onions, set out in paragraphs  to  above, as well as the observations of the Government contained in the communication of  October  and set out in paragraphs  to  above;(b) to regret that the Government has refrained from supplying the precise information requested on the points mentioned in paragraph  above, which information would have been useful in attempting to shed light on the facts referred to in the complaints; and(c) to deplore the fact that, despite its repeated efforts to secure information likely to help it in establishing the truth surrounding the circumstances of Mr. Olavo Hansen's death, the Committee, and subsequently the Governing Body, remains faced with two conflicting versions of the facts and is therefore unable to express an opinion concerning allegations of the utmost gravity.
.The Committee last examined this case at its th Session, held in Geneva on  November , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.After the Committee's last examination of the case, two series of allegations remained outstanding; those relating to the arrest of Messrs. Herval Arueira and Demisthoclides Batista, and those relating to the arrest and death of Mr. Olavo Hansen.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, that the allegations relating to Messrs. Herval Arueira and Demisthoclides Batista do not call for further examination;(b) as regards the allegations relating to Mr. Olavo Hansen:(i) to note, once again, the serious nature of the allegations relating to the circumstances surrounding the death of the person concerned;(ii) to accord once again to the complainants the opportunity of supplying any precise information and evidence at their disposal concerning this aspect of the case;(iii) to request the Government, once again, to communicate detailed information concerning the procedure followed during the interrogation of Mr. Olavo Hansen, and supply its observations concerning the allegations that the body of Olavo Hansen was found covered with lesions and contusions near the Iparanga Museum on  May ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when the information referred to above has been received.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its session in February , when it submitted an interim report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March ). In this report, certain additional information was requested from the Government,",-1,1970,Brazil
124,"it being understood that the Committee would submit a further report as soon as the said information had been received.
.The Government has forwarded two further communications relating to the matter dated respectively  and  October .
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen:(i) to express its regret that the Government has failed to supply the information which had been requested concerning allegations of a most serious nature;(ii) to note that, in view of the contradictions which exist between the allegations formulated and the information supplied by the Government, the Committee has decided to request the complainants to furnish any precise information and evidence at their disposal concerning the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Olavo Hansen and the discovery of his body;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the other detained persons, to request the Government to supply the text of the provisions of Law No.  of , which Messrs. Demisthoclides Batista and Herval Arueira are said to have violated, and the text of the judgements delivered against the persons concerned, together with the grounds adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information requested from the complainants and from the Government in accordance with subparagraphs (a) (ii) and (b) above.
.The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) is set forth in a communication dated  June ; that of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) in a communication dated  June  and that of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in a communication dated  June .
.On  July  the texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government for its observations. The Government replied by a communication dated  October .
.On  November  the WCL communicated a number of further allegations. On  December  the text of the communication was transmitted to the Government for its observations. To date no reply has been received from the Government on the subject of these latest allegations.
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege in their communications of June  that a trade unionist of So Paulo, Mr. Olavo Hansen, was arrested together with sixteen of his colleagues during the officially authorised May Day celebrations at the sports ground "" Maria Zlia "" in So Paulo. It is further alleged that Hansen was subjected to lengthy interrogation by the Political Police (the DOPS) and so badly treated that when he got back to his cell he could no longer stand. For several days he was abandoned to his cot; he could neither get up, nor speak, nor urinate. On  May his corpse was found near the Ipiranga Museum: it was covered with lesions and contusions-the product of the brutal tortures to which he had been subjected. His death was officially registered on  May , but his family was only informed on  May  (the date on which his corpse was discovered).
.In addition to the allegations relating to the arrest, torture and killing of Mr. Olavo Hansen, two of the complainants (the WCL and the WFTU) allege (without, however, giving details) that a similar fate befell Mr. Salvador Tolezano who was, at the time of his death, a leader of the Bank Employees' Union. The Committee dealt with these allegations in its th Report (see Case No. ).
.Two of the complainants (the WCL and CLASC) ask for the establishment by the ILO of a commission of inquiry to carry out an on-the-spot investigation in Brazil in view of the repeated and serious infringements of freedom of association and human rights in that country.
.The WCL in its communication of  November  alleges that a number of other trade union leaders have been persecuted as follows for carrying out trade union activities: Victorio Chinagli, President of the Male Nurses' Union of Campinas (State of So Paulo), was kept in custody from April until August  and was maltreated by the police during interrogation; Dr. Marco Aurelio, a trade union counsel working in Campinas (State of So Paulo), was kept in custody during the month of April and was tortured during the preliminary interrogation; it is not known whether or not be is still in prison; Aristocles Batista, President of the Railwaymen's Union, Ferro Leopoldina (Rio de Janeiro), has been condemned to eight years' imprisonment; Ahuera, also from Ferro Leopoldina, has been condemned to several years' imprisonment after having been tortured while awaiting trial.
.The Government, in its communication of  October , replies to the complainants' allegations concerning Mr. Olavo Hansen. The Government's reply essentially consists in a summary Magistrate of an official investigation carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office to determine the cause of death of Mr. Olavo Hansen. According to this information, Olavo Hansen and certain others were arrested on  May  at the "" Vila Maria Zlia "" Sports Stadium and a police inquiry was initiated into their attempt against the security of the State, that is to say, for having distributed subversive pamphlets. The Government advises that Hansen was a militant member of the Trotskyist wing who had already been brought to trial before a military court in  and who maintained contact with individuals charged with crimes against national security as well as being an agent for the newspaper "" Frente Operaria "" (an organ of the Revolutionary Workers' Labour Party).
.The Government further states that "" after Hansen had passed through the No.  Police Battalion and the Operao Bandeirantes (OBAN) "", he was interrogated by the Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS) on  May . Mr. Dias, who carried out the preliminary questioning, noted that at the time "" he showed no signs of any injury or ill treatment "".
.It is further stated that on  May Hansen said he did not feel well and asked for a doctor. He was examined by Dr. Ciscato (the physician of the Policlinic of the Department of Political and Social Order), who ordered him to be taken to the Army General Hospital in Rio Paulo, where he was given a bed and suitable treatment. He died at about  a.m. the following morning ( May): the cause of death was established by the duty doctor at the hospital as being kidney failure due to a chronic and finally acute condition. The post-mortem report of the same date stated that internal examination of the body was negative from the anatomopathological and forensic standpoints. However, a toxicological examination of the stomach content, of the liver and of a blood sample was positive in revealing the existence of the insecticide "" Paration "".
.The Government further states that up to the evening of his arrest Hansen had been working at the "" Industria Agro-Pecuaria "", an undertaking which handles fertilisers and insecticides, the latter including a product called "" Paration "". While it was not established that he had any of this product on his person at the time of his arrest the police thought it possible that he might have had some hidden in his clothing or about his person. The Government further advises that Dr. Ciscato claims that when he examined Hansen on the night of  May, Hansen told him that he had long suffered from kidney trouble and was in fact undergoing treatment for it: Dr. Ciscato was of the opinion that Hansen died from kidney failure.
.The Government states, in conclusion, that the investigation into the cause of Hansen's death revealed exogenous poisoning by the insecticide "" Paration "" (as the most likely cause of death) since all the evidence went to show that at the time of his arrest he had either a quantity of this poison on his person, or else was suffering from chronic poisoning which led to kidney failure. The Government accordingly maintains that since he was in this condition prior to his admission to the military hospital and since he received proper medical treatment at the hospital, his death was natural and could not therefore be attributed to any third parties.
.In cases of this kind, where it is alleged that the death of a person has a direct bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee has invariably stressed the desirability of the Government instituting an immediate and impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and to determine responsibilities. In the present case it would appear from the Government's reply that an inquiry was held and that the inquiry concluded that no third party could be held responsible for Hansen's death.
.The Committee, however, feels bound to point out that while the inquiry concluded that Hansen died on  May  as a result of "" Paration """,-1,1970,Brazil
125,"poisoning operating on a kidney condition, the Government does not present any comments or observations with regard to the allegation that Hansen's bruised and battered corpse had been found outside the Museum of Ipiranga on  May , the day on which Hansen's family were notified of his death. The Committee requires further information from the Government in order to enable it to come to conclusions on this part of the complaint. Accordingly, it recommends the Governing Body to ask the Government for its observations on these allegations together with the text of the decision rendered by the court and the grounds adduced therefor.
.As regards the requests made by CLASC and the WCL on  and  June  respectively for the establishment by the ILO of a commission of inquiry to carry out an on-the-spot investigation in Brazil in view of the repeated and serious infringements of freedom of association and human rights in that country, the Committee considers it premature to make any recommendation concerning these requests until the Government has had an opportunity of providing this further information.
.In all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) (i) to take note of the inquiry instituted by the Government to determine the probable cause of Mr. Olavo Hansen's death;(ii) to ask the Government to explain in detail the procedure followed in the interrogation of Mr. Olavo Hansen;(iii) to ask the Government for its observations on the allegations according to which Mr. Olavo Hansen's bruised and battered corpse was found outside the Museum of Ipiranga on  May , together with the text of the decision rendered by the court and the grounds adduced therefor;(b) to request the Government to furnish its observations on the allegations relating to Messrs. Victorio Chinagli, Aristocles Batista and Ahuera and Dr. Marco Aurelio;c) to take note of this interim report on the understanding that it will submit a further report when it has received the additional information requested from the Government in sub-paragraphs (a) (ii) and (b) above.Geneva,  February .

126,".The complaint made by the Federation of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of So Paolo is set forth in a communication dated  February , and sent to the ILO direct. The communication was later supplemented by another, dated  February . The complaint was referred to the Government of Brazil, which, in a communication dated  May , submitted its observations on it.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The information available (derived from the complainants' second communication and from the Government's observations) shows that the incident which gave rise to the complaint had nothing to do with freedom of association. The crime committed was one of common murder and had nothing to do with the fact that the victim had been active in the trade union movement.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body decide that the case calls for no further examination.",-1,1970,Brazil
127,".This complaint by the Federation of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of So Paulo (Brazil) was set forth in a communication-sent to the ILO direct-dated  November . In a communication dated  January , the complainants provided additional information. The complaint was duly referred to the Government for its comments, which were received in the form of a communication dated  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.From what both complainants and Government have to say, it seems clear that the action taken against Mr. Pereira had nothing to do with the latter's trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case, and accordingly the case as a whole, calls for no further examination.",-1,1969,Brazil
128,".The complaint of the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers is contained in a communication of  June  addressed direct to the ILO. By a letter of  July  the text of the complaint was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right.to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that on  March  the votes were counted in the election held for the renewal of the Committee of Management, the Supervisory Council and the Council of Representatives of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro. The elections were held on ,  and  March. After the counting of the votes, the complainants continue, one of the two lists that had been presented was declared by the election committee to have won.
.The complainants next state that, accepting the allegations made by those on the defeated list to the effect that there had been irregularities in the elections, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare applied the relevant procedure, which led to the cancelling of the elections and the setting up of a board of management to administer the union and organise new elections within ninety days.
.The complainants, who assert that the elections had been regular, allege that it was on the contrary the cancelling of the ballot and the appointment of the board of management that were characterised by irregularities. They also make detailed allegations that the board of management has acted improperly; thus, its chairman is said to have denounced various workers to the authorities for holding "" subversive and anti-democratic "" opinions and also to have stated that he would not hold elections within six months, since if he were to do so "" the union would fall into anti-democratic hands "".
.The complainants also allege that high-ranking military officers in the service of PETROBRAS had taken steps to have obstacles raised by the Regional Labour Office of Guanabara to the holding of elections in the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro during the following six months, so as to prevent the organisation, in their own words, from "" being placed under the control of subversive elements "".
.It is also alleged that "" the names of nearly  managers at various levels in PETROBRAS, who were not before then members of a trade union, had been hurriedly listed as a result of a decision at a higher level, with a view to their applying for inclusion on the list of members of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro "". Lastly, pressure had been brought to bear on some of the trade unionists returned in the first election to refrain from standing in the new elections, in return for which the management of PETROBRAS would place no further obstacles in the way of holding the elections within the period of ninety days fixed by the decision of the Ministry.
.In its reply of  November , the Government states that the complaining organisation has no legal existence in Brazil and on these grounds refuses the request for observations that has been addressed to it. "" The International Labour Organisation "", it goes on, "" will understand that in this case the supply of explanations would amount to a violation of the principles that govern trade union relations in Brazil. If it recognised this federation as having enough authority to cause information to be requested at the international level, Brazil would be obliged to recognise the legitimacy of its existence at the national level too. By doing this the Brazilian Government would give a concrete demonstration of its contempt for its own laws regulating its conduct. Without implying a lack of respect for the exalted aims of the International Labour Organisation, we are bound to make this statement to protect the sovereignty of Brazil.""
.When it had the case before it at its session in February , the Committee, in view of the reply by the Government, wished, as on previous occasions, to recall that the non-recognition by the public authorities of a trade union organisation was not in itself sufficient reason to deprive the organisation of its right to have recourse before the Committee to the complaint procedure in respect of infringement of freedom of association. As long ago as its First Report, the Committee considered that it would be altogether inconsistent with the purpose for which the procedure for the examination of allegations concerning the infringement of trade union rights had been established for it to admit that the dissolution or non-recognition of an organisation by governmental action extinguished the right of the organisation to invoke the procedure.
.In the present case, it appears from the information available to the Committee that it was after the reporting of the facts (as they were described by the person heading the list that had originally been elected) by the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro to the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers that the Federation lodged a complaint with the ILO. According to a statement in its communication addressed to the Director-General, this was after ascertaining that the accusations were true.
.It seems that the complainant Federation has a factual existence at least. It further appears that the union at the origin of the complaint, which was taken up on its behalf by the Federation, enjoyed some form of recognition, implicitly at any rate, since according to its allegations the elections held within the union gave rise, after the intervention of a third party, to an official act by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in the form of the cancellation of these elections and the setting up of a board of management whose functions included the organising of new elections (see paragraph  above).
.In these circumstances, and in view of the principles recalled in paragraph  above, before the Committee could contemplate examining the substance of the case it considered it necessary to obtain certain additional information from the Government, principally in order to form an opinion on the question whether the complaint before it was received from an organisation competent to submit this complaint.
.The Committee therefore requested the Government to be good enough to indicate both the exact legal status of the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers, specifying the reasons for which, and any laws or regulations under which, this organisation has no legal existence and the exact legal status of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro.
.At the same time the Committee considered that it might have a clearer idea of the situation if it obtained certain information from the complainant Federation.
.It therefore requested the complainant organisation to provide all relevant information on its Constitution and its numerical importance in comparison with the total number of workers in the occupation represented by it and the number of unions affiliated to it, stating in particular whether the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro is one of its affiliates.
.In two letters dated  March  the parties concerned were requested to send the supplementary information referred to above in paragraphs  and .
.The Government replied by a communication dated  April . The complainant organisation, on the other hand, did not respond to the request for information which had been sent to it. However, the Government's communication gave some of the information the Committee had wanted to find out from the complainant, showing in particular that the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro had at one time been affiliated to the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers.""
.In its reply, the Government states that the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers was set up on  June  by seven petroleum unions from different states. The names of these unions are supplied. In addition to these founder unions, says the Government, five others, of which it gives the names and which include the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro, later became affiliated.
.The Government then goes on to give the following information. The organisation of federations by unions is governed by section  of the Labour Code, which lays down that: "" Not fewer than five industrial associations which represent the absolute majority of a group of identical, similar or allied activities or occupations may form a federation. "" The",-1,1968,Brazil
129,"federations shall be set up one per state; however, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare may authorise the creation of inter-state or national federations. The Government next quotes the single paragraph of section  of Ministerial Decree No.  of  August , which says: "" Should state federations wish to set up an inter-state or national federation, they must first obtain permission, as mentioned in this Section.""
.The Government states that the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers began by committing a breach of these regulations, inasmuch as the founder unions failed to ask the Ministry for permission in accordance with the law despite the fact that they were based in different states.
.In spite of this infringement, declares the Government, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare agreed to investigate the Federation's request for recognition, which was handled in accordance with the normal procedure.
."" When the appeal was investigated by the Trade Union Guidance Committee "", states the Government, "" the Committee (a collegiate body in which various government departments are represented, together with employers and workers in equal numbers) was unanimous in rejecting it."" The Government adds that, when the matter was referred to the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, he decided, taking into account the views expressed by the National Department of Labour, to reject the request for recognition lodged by the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers. The decision was dated  February .
."" From then on "", says the Government, "" the so-called National Federation had no vestige of a claim to official existence. While, before this ruling, it might conceivably have had some claim to future recognition, its appeal was finally rejected by the Minister. It follows that this body cannot act as a federation and is not even entitled to call itself one.""
.From the detailed explanations supplied by the Government it would appear that the reason for the decision to refuse recognition to the National Federation of Petroleum Industry Workers was that the founder unions did not conform to the exigencies of the law (see paragraphs  and  above), and that this is ultimately why the aforementioned federation has no official existence in the country concerned.
.Without denying that this may be the case according to current national legislation, the Committee feels obliged to point out that the conditions which this legislation lays down for the organisation of federations, and in particular the condition that founding unions based in different states must first ask permission (which may be refused) from the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, are incompatible with the generally accepted principles of freedom of association, which include the right of trade unions to form such federations as they see fit.
.Moreover, since the union referred to in the complaint, namely the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro, seems to have a perfectly normal legal existence (see below), and since the Government chose to reply concerning the basis of the allegations, the Committee considered it timely to investigate the latter.
.Concerning these allegations, which are analysed in paragraphs  to  above, the Government gives the following information. Elections were held by the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro for the renewal of its administrative and representative organs. There were two rival lists of candidates. After the elections, the losing side complained that many members had been prevented from voting by underhand means, which had affected the outcome of the vote in a sense unfavourable to the losers.
.The Government goes on to state that, recognising that the complainants were well justified in appealing, the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare gave the following ruling:In accordance with the views expressed by the National Department of Labour, and in view of the fact that the voting booths were closed two hours before the advertised time, while the difference in the number of votes cast for the rival lists was less than the number of union members who did not vote, I HEREBY DECREE, in accordance with section  (a) of Ministerial Ordinance No.  of  January  that the validity of the appeal against the outcome of the elections, and of the request that these elections shall be declared null and void, shall be upheld.Hence I authorise the Regional Representative of the Department of Labour in the State of Guanabara to appoint another governing body for the union in question, this governing body to administer the affairs of the union and to organise fresh elections within ninety () days.(Signed) Jarbas Passarinho  April 
.The Government declares that the object of this decision was purely and simply the holding of "" new, authentic and honest elections in which the views of the majority of the members of the union (could) find full expression "".
.The Government says that the legislation governing elections in trade unions empowers the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare to appoint a governing body to run the affairs of the entity concerned, should a vote be pronounced null and void because of some fault or failing on the part of the union's officers, or when, the officers' terms of office having expired, fresh elections cannot be organised under the same management. The Minister, states the Government, accordingly authorised his Regional Representative in the State of Guanabara to run the union in question pending fresh elections, by appointing a governing body. This latter was made up of members of the union concerned, chosen amongst those who seemed most likely successfully to perform the duties provided for in the Ministerial Ordinance cancelling the former elections. The Government draws attention to the fact that the Minister left the union under the management of its own members, and did nothing to delay the holding of fresh elections. It states that although these were not in fact held within the time-limit specified, this was due to internal reasons (dissensions within the union's representative assembly).
.The Government declares that the administrative position of the Union of Workers in the Petroleum (Distilling and Refining) Industry of the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro returned to normal following authentic elections held on ,  and  November  and the newly elected chairman's assumption of office on the th of the same month.
."" The union in question "", concludes the Government, "" is now in full enjoyment of the rights bestowed by the law on bodies representing occupations or classes. The reasons why a provisional governing body had to be appointed no longer apply, and the union is now running normally, its affairs being managed by its own, properly elected members.""
.From the information furnished by the Government it appears that the elections held by the union in question in March  (see paragraph  above) were considered improper, and that the labour authorities annulled them and appointed a provisional governing body to organise fresh elections.
.The Committee has already had occasion to investigate the question of intervention by governmental authorities in trade union elections following irregularities in the way they were conducted which had led the authorities to annul them. On that occasion, the Committee considered that the action taken by the administrative authorities in suspending the results of an election might appear arbitrary even when provisional and temporary and even when followed by judicial action. As in the past, the Committee considers that the principle of freedom of association does not prevent the exercising of control over the internal acts of a trade union when they infringe judicial or statutory rulings; but it also considers it of paramount importance, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, that such control should be exercised by the competent judicial authority.
.In these circumstances, inasmuch as the intervention of the administrative authorities in the present case was in accordance with the regulations relevant to trade union elections, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the government concerned to the considerations mentioned in the previous paragraph and to invite it to re-examine the national legislation and practice in the light of these considerations.",-1,1968,Brazil
130,".This case has already been examined by the Committee at its sessions in November , February , May  and February . On each of these occasions the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. These reports are to be found in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. These four reports were approved by the Governing Body at its rd, th, th and nd Sessions (November , March , May  and March ), respectively.
.When the Committee concluded its last examination of the case, two points still remained outstanding: the placing under government control of a number of petroleum workers' unions in Bahia, and the placing under government control of the Osasco Metalworkers' Union.
.In this connection the Government sent two communications, dated  November  and  February .
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.In all these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that elections have been held in the Union of Workers in the Petroleum Extraction Industry of the State of Bahia and in the Osasco Metalworkers' Union, and to decide, in consequence, that the case as a whole does not call for further examination.
.This case has already been examined by the Committee at its sessions in November , February  and May . On each of these occasions the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. The first appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the second in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and the third in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its rd, th and th Sessions (November , March  and May ) respectively.
.When this case was last examined, two of the original three allegations remained outstanding. One related to the military occupation of premises belonging to the Osasco Metalworkers' Union, the other concerned the military occupation of the premises of the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia and the arrest of officials of that union.
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.Concerning the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the military occupation of the premises of the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia and the arrest of officials of that union:(i) to note that elections have been held in the Union of Workers in the Petroleum Distilling and Refining Industry of Bahia;(ii) to ask the Government to clarify, as a matter of urgency, the situation in respect of the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia and the Union of Workers in the Petroleum Extraction Industry of the State of Bahia;(b) with regard to the allegations of the military occupation of the Osasco Metalworkers' Union, to request the Government to indicate, as a matter of urgency, whether the present administration of the Union consists of persons appointed by the Minister or of persons freely elected by the workers themselves;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again when it is in possession of the additional information specified in subparagraphs (a) (ii) and (b) above.
.This case has already been considered by the Committee at its sessions in November  and February . On each of these occasions the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. The first appears in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and the second in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. These two reports were approved by the Governing Body at its rd and th Sessions (November  and March ).
.When this case was last considered, two of the original three allegations remained outstanding. One related to the military occupation of premises belonging to the Osasco Metalworkers' Union; the other concerned the military occupation of the premises of the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia and the arrest of officials of that union.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the importance that should be attached to the principle that workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes and that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its lawful exercise;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to state, in general terms, what is the present position of the Osasco Metalworkers' Union and the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia and whether new elections have been held in these unions;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again when it is in possession of the additional information specified in the previous paragraph.
.This case was previously examined by the Committee at its session in November , when it presented to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. The Committee's th Report was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (November ).
.The case involved the following three sets of allegations: those concerning the arrest of leaders of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries Workers' Trade Union, Santo Andr; those concerning the military occupation of the premises of the Osasco Metalworkers' Union; and those concerning the military occupation of the premises of the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia and the arrest of officials of that union.
.As the Committee has formulated its definitive conclusions on the first series of allegations, this aspect is not dealt with in the following paragraphs.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As the Government has not yet supplied its observations on the allegations in question, the Committee once more recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the information in question.
.Accordingly the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to state what, in general terms, is the present position of the Osasco Metalworkers' Union and whether new elections have been held in the union;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations relating to the military occupation of the premises of the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia and the arrest of officials of that union;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again when it is in possession of the information specified in the two preceding subparagraphs.
.The original complaint of the Federation of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries of the State of Sao Paulo was contained in a telegram dated  May , followed up by a letter dated  May . The text of the telegram was communicated to the Government on  May , and that of the letter on  June . The Government forwarded its observations on the matter by a communication dated  August .
.In addition the complaining organisation, in conjunction with other Brazilian trade union organisations, made further allegations in a communication dated  July . Lastly, by a communication dated  July , the Union of Petroleum Workers of Bahia made yet further allegations. The texts of these last two communications were transmitted on  July  to the Government, which has not yet forwarded its observations upon them.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, and subject to the reservations made in paragraphs  and , that the allegations relating to the arrest of leaders of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries Workers' Trade Union, Santo Andr, do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations with respect, firstly, to the allegations relating to the military occupation of the premises of the Osasco Metalworkers' Union, and, secondly, to the allegations relating to the military occupation of the premises of the Union of Petroleum",-1,1968,Brazil

132,".On the last occasion when the Committee submitted an interim report on this case to the Governing Body, it had reached its final conclusions on certain allegations concerning restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike which had been submitted by the World Federation of Trade Unions in a communication dated  May .
.As regards the outstanding allegations concerning restrictions on the right to bargain collectively and the right to elect trade union representatives freely, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to provide supplementary information (th Report, paragraph  (b) and (c) (iii)). In a communication dated  October  the Government supplied certain further information on the outstanding aspects of the case.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to bargain collectively, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to request the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to keep the matter under review in its examination of reports supplied periodically under article  of the Constitution of the ILO;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to elect trade union representatives freely, to point out to the Government the fact that any interference by the authorities in the right of workers' organisations freely to elect their representatives, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes would be incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and that Institutional Act No.  of  should not be applied in such a manner as to infringe those principles.
.The Committee has already made nine reports on this case to the Governing Body, all of which have been approved by the latter.
.On the last occasion when the Committee examined the case, at its May  Session, it submitted to the Governing Body, in paragraphs - of its th Report, its final conclusions on three series of allegations which had remained outstanding.
.Nevertheless, in a communication dated  May , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented fresh allegations. The text of this communication was passed on to the Government, which sent its observations on the matter in a communication dated  November .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations now presented by the WFTU are connected with other former allegations already examined in this case in respect of strikes, collective bargaining and the election of trade union leaders. The Committee has already submitted to the Governing Body its conclusions on these previous allegations but the WFTU states that "" the situation in Brazil in the early months of  "" differed from that prevailing at the time when it lodged its complaint in . The WFTU states that there has been a further outbreak of repression against the trade union organisations.
.In various earlier cases the Committee considered that it could not reopen a case which it had already examined in substance and on which it had submitted final recommendations to the Governing Body, except where new evidence was produced and brought to its notice)
.In the present case the Committee is examining the new evidence submitted by the complainants in respect of which the Government has furnished its observations.Allegations concerning Restrictions on the Exercise of the Right to Strike
.In their communication of  May , the complainants state that "" the new wording of the National Security Act "" puts strikes into the category of acts against the security of the State, which means that workers who have recourse to a strike can be accused of an offence which comes under the jurisdiction of a military court.
.In its observations of  November , the Government points out that the right to strike is embodied in article , clause , of the Federal Constitution, with the exception, as provided in article , paragraph , of the ban on strikes in the public services and in essential activities, as defined by law. The Government states that restrictions of this type appear in the legislation of many countries and it goes on to quote the text of various sections of Act No. , of , whereby the above-mentioned Constitutional right is regulated.
.The Government refers to a statement made in  by the Ministry of Labour and to certain provisions of sections  and  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws in respect of the lawful purposes and conditions for the operation of industrial associations. It goes on to add: "" It follows that a Brazilian industrial association may represent occupational or economic interests but never party political, philosophical or religious interests. In consequence the autonomy of an industrial association has to be exercised within the framework of the law, which sets the bounds beyond which an industrial association may not go if it is to keep within its terms of reference and abide by its aims. This means that freedom of association, or any other freedom accorded to groups or citizens, must not be confused with sovereignty or with anarchy, and must not be used as a pretext for infringing the rights of others, whether they be of an individual, of the community or of the Nation itself."" The Government quotes the opinions of various writers on different aspects of relations between industrial associations or trade unions and the State and on the subordination of group and individual interests to the general good.
.In another paragraph of its observations, the Government makes the following statements. As regards national security, the measures adopted by the Government-which alone was competent-were of a general nature and applied to all Brazilians without exception. These were domestic measures which might be taken by any country. Far from impairing individual freedoms, they protect them. As regards industrial associations, Legislative Decree No.  of  March  provides in section  that any person promoting a strike or lockout resulting in the paralysis of public services or essential utilities, with a view to bringing pressure to bear on the authorities of the Republic, shall be liable to a penalty of from two to six years' imprisonment.
.The Committee recalls that amongst the allegations connected with the right to strike which it has already examined in this case, and on which it has previously submitted its conclusions to the Governing Body, were allegations made by the WFTU concerning the threat to workers who went on strike of being summoned before military courts.
.At its February  Session, the Committee pointed out that, according to the Government's statement (in a communication dated  January ), the right to strike of Brazilian workers is guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated by Act No.  of , "" which does not set up any military court to repress strikes or judge those engaging in them "". The Government had stated that offences connected with strikes are judged by ordinary penal courts. At the same session the Committee referred to other statements made by the Government to the effect that military courts form part of the Brazilian judiciary; to the effect that penal sanctions apply only in the event of abuses in the exercise of the right to strike such as exceed the limits of labour-management relations and affect social order; and to the effect that other kinds of strikes may include sabotage, or activities such as may constitute an attack on national security. In conclusion, taking into account the formal denial of the Government and the fact that the complainants spoke only of the "" threats "" to which the said workers were exposed, and not of the actual appearance of the said workers before military courts, the Committee considered that "" sufficient evidence of infringement of trade union rights ... had not been adduced "" and recommended the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case called for no further examination.
.In the new complaint from the WFTU which the Committee is examining, the complainants refer to the provision of a "" newly worded "" National Security Act. The Government confines itself to indicating the penalty which, under the Legislative Decree of , is applicable to any person who promotes a strike which results in the paralysis of public services or essential activities, for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear on the authorities of the Republic.
.The Committee has always applied the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are within its competence in so far as concerns the exercise of trade union rights. It has pointed out in many earlier cases that the right of workers and their organisations",-1,1964,Brazil
133,"to strike as a legitimate means of defending their occupational interests is generally recognised. Nevertheless, in various cases the Committee has declined to examine allegations concerning strikes that were not of an occupational character or which were intended to coerce the government on a political question.
.Assuming that the penalty mentioned by the Government or similar penalties apply or may be applied to any strike declared solely in order to promote or defend the workers' occupational interests, such a situation would be contrary to the generally recognised principle referred to in the preceding paragraph. The Committee can only observe in this respect that this is not proved by the scant evidence contained in the allegations in question or in the text of section  of the Legislative Decree of  referred to by the Government.
.Subject to the considerations expressed in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination on its part.Allegations concerning Restrictions on the Right to Bargain Collectively
.The WFTU alleges that the subordination of the judiciary to the executive as a result of the suspension of the safeguards of judges' independence under Institutional Act No. , has turned the labour courts into bodies for supervising the application of the wage ceilings fixed by the Government. It adds that, contrary to a statement previously made to the Committee on Freedom of Association, referred to in paragraph  of the rd Report, serious restrictions are placed on the right to negotiate in Brazil. The WFTU gives as an example the case of workers in the sugar and textile industries of Sao Paolo (December ) who had obtained a  per cent wage rise, only to have it reduced to  per cent by the Higher Labour Court (TST) because the initial percentage exceeded the ceiling fixed by the Government.
.The Government states that Act No.  is in no way connected with wage policy or labour courts. The policy concerning wage readjustments is defined in Act No.  of , which is designed to keep new wages at the level of average real wages over the past twenty-four months, plus the prescribed increment to offset inflation and an additional sum based on the rise in productivity. The Government has also ordered the review of previous wages adjustments.
.Furthermore the Government states that collective agreements are reached between industrial associations in the economic and occupational categories whenever, under the terms of the law, it is in their mutual interest to establish new conditions of work for the entire category represented. Collective contracts, on the other hand, are signed between the trade union for an occupational category and an undertaking, with a view to establishing new conditions valid only within that undertaking and for a specified period not exceeding two years. Brazil is one of the first States to have embodied in one legislative text the advantages conferred upon workers. This explains the restrictions upon the right to conclude collective agreements, which are used only in very special cases. The Government says, nevertheless, that collective contracts exist in many branches of activity, particularly in commerce.
.The Government states that a reduction may be made in a wage increase only when, under the procedure laid down for labour justice, the court of first instance has awarded, without any justification, a percentage increase higher than the ceiling fixed by the official body responsible for orienting the Government's wage policy. Brazil has had a positive policy in this respect for more than twenty years: not only must a conciliation phase take place before a wage increase is submitted for consideration to the judicial authorities concerned with labour questions, but the increase must be tied to the indices showing the rise in consumer prices (rise in the cost of living) as compiled by a specialised body after a survey. There is nothing to prevent workers and employers, through their representative organisations, from agreeing upon increases in excess of the rate fixed, provided that the agreement is approved by the judicial authorities concerned with labour questions or recognised by the official bodies and that the increases will not lead to a rise in the prices of goods or services.
.The Committee notes that the new allegations, based on concrete examples, made by the WFTU refer to the ceiling imposed on wage increases that may be granted under collective contracts. These allegations, and the Government's observations, reveal that trade unions can and do bargain with employers over wages, and also that the law provides that wage increases may not exceed the ceilings established by the Government; according to the latter this system has been applied in the country for many years. The Government also states that in determining wage adjustments, account is taken of factors such as the cost of living, inflation, productivity increases and the possible impact on prices.
.It should be pointed out, firstly that the restriction thus imposed on collective bargaining and the powers consequently conferred on the government authorities and labour courts appear to apply only to the provisions relating to wages, and that the notions of "" approval by the labour courts "" and "" recognition by official bodies "" do not seem to apply to the other matters covered by the contract. The former text of section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws seemed to establish a requirement equivalent to previous authorisation for a collective contract to come into force in its entirety, since it was required to be approved by the competent authority and since, as pointed out by one writer, the Minister could refuse his approval, thus leaving the contract without legal validity. The same writer points out that this problem was overcome when Legislative Decree No.  of  February  came into force because since then, for the contract to become valid, the parties have had to send a copy to the Ministry of Labour and the instrument has come into force three days after being deposited with the Ministry. The new wording of Title VI of the Consolidation of Labour Laws (section ) embodies this amendment of  and provides that the purpose of depositing contracts is "" for registration and filing "".
.A study of section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws reveals that any provision in a collective agreement or collective contract which directly or indirectly conflicts with any ban or rule forming part of the Government's economic and financial policy, or the wage policy currently in force, shall be null and void and not be capable of enforcement before any public authority or government department; the fact that the provision is null and void shall be declared, either automatically or on application by any party concerned, by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare or by a labour court in proceedings brought before it. Section  provides that the validity of any clause increasing or adjusting wage rates shall, if it implies any increase in the prices or rates controlled by any public authority or government department, be subject to prior consideration by such authority or department and to an explicit statement on its part as regards the possibility of increasing the prices or rates concerned.
.The Committee considers it necessary to recall that, under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Brazil, "" measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements "". In various cases in the past the Committee has emphasised that the right of workers' organisations to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work constitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which might restrict the trade unions' right to seek, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade unions represent, or impede the lawful exercise of this right.
.In the present case it may be understood from the Government's observations that, when justifiable grounds exist, agreements between organisations representing workers and employers respectively may, in certain circumstances, provide for increases in excess of the rates fixed.
.In these circumstances, with a view to continuing its examination of this aspect of the case in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to supply further information on the number of collective contracts that have come into force without changes in the clauses concerning wages, and the number of cases in which the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare or the labour courts have declared such clauses to be null and void, or ordered their amendment, indicating the grounds on which such decisions have been based.Allegations concerning Restrictions on the Right to Elect Trade Union Representatives Freely
.The WFTU refers to its",-1,1964,Brazil
134,"previous allegations, already examined by the Committee, concerning the ideological attestation said to be required of trade union leaders. At that time-states the complainant organisation-the Director-General of the National Labour Department categorically denied such allegations, which prevented the Committee on Freedom of Association from making a more thorough examination of this question. The WFTU repeats that trade unions do not have the right to elect their representatives freely. More specifically, it states that since Ministerial Instruction No.  was issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare on  February , no doubt has remained as to the requirement of an ideological attestation in order to be elected to posts of trade union leadership or even to retain trade union office. The leaders of many organisations, who had been elected and were carrying out their functions, have been deprived by the authorities of their rights and accused of not being fit to guarantee discipline within the trade union organisations in accordance with the social order in force.
.In the introductory part of the Ministerial Instruction quoted by the complainants, it is stated, among other considerations, that Institutional Act No.  of  December  provides for the adoption of measures to ensure order, security, peace and political and social harmony within the country; that trade union organisations play an important part in the pursuit of these objectives since, by their very nature, they co-operate with the authorities; that for this reason and by virtue of their ultimate objective, trade union organisations should have different leaders and representatives from those who, although elected and holding office, do not fulfil the necessary conditions to guarantee internal discipline in accordance with the social order in force and that it is the duty of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to ensure that law and order are maintained so that a satisfactory solution may be found to the problems in the field of trade union activities. The operative part contains a decision to relieve of their functions the regular and substitute members of the bureau, and of the managing and representative bodies of twenty trade unions. In the case of three of these unions (Union of Petroleum Extraction Workers, State of Bahia; the Union of Building and Furnishing Workers of Maring, State of Paran; and the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical, Metalworking and Electrical Engineering Industries of Maring, State of Paran), the Ministerial Instruction does not name the persons relieved of their functions; as regards the other unions, the names of one or more persons are given.
.In its observations, the Government gives a comprehensive explanation, of a general nature, in which it states that there are no restrictions on trade union elections and that the removal from office of trade union leaders or of a union executive by means of government intervention has been provided for by law for more than twenty-five years. The Government adds that this occurs when such leaders, taking advantage of their position, mismanage the union funds or commit acts constituting a threat to the security of the nation or of any group, thus misusing the prerogatives conferred upon them by the Constitution of the country or by the Consolidation of Labour Laws. The Government mentions various provisions of national legislation concerning the exercise of the right to associate, freedom of expression, etc., and restrictions on the exercise thereof. It also quotes a number of judgments pronounced by Brazilian labour courts, stating that these courts "" have repeatedly proclaimed to be Constitutional the provisions of the Consolidation relating to the organisation and functioning of industrial associations, as well as insisting upon the legitimacy of state intervention as practised by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare whenever such associations have disregarded or infringed the provisions of the Constitution or of the law by which they are bound "".
.As regards the Ministerial Instruction of  February , the Government states that the preamble of the Instruction itself gives the reasons for the removal from office of "" an insignificant number "" of trade union leaders; furthermore there was no intervention, but replacement by lawfully appointed substitutes, in view of the fact that it is the duty of the Brazilian authorities to ensure that calm, social peace and order are maintained in industrial associations, so that the problems of the working class can be tackled and settled. The goal of the agitators and subversive elements is exactly the opposite: to prevent these problems from being settled in order to undermine the foundations of social peace in Brazil, so as to discredit the public authorities and create unrest throughout the country.
.According to the Government, the accusation relating to an ideological attestation is unfounded. The provisions of the relevant text of ordinary legislation, Ministerial Instruction No.  of  January , are as follows so far as the requirements to be met by candidates are concerned:Section . An application for the registration of a list of candidates may be made by any of the candidates on the said list; it must be submitted in triplicate to the president in office.Paragraph . The application must be accompanied by the following information and documents with respect to each candidate:(a) full name, parentage, state of origin (in Brazil), marital status and address;(b) social security registration number;(c) name of the establishment or undertaking in which he carries out his occupation or activity, if he is an employee or an employer;(d) documentary evidence as to the length of time he has been carrying on his activity or occupation and information as to the length of time he has been a member of the industrial association in question, calculated in both cases up to the date of the poll;(e) a handwritten statement by each of the persons on the list (the handwriting and the signatures being certified to be theirs) promising to observe faithfully the Federal Constitution and the laws of the country and to respect the duly constituted authorities and comply with their decisions;(f) an attestation that they are of good previous character and entitled to full political rights..The Committee has already examined, in previous stages of this same case, the question of the principle concerning government control of trade union organisations. At its February  Session, after examining certain allegations concerning the control of a number of trade union organisations' and the Government's observations on a return to a normal situation, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, inter alia, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives and to organise their administration and activities. In these circumstances, the Committee does not consider it necessary to re-examine this question of principle.
.The Committee has already examined, in previous stages of this same case, the question of the principle concerning government control of trade union organisations. At its February  Session, after examining certain allegations concerning the control of a number of trade union organisations' and the Government's observations on a return to a normal situation, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, inter alia, to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives and to organise their administration and activities. In these circumstances, the Committee does not consider it necessary to re-examine this question of principle.
.With regard to the allegations concerning the Ministerial Instruction of  February , the Government does not dispute the authenticity of the text supplied by the complain ants and apparently confirms it. It appears, from the Government's observations, that the removal from office of trade union leaders, which affected twenty trade unions, did not involve the procedure of government control referred to previously by the Committee, but, according to the Government, resulted from the duty of the authorities to maintain calm, social peace and order within industrial associations.
.In other previous cases, the Committee has expressed the view that removal from trade union office by an administrative authority is a procedure which might give rise to abuses or to infringement of the generally recognised right of organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities. This principle is embodied in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), which also provides that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Moreover, in connection with the control of the internal acts of a trade union, if such acts infringe legislative provisions or trade union rules, the Committee has considered that "" it is of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority"".
.In the present case the trade union leaders were removed from office not by the decision of members",-1,1964,Brazil
135,"of the trade unions concerned but by the administrative authority and not, it would seem, because of infringement of specific provisions of the trade union rules or of the law, but because the said administrative authorities had considered these trade union leaders unsuitable to maintain "" discipline "" in their unions. Measures of this kind appear obviously incompatible with the principle that trade union organisations have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities.
.Furthermore, as regards the allegations concerning "" ideological attestations "", the Committee recalls that at its February  Session , when examining certain allegations according to which an "" ideological attestation "" was required from candidates for posts as trade union officials, the Committee had before it observations supplied by the Government according to which the requirement of an ideological attestation had been abolished by Brazilian legislation. In these circumstances the Committee considered that there would be no point in pursuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In its observations, the Government now refers to Ministerial Instruction No.  of  January , whose section , clause (e), requires candidates to make a written statement promising to observe faithfully the Constitution and the law, and to respect the constituted authorities and comply with their decisions. Furthermore, under clause (f) of the same section, candidates are required to supply an attestation that they are of good previous character and entitled to full political rights.
.The Committee has always considered that it was not competent to examine allegations of a purely political nature, but it has also considered that it should examine measures of a political nature taken by governments in so far as they may indirectly affect the exercise of trade union rights. In the case of the regulations quoted by the Government, which are expressly applied to the election of trade union leaders, it is evident that a person who has been deprived of his political rights cannot be elected to trade union office. Consequently the Committee considers that it would be desirable to know the reasons for which, in accordance with the legislation of the country, persons may be deprived of their political rights and whether there is any possibility of appeal against measures of this kind.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the importance of the generally recognised principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to draw the attention of the Government also to the fact that when the internal acts of trade unions infringe legislative provisions or trade union rules, it is of the utmost importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority;(c) to request the Government to supply the supplementary information referred to in paragraph  above.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the new allegations made in this case on restrictions of the right to strike, in view of the fact that allegations concerning the right to strike are within the competence of the Committee in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, and subject to the considerations contained in paragraph  above, to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination on its part;(b) as regards the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to bargain collectively, to request the Government to supply further information as to the number of collective contracts that have come into force without any amendment of the clauses concerning wages, and the number of cases where the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare or the labour courts have declared such clauses null and void or ordered their amendment, indicating the grounds on which these decisions have been based;(c) as regards the allegations concerning restrictions on the right to elect trade union representatives freely:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the importance of the generally recognised principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(ii) to draw the Government's attention also to the fact that when the internal acts of trade unions infringe legislative provisions or trade union rules, it is of the utmost importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the reasons for which, under the legislation of the country, persons may be deprived of their political rights (a penalty which prevents such persons from being candidates in trade union elections), and whether there is any possibility of appeal against such measures;(d) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the supplementary information requested from the Government in subparagraphs (b) and (c) (iii) of this paragraph.
.This case has already been the subject of eight interim reports by the Committee, appearing in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. All these reports have been approved by the Governing Body.
.The Committee last considered this matter at its session in February , after which no more than three series of allegations remained outstanding, all the others having been the subject of final conclusions by the Committee. The following paragraphs will be devoted entirely to these three series of allegations. They are allegations concerning restrictions on the right to strike, a ban on trade union elections by the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara, and abuses of which "" controllers "" appointed to supervise union affairs are said to have been guilty.
.In connection with each of these three series of allegations, the Committee and, later, the Governing Body have requested the Government to furnish its observations or further information. The Government was informed of these requests by a letter dated  March  and replied in a communication dated  April .
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, with regard to the case as a whole:(a) to decide, while expressing its concern as to the fact that there are still organisations subject to supervision, that for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above there is no point in further consideration of the alleged ban on elections by the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara;(b) as regards alleged abuses by "" controllers "" appointed to manage trade union affairs:(i) to urge the Government to ensure that the relevant legislation is strictly applied in the event of abuse by persons responsible for the affairs of trade unions subject to supervision;(ii) subject to this reservation, to decide that this aspect of the case calls for no further consideration;(c) as regards the restrictions alleged to have been put on the right to strike, bearing in mind the principle that allegations concerning this right, in so far as they relate to freedom of association, can properly be considered by the Committee:(i) to recall the importance of the principle that unions must be entitled to meet, without let or hindrance, in their own premises, without prior authorisation and free from any official supervision;(ii) to invite the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, to consider amending its legislation with an eye to eliminating that clause in section  of Act No.  of  which makes it possible for the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to be represented in trade union plenary meetings by a delegate entitled to take the floor;(iii) to express the view that section  of Act No.  of , mentioned in paragraph  above, which has the effect of preventing strike action after the tribunal has given its judgment, does not seem to offer the guarantees necessary for it not to limit seriously the possibilities of action of organisations in the defence and promotion of the interests of their members.
.This case has already been the subject of seven interim reports by the Committee, contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and paragraphs  to",-1,1964,Brazil
136," of its th Report. All the foregoing were approved by the Governing Body.
.Following its latest examination of the case in May , the Committee first of all recommended the Governing Body, as it had done on a previous occasion, to ask the Brazilian Government to keep it informed of the situation of the trade union leaders named by the W.F.T.U in its communication of  December  who had not been released. The Committee pointed out that the Government had already given some information about those persons in its communications of  June  and  May .
.The Committee then recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to send its observations on several allegations made by the W.F.T.U in a communication dated  November . These were analysed in detail by the Committee in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.The above two requests for information were transmitted to the Government by letter dated  June . The Government replied in a communication dated  January .
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons set out in paragraphs  to ,  to ,  to ,  to ,  to  and  to  of the present report, that the allegations analysed in those paragraphs do not call for further examination on its part;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the arrest and sentencing of trade union militants, trade union leaders and workers, to go on record deploring the Government's failure to co-operate in elucidation of the facts on this aspect of the case by providing, as requested, evidence in support of its assertion that the reasons for the conviction of the persons in question did not lie in their trade union membership or activity, since that failure makes it impossible for the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body to reach informed conclusions on this aspect of the case;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the "" training "" of trade union leaders, to express the opinion that, while trade union training deserves encouragement, it is for the unions themselves to take charge of such training, which can of course take advantage of any material or moral assistance which the Government may offer to them;(d) as regards the allegations of restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike, since allegations respecting the right to strike lie within the Committee's competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, to ask the Government to be good enough to provide it with information of the character indicated in paragraphs  and  above, as well as any other information which the Government may think fit to provide regarding the allegations analysed in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report;(e) to ask the Government to be good enough to send its observations on the allegation that the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara has been forbidden to hold its elections, and on the allegations of abuses by certain "" controllers "" appointed to supervise trade unions;(f) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report again when it has received the additional information to which reference is made in subparagraphs (d) and (e) above.
.This case has already been the subject of six interim reports by the Committee contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report,  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report,  to  of its th Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its rd Report.
.Following its last examination of this case, the Committee put forward its final conclusions regarding most of the elements in the case. Only one allegation remained in suspense, and the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to be so kind as to keep it informed of the situation of the trade union leaders who had not been freed who were mentioned by name by the World Federation of Trade Unions in its communication of  December  and regarding whom the Governing Body noted that the Government had already supplied certain information in its communications of  June  and  May .
.As approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), the Committee's conclusions were brought to the notice of the Government by a letter dated  November , in particular the request for additional information mentioned in the previous paragraph.
.Since then, in a communication dated  November , received on  December , the World Federation of Trade Unions made a series of new allegations of which some revert to aspects of the case already dealt with by the Committee whereas others represent new factors. The text of these allegations has been transmitted to the Government for its observations in a letter dated  December .
.In its last communication the W.F.T.U first of all recalls that, in April and December , it submitted complaints protesting against the measures taken by the Brazilian Government after the "" military coup d'tat "" of April , quoting allegations regarding imprisonment without judicial warrant of trade union leaders and militants, torture inflicted on victims of repression, the sacking of trade union premises and, in general, the basing of relations between the Government and the workers on terror.
.The W.F.T.U goes on to affirm that the two years which followed the change of rgime merely confirmed the obvious intention of the authorities to do away with even the appearance of trade union freedoms and democratic rights. The complainant contends that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Brazilian Constitution of  and the ordinary laws have become a dead letter.
.The complainant then makes a series of specific allegations which will be examined separately in the paragraphs which follow.
.As the Government has not replied to this request the Committee recommends the Governing Body to repeat it.
.In its communication dated  November  (eighth paragraph of Part I of its complaint) the W.F.T.U lists  trade unionists alleged to have been arrested and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment (see paragraph  above).
.These individuals include Mr. Riani, Mr. Ziller, Mr. Drumond, Mr. Boggione, Mr dos Santos and Mr. Farias Lopes, whose cases have already been examined by the Committee. Other names quoted by the W.F.T.U in its complaint of  November  had been mentioned by it earlier in its communication dated  December .
.Nevertheless, the names of ten convicted persons appear for the first time, viz. Mr. Ireneu Semionato, Mr. Joao Firmino Luzia, Mr. Antonio Chamorro, Mr. Alfonso Delelis, Mr. Jos Araujo Placido, Mr. Arthur Avalone, Mr. Augusto Vicente, Mr. Jos Molinidio, Mr. Luis Firmino Lima and Mr. Manuel Loureno. The Committee would like to have the Government's observations on these cases and, in particular, would like to know the reasons why these individuals were arrested and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. It therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply it with this information.
.The Committee likewise recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on the allegations made by the W.F.T.U to the effect that  miners of Morro Velho, also listed by name (see th paragraph of Part I of the W.F.T.U's communication and paragraph  above), were threatened with trial by military courts for going on strike; that  workers listed by name at the National Motor Factory were being kept in preventive custody pending trial by a military court for going on strike (see th and th paragraphs of Part I of the W.F.T.U's communication and paragraph  above); and that  workers at the Ishikawagi plant, some of them also listed by name, had similarly been threatened with trial by a military court for taking part in a strike (see st paragraph of Part I of the W.F.T.U's communication and paragraph  above).
.As regards the allegations made by the W.F.T.U in Part II of its complaint, the Committee would like to have the Government's observations on the following points: the allegation concerning an ""ideological attestation"" which according to the complainants is required from candidates for election to trade union office (see paragraphs  to  above); the allegation regarding the prohibition on the holding of trade union elections by the Bank Employees' Union of the State of Guanabara (see paragraph  above), the allegation regarding the suspension and threat of dissolution of the Brazilian Dockworkers' Union (see paragraph  above); the allegation regarding the presence of members of the Political Police at trade union meetings (see paragraph  above); and the allegation regarding the abuses committed by some of the "" controllers "" appointed to supervise the trade unions (see paragraph  above).
.The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on the points mentioned",-1,1964,Brazil
137,"in the previous paragraph.
.The Committee would also like to have the Government's observations on the allegations concerning restrictions on the exercise of the right to strike made in Part III of the W.F.T.U's complaint (see paragraphs  to  above) and in particular on the scope of the legislative provisions mentioned by the complainant.
.It therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply the information in question.
.The Committee further recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be goad enough to forward its observations on the allegations to the effect that restrictions have been imposed on the exercise of the right to bargain collectively (see paragraphs  to  above), and to specify the interpretation which the Government considers would be given to the legislative provisions mentioned by the complainant.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on the allegations concerning discriminatory measures taken against dock and railway workers (see paragraphs  to ), and the "" training "" of trade union leaders (see paragraph  above).
.As regards the case as a whole the Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the information referred to in paragraphs  to ; and(b) to postpone its examination of the case until it is in possession of this information.
.This case has already been the subject of five interim reports by the Committee, contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report,  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its th Report.
.The only part of the complaints still unsettled has two aspects: a general aspect dealing with the arrest or sentencing of trade union leaders and a specific aspect dealing with the case of Mr. Riani.
.With regard to the first aspect, two series of allegations have been made: one by the World Federation of Trade Unions to the effect that  trade union leaders had been arrested and the other by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists to the effect that four trade union leaders had been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment (,  and ten years).
.With regard to the allegations of the World Federation of Trade Unions the Committee took note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that, of the  trade union leaders named by W.F.T.U,  had been released without having had any charge brought against them,  were the subject of an inquiry but remained at liberty, nine were abroad, four had fled and three were in custody awaiting trial.
.The Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to take note of the information furnished by the Government and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of further developments regarding the persons concerned and, in particular, to furnish the texts of any judgments handed down and of the reasons adduced therein.
.In the various communications that it has since addressed to the I.L.O, the Government refers to the case of only one of the persons mentioned by W.F.T.U, namely Mr. Ziller, Vice-President of the National Confederation of Bank Employees (C.O.N.T.E.C.) and a member of the Executive Committee of W.F.T.U. The Government states that, since he has fled, he has been sentenced in his absence to  years' imprisonment, and encloses the text of the judgment handed down by the military tribunal of Belo Horizonte, which shows that he has been found guilty of crimes against national security.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the situation of the other trade union leaders named by W.F.T.U in its communication of  December  and not yet released, about whom the Government has already furnished certain information in its communication of  June .
.With regard to the allegations of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists concerning the sentencing of the trade union leaders Antonio Faria Lopez, Fausto Drumond, Jos Boggione and Alberto Josh dos Santos, the Committee took note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that the military tribunal of Belo Horizonte had tried these persons for crimes against national security and sentenced them to various terms of imprisonment. Having also noted, from the Government's information, that the accused had appealed to the Military High Court, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to communicate to it the texts of the judgments of the court of first instance and of the appellate court.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government sent the Office the text of the first-instance judgment on the four trade union leaders referred to in the previous paragraph. Under this judgment Mr. Faria Lopez has been sentenced to  years' imprisonment, Mr. Drumond to  years' imprisonment, Mr. Boggione to  years' imprisonment and Mr dos Santos to ten years' imprisonment, all four for having attempted, with the material and financial aid of a foreign State or a foreign or international organisation, to overthrow the political and social order established by the Constitution.
.In another communication, dated  June , the Government stated that on appeal, the sentences of Mr. Faria Lopez, Mr. Drumond and Mr. Boggione had been reduced to one year by the Military High Court and that, having already served this term, these three persons had been released. Mr. dos Santos had been acquitted by the same tribunal on appeal and had also been released.
.Although the Government has not supplied the text of the appeal judgment referred to above, as it had been requested to do, the Committee considers that since the four trade union leaders involved are now at liberty, there would be no point in its pursuing the examination of this aspect of the case.
.Nevertheless, before recommending the Governing Body to take note of the release of the persons concerned, the Committee observes that one of them has been found innocent by the appeal court and that the other three have had their sentences reduced very considerably.
.In this connection the Committee wishes to recall that, in several earlier cases', it has pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no grounds for sentence can subsequently be proved is liable to impose restrictions on trade union rights. The case of Mr dos Santos provides an illustration of this situation. In the three other cases the reduction to one year of sentences originally set at  years for one of the persons concerned and  for the other two shows very clearly that the charges finally brought against them have no relation to those on which the original sentences were based. When it is realised that the arrest of the four persons concerned goes back to the month of March  and that the appeal judgment was handed down on  June , it is evident that detention prolonged in this way can impose restrictions on trade union rights.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to take note of the release of the trade union leaders mentioned by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists but to point out to the Government that the arrest or detention of trade unionists against whom no grounds for sentence can subsequently be proved or whose detention has in fact lasted longer than the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced is liable to impose restrictions on trade union rights.
.It will be recalled that the particular case of Mr. Riani had two aspects. Firstly, as Mr. Riani was a trade union leader and measures had been taken against him, the Committee and the Governing Body had to determine whether his case involved an infringement of trade union rights. Secondly, a special question arose by reason of the fact that, at the time when the events giving rise to the complaint took place, Mr. Riani was a deputy member of the I.L.O. Governing Body and the measures taken against him prevented him from performing his functions in that capacity.
.As regards the second point, the Committee has already formulated its comments, which have been approved by the Governing Body.
.With regard to the first point, the position was that Mr. Riani had been sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment by the Tribunal of Military Justice of the Fourth Military Region for subversion contrary to public order. The Committee noted at its May  session that the Government had furnished the text of the judgment handed down by the said court, and that Mr. Riani had appealed. The Public Prosecutor had announced that he favoured a partial revision of the judgment and a sentence of ten years' rigorous imprisonment instead of one of  years. The Government had stated that it intended to furnish the text of the appeal judgment. This text was sent by the Government to the",-1,1964,Brazil
138,"I.L.O by a communication dated  September .
.The essential findings of this judgment, handed down on  July  by the Military High Court, are that the crime defined by section  (IV) of Act No. /, for which Mr. Riani had been sentenced in first instance, cannot be considered to have been committed if the accused has not in fact carried out activities clearly and deliberately intended to change the political and social order of the nation; that nevertheless incitement of the masses to direct action with the use of violence, the instigation to paralyse the public services, the preparation of such paralysis, contribution to bringing it about, or orders issued to achieve this end are in themselves offences that must be punished as such; and lastly that the first-instance judgment is accordingly modified, that the legislative basis of the offences committed is corrected and that the sentence on Mr. Riani is reduced from  to seven years' rigorous imprisonment.
.More particularly, the court considered that Mr. Riani, who was both a member of Parliament and a trade union leader, had taken advantage of his position and of a "" period of abnormal conditions due to the system of government introduced by the ex-President "" to publicly advocate direct action and violence with a view to overthrowing the established political and social order, that he had incited the masses to abusive and criminal strike action with a view to paralysing the public utility services, and that he had devoted himself to intense and violent political propaganda in his speeches, at meetings, through trade union circulars and at trade union demonstrations.
.In the view of the court all these actions, although they had been carried out in preparation for the major crime defined in section  (IV) of Act No. / (see paragraph  above), for which Mr. Riani had been sentenced in first instance, could not be held to be a first step in committing this crime and could not, therefore, be punished as such. These actions were, however, offences in themselves, and it was for having committed them and confessed to them that Mr. Riani was sentenced by the court to seven years' imprisonment under section  of the Military Penal Code.
.It seems clear, both from the explanations furnished by the Government and from the texts of judgments in the possession of the Committee, that the grounds for the sentence incurred by Mr. Riani do not lie in his trade union activities in the real sense of the term but rather in political activities exceeding, in the view of the court, the limits of normal trade union activities. The Committee considers that it should not and cannot pronounce on this view reached by the court or on the sentence imposed by the tribunal in accordance with the view it had formed.
.With regard to the procedure followed, the Committee has noted that, according to the explanations furnished by the Government, the Brazilian military courts form an integral part of the judicial system, of which the Military High Court is the oldest organ, and that they offer certain guarantees, such as the right to defence. The Committee nevertheless considers that such a judicial system assumes a special character when its decisions are applied to a civilian.
.Moreover, while it is in any event the duty of the Committee and the Governing Body to seek to ensure that the exercise of trade union rights is not infringed, this duty becomes especially imperative where trade union leaders are involved who are also members or deputy members of the Governing Body and where the measures applied to them have prevented them from performing their functions as such. Although Mr. Riani no longer has that status, he was, nevertheless, when the events giving rise to this case took place, a deputy member of the Governing Body.
.It is for these reasons, having regard to the considerations set forth in the two preceding paragraphs, that the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any change that may occur in the situation of Mr. Riani.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the situation of the trade union leaders named by the World Federation of Trade Unions in its communication of  December  who have not been released and concerning whom the Government has already furnished certain information in its communications dated  June  and  May ;(b) to take note of the release of the trade union leaders mentioned by the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists in its communication dated  October ;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the arrest or detention of trade unionists against whom no grounds for sentence can subsequently be proved or whose detention has in fact lasted longer than the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced is liable to entail restrictions of trade union rights;(d) to note that, following the announcement of the Public Prosecutor that he favoured a reduction of the term of  years' imprisonment imposed in the first instance on Mr. Riani to a term of ten years, the judgment rendered on  July  by the Military High Court of Brazil has reduced the sentence to a term of seven years' imprisonment;(e) to emphasise again the importance of ensuring that, where trade unionists are accused of political offences or common law crimes, they should receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority, attended by all the guarantees of normal judicial procedure;(f) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of any change in the situation of Mr. Riani;(g) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when it has received the additional information requested of the Government.
.This case has been the subject of four interim reports by the Committee, contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its st Report,  to  of its rd Report,  to  of its th Report and  to  of its th Report.
.The reply of the Government forwarding the text of the judgment of the court of first instance having been received by the Office only on  May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of this text until its next meeting and recommends the Governing Body to take note of the information already furnished by the Government, to note that the Government has stated that it will forward the judgment of the appellate court when it has been given, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish also the information indicated in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee, cited in paragraph  above, and to adjourn the examination of the case until the further information requested from the Government has been received.
.This case has been the subject of three interim reports by the Committee, contained respectively in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report, and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.The case raised two series of allegations: one relating to the placing of trade union organisations under control, and the other to measures taken against trade union leaders.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note, with regard to the allegations relating to the placing of trade union organisations under control, that the procedures for elections in the organisations formerly under control have continued since the approval of the th Report of the Committee by the Governing Body and to request the Government to be good enough to continue to keep the Governing Body informed of further developments with regard to this matter;(b) with regard to the particular case of Mr. Riani:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that, by a judgment of the Tribunal for the Fourth Military Region dated  December , Mr. Riani was found guilty of subversion contrary to public order and sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment;(ii) to note the Government's statement that Mr. Riani has appealed against this decision to the Military High Court;(iii) to note the Government's statement that the Brazilian military courts, consisting of the Military High Court and its lower courts, are an integral part of the Brazilian judicial system, of which the Military High Court constitutes the oldest organ, and that Mr. Riani, therefore, was tried by an "" impartial and independent judicial authority "" within the meaning attached to that terminology by the Committee on Freedom of Association;(iv) to observe that the Government has not acceded to the request made to it to furnish detailed information on the case of Mr. Riani and, in particular, the texts of",-1,1964,Brazil
139,"the judgments rendered;(v) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the question as to whether the matter in respect of which sentences have been imposed on trade unionists is to be regarded as a matter relating to a criminal or political offence or a matter relating to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned in such a manner as to prevent the Governing Body from inquiring further into it;(vi) to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the question at issue is not the application of the legislation of a sovereign State but the question whether there has been any violation of internationally accepted principles governing the exercise of trade union rights or of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation;(vii) to reaffirm, in these circumstances, the importance of ensuring that, where trade unionists are accused of political offences or common law crimes, they should receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment by an impartial and independent judicial authority, a principle which represents the application to the questions submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the provisions of articles ,  and  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and which, having been applied by the Committee in respect of all complaints of a nature similar to those before it in the present case, assumes a quite special importance when the person concerned is a member or deputy member of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, by reason especially of article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, which provides that members of the Governing Body shall enjoy "" such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation ""; and to draw the attention of the Government to the importance attached by the Governing Body and the Conference to the discharge of those obligations;(viii) to urge the Government once again to furnish the text of the judgment by which Mr. Riani was sentenced to  years' rigorous imprisonment and of the reasons adduced therein;(ix) to request the Government to inform the Governing Body as to the result of the appeal lodged by Mr. Riani and to furnish the text of the judgment and of the reasons adduced therein and, generally, to keep the Governing Body informed of any further developments in connection with the case of Mr. Riani;(c) to request the Government once again to furnish the texts of the judgments handed down or to be handed down in the cases of the other trade union leaders named by the World Federation of Trade Unions and referred to in paragraphs  and  above, together with the reasons adduced therein;(d) to request the Government to furnish the texts of the judgments given by the courts of first instance and, when they are handed down, of the judgments of the appellate court, together, in both cases, with the reasons adduced therein, in respect of the persons named by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists and referred to in paragraphs  and  above;(e) to take note of the present interim report of the Committee, it being understood that the Committee will report further to the Governing Body when the information indicated in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above has been received.
.This case was first examined by the Committee at its th Session in February , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. The Committee considered the matter again at its th Session, in May , when it submitted a further interim report in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The st and rd Reports of the Committee were approved by the Governing Body at its st (March ) and nd (May-June ) Sessions respectively.
.The case raised two series of allegations: one relating to the placing of trade union organisations under control, and the other to measures taken against trade union leaders.
.With regard to the case as a whole the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the Government's statement that the control of trade union organisations in Brazil has terminated and that elections are now taking place, and to request the Government to be good enough to continue to keep the Governing Body informed of further developments with regard to this matter;(b) with regard to the particular case of Mr. Riani:(i) to draw the attention of the Government of Brazil to the importance of the considerations set forth in paragraph  above;(ii) to request the Government of Brazil to take the necessary measures to ensure that the case is dealt with on its merits within a very short period;(iii) to request the Government to forward to the Governing Body the texts of the habeas corpus judgments already given or to be given and of the judgments to be given on the merits of the case;(iv) to request the Government to forward to the Governing Body, not later than  February , information as to the position reached in the proceedings and as to the situation of Mr. Riani at that time;(c) to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to further developments in the situation with regard to the measures taken against trade union leaders other than Mr. Riani, and to furnish the texts of any judgments handed down and of the reasons adduced therein;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to furnish its observations on the allegations made by the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists in its communication dated  October ;(e) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report to the Governing Body when it has received the information and observations referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above.
.This case was already examined by the Committee at its th Session in February , when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (March ).
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to take note of the information furnished by the Government with regard to the removal of the control exercised over trade union organisations and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed as to developments in this connection.
.The Government makes no reference to the allegations relating to measures taken against trade union leaders in its latest observations. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to reiterate the request which it made in this connection to the Government when it approved the st Report of the Committee and to ask the Government to be good enough to furnish, as early as possible, information concerning the proceedings taken in the case of the detained trade union leaders and to furnish the texts of the judgments; when they have been handed down together with the reasons adduced therein.
.Finally, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information referred to in the two preceding paragraphs.
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in two communications dated  April and  December . The complaint of the Latin American Confederation of Christian Trade Unionists is contained in a communication dated  November . The complaint of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  November . Copies of all these communications, which were addressed directly to the I.L.O, were transmitted to the Government as they were received. The Government furnished its observations in two communications dated respectively  November  and  February .
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations made by the complainants fall under two main heads: persecution of trade union leaders and intervention by the Government in trade union activities.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government declares in the first place that no violation of trade union rights took place on the occasion of the events referred to by the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Government states that "" it was simply a question of measures being taken in order to maintain national safety. In fact, there was visibly in the country an acceleration of a subversive process the consequences of which were easy to foresee. Warned in time, the active forces in the country had to take necessary measures to defend the legal system. This was the significance of the movement of  March , intended essentially to guarantee a democratic rgime in Brazil.""
.In these",-1,1964,Brazil
140,"circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the control of trade union organisations and the statement of the Government that a return to a normal situation is in progress, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the placing of trade union organisations under control may, according to the circumstances, entail a serious danger of restricting the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, to express the hope that the removal of all control of trade union organisations will therefore take place in the near future and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of progress made in this direction;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to measures taken against trade union leaders, to emphasise to the Government the importance it attaches to the accused trade unionists being tried promptly, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the judgments given and of the reasons adduced therefor, and to decide in the meantime to adjourn its examination of this aspect of the case.",-1,1964,Brazil
141,".The complaint by the International Metalworkers' Federation (I.M.F.) is contained in a communication addressed directly to the I.L.O and dated  February . Further information to substantiate it was sent on  May .
.The original complaint and the further information were transmitted to the Government, for its observations, in letters from the Director-General dated  March and  May . As some of the allegations made by the plaintiffs related to the arrest of trade unionists, the Director -General also informed the Government that this case belonged to the category of cases which the Committee and the Governing Body are required to examine with priority.
.The Government communicated its observations to the Office by two letters dated  and  October .
.The Committee was seized of the case at its th Session (Geneva, - November ), but, since the Government's observations had reached it too late to be examined as regards the substance of the case, decided to defer consideration until the present session.
.Brazil has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).
.I.M.F states that the events to which it intends to refer concern (a) members and leaders of the Ja Metal Workers' Association, which the complainant declares is associated with the Sao Paulo State Federation of Metal Workers' Unions, and (b) members and leaders of this latter organisation, which is itself affiliated to the I.M.F. It alleges that the acts in question were infringements of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The complainant organisation then gives a detailed description of the events said to have occurred. It states that since February  the Masiero Industrial Company S.A., having a staff of  metalworkers, all members of the Ja Metal Workers' Association, had been paying wages with ,  and even  days' delay, although the Labour Law stipulates that wages are payable within the first ten working days of each month.
.Having regard to the prejudice caused to the workers by this practice, the complaint goes on, Federation and local union representatives contacted company officials on several occasions, asking that the delayed payments be brought up to date; conciliatory conversations took place from March to October  but yielded no results, while the employer continued to delay payment of wages, ignoring the union's and Federation's requests to regularise the payments.
.The complaint continues to the following effect: by  November  the wages for October were still unpaid; the union, with the Federation's approval, convened a general meeting and, after discussing the facts, decided that if the company again delayed payment of wages a strike should be declared; the employer was informed and took note of this decision; the December wages were paid with only two days' delay; the company was also required by law to pay on  December the bonus for the "" thirteenth month ""; but the company gave promissory notice instead, due in  or  days, which was against the law.
.During the early days of January , the complaint goes on the union and the Federation jointly contacted the employer in an effort to fix a specific day for the payment of wages. Although the employer had promised that no delay should occur in that particular month, wages were received only after  days' delay. In view of this action, the union called a general meeting for  February, and this was attended by Argeu Egydio dos Santos, Vice-President of the Federation. The  members present (all employed by the company) decided that there should be another interview with the employer to ascertain when he intended to effect payment of wages and that the general meeting should convene again the following day,  February, to inform the workers of his reply.
.Immediately after the meeting, Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari (president of the local branch of the union) contacted the employer, who told them that, if the banks discounted the company's drafts, wages would be paid before  February; if not, the workers ""would have to be patient"".
.On  February, as arranged, the workers met again and the employer's answer was transmitted; the workers, angry at his conduct, resolved to strike, considering that this would be the only way of forcing the employer to arrange for wages to be paid in time. The strike was to start at zero hours on  February.
.Shortly after the above meeting, the decision to strike was announced from the local radio station several times during a six-hour period.
.The decision to strike having been taken, several groups of workers formed picket lines and moved towards the factory, where-the complainant states-they met a considerable force of police, civilian and military, under the orders of the Sao Paulo state government. There was no violence during the early hours of the strike, which was peaceful and complete. However, on  February about mid-day, while Messrs. Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari were talking with a group of workers in a street near the factory, they were arrested by the police without explanation and the other workers were ordered to disperse.
.As soon as the state Federation knew of these events, three officials were sent to Ja, accompanied by a lawyer, to take the appropriate steps. The workers, revolted at the police action, decided at a meeting not to reach any agreement with the employer as long as their union officials remained in gaol.
.The workers and their leaders then decided to take legal action in order to free the arrested officials. Through its legal department the Federation introduced a plea of habeas corpus for Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari before the local court at Ja. Twenty-four hours later the district judge studied this plea and rejected it. The complainants state that "" this decision aggravated the situation even further, as the judge had no right, in the absence of a crime, to deny the request of habeas corpus "".
.Having regard to the foregoing, its officials having been in gaol for eight days, the state Federation introduced another plea of habeas corpus, before the state court at Sao Paulo. On  February a judicial panel composed of ten magistrates sat to review the case and unanimously decided to release Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari; it also ordered all criminal proceedings to be discontinued, arguing that the arrests were illegal as the trade union office officials had acted to secure payment of wages which were due, that it was the duty of labour leaders to inform and guide their members, and that such action was no crime whatsoever.
.At the same time, administrative meetings (round table sessions with the Sao Paulo delegation of the Ministry of Labour) were held in an effort to settle the dispute itself. In one of these conversations Dr. Roberto Gusmao, the official representative of the Ministry of Labour, confirmed that the strike was lawful because the workers were fully entitled to claim their due wages. This statement by the Ministry's representative was published in the local Sao Paulo newspaper Ultima Hora and other newspapers.
.After the release of the two imprisoned leaders, which occurred on  February at . p.m., the workers met and unanimously decided to continue the strike until the dispute had been finally settled. Subsequently it was decided to present the workers' case before the labour court in order to obtain a decision at that level.
.On  February, the complainant states, the labour court decided that the delay in paying wages was a breach of contract and that the workers should submit individual claims to the local court at Ja which would then determine their rights and any compensation due to them.
.It was against this background, the complainant concludes, that the breach of contract was collectively attacked before the court at Ja, and that the workers at a general meeting unanimously decided to terminate the strike.
.The Government's reply and  October . In the first of these the Government merely confirms that, having been arrested and kept in custody by the judge at Jab despite the plea of habeas corpus, the two trade unionists mentioned by the complainant were released by order of the state court. In its second communication, referring to the complainant's allusion to a breach of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Government holds the view that, as Convention No.  has not been ratified by Brazil, any complaint thereon is non-receivable.
.This last statement by the Government calls first of all for an observation on the part of the Committee. While recognising that Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Committee considers it appropriate to point out, nevertheless, as it has done in relation to Case No.  (Canada), Case No.  (Sudan), Case No.  (Portugal), Case No.  (Ghana) and other previous cases that the Declaration of Philadelphia is now an integral part of",-1,1963,Brazil
142,"the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation; that the objects set forth therein are included among those which the International Labour Organisation was established to promote, according to article  of the Constitution, as amended at Montreal in ; and that the Declaration:... recognises the solemn obligation of the International Labour Organisation to further among the nations of the world programmes which will achieve... the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining, the co-operation of management and labour in the continuous improvement of productive efficiency, and the collaboration of workers and employers in the preparation and application of social and economic measures.In these circumstances the Committee considers, as it did previously when examining the cases mentioned above, that it should,... in discharging the responsibility to promote these principles which has been entrusted to it, be guided in its task, among other things, by the provisions relating thereto approved by the Conference and embodied in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), .... which afford a standard of comparison when examining particular allegations, more particularly as Members of the Organisation have an obligation under article  () (e) of the Constitution to report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of its law and practice in regard to the matters dealt with in unratified Conventions, showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement or otherwise and stating the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratification of such Conventions.Having regard to the above, and while noting that the Government of Brazil is one of those which have complied with the said obligation (at the request of the Governing Body) as regards the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and recognising that Brazil is not bound by the provisions of that Convention, the Committee considers that its non-ratification is not a sufficient reason to cause the Committee to refrain from examining the substance of allegations based wholly or partly on the provisions of that instrument or principles proceeding from it.
.It appears both from the statements of the complaint and from the Government's observations that the two trade unionists mentioned by I.M.F as having been arrested were subsequently released and that all legal proceedings against them were dropped. In these circumstances the Committee, considering that the complaint had become purposeless, might have recommended the Governing Body to decide not to examine it further.
.Nevertheless, if it be assumed that the complainant's allegations are accurate -and, far from being denied, they are largely corroborated by the Government the union officials Argeu dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari, while engaged on trade union work, were arrested by order of the Ja police, placed in cells intended for criminals and considered as such, they were accused of infringement of the "" right to work "" under section  of the Penal Code ("" coercion by violence or intimidation "") and under section  ("" action with intent to cause a stoppage of work or collective desertion and violence against persons or property ""); and only after eight days' detention in the condition summarised above were all charges against them withdrawn and themselves released, the plea of habeas corpus entered in their favour having been granted on appeal.
.In several previous cases, the Committee has pointed out that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights. In these same cases the Committee has recommended the Governing Body to ask the government to consider whether the authorities concerned had instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.In the present case the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the release of the persons concerned, to draw the attention of the Government to the view expressed in the previous paragraph.
.As regards the dispute itself, the Committee, noting that the labour court considered that there was breach of contract and that the case was brought before the ordinary courts to determine the workers' rights and any compensation due to them, considers that there is no ground for it to pursue further its examination of this aspect of the case.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, while taking note of the release of Messrs. Argeu Egydio dos Santos and Gavino Ferrari, to point out to the Government that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, and to ask the Government to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of such detention for trade union activities.",-1,1963,Brazil
143,".On  August  the World Federation of Trade Unions presented a complaint against the Government of Brazil, and this was transmitted to the I.L.O by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on  August of the same year. The complaint contained allegations relating to entry by the police into the office of trade union publications and the arrest of trade unionists. The allegations were communicated to the Government, which presented its observations on  May .
.At its th Session (May ) the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of the case until its next session (November ), when it submitted an interim report recommending the Governing Body to decide that the allegations regarding entry into the premises did not call for further examination and postponing final consideration of the case pending receipt of additional information on the arrested trade union leaders. The Governing Body approved this report at its rd Session (Geneva, November ).
.The Government was asked for additional information in a letter dated  November . It replied on  February , stating that proceedings were being taken against the persons mentioned in the complaint.
.At its th, th, th and th Sessions the Committee, not having yet received the information expected from the Government as to the result of the said proceedings, decided to postpone consideration of the case until this information should arrive. The Government finally communicated the result of the proceedings in a letter dated  July .
.Having regard to what is stated in paragraph , only the allegation concerning the arrest of trade unionists is examined below.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions stated on  August  that the Rio de Janeiro police authorities had arrested several trade union leaders, including Ramiro Lucchesi, Roberto Morena and Moacyr Ramos Silva. This complaint, addressed to the United Nations, was transmitted to the I.L.O on  August .
.In its reply of  May  the Brazilian Government states that the police had raided the offices of a periodical-devoted in theory to trade union questions-with the object of investigating subversive activities; this operation had been carried out with due regard for the legal provisions in force, and the persons detained received the assistance allowed by law in such cases. On  February  the Government amplified its reply, stating that proceedings were being taken against the persons mentioned in the W.F.T.U complaint, in respect of acts punishable under sections  and  of Law No. ; and that they were provisionally at liberty.
.The relevant sections of Law No.  read as follows:Section . Those crimes are regarded as crimes against the State and the political and social order which are defined in and punishable under ... this Law, namely: ...Section . To reorganise or to attempt to reorganise, in fact or in law, to attempt to put into immediate and effective operation, even under a false name or simulated farm, a political party or association dissolved in accordance with legal provisions, or to cause it to function in the same conditions when it has been legally suspended. Penalty : imprisonment for from two to five years-to be reduced by half in the case of an offence against the second part of this section.The grant of registration to a new party, once approved by judgment, will terminate any proceeding or penalty based on this section.Section . To affiliate with or to aid by services or gifts, openly or secretly but, in any event, unequivocally, any association reconstituted of functioning according to the provisions of the preceding Article. Penalty : imprisonment from one to four years.
.In a letter dated  July  the Brazilian Government transmitted the full text of the judgment in these proceedings. This stated that Ramiro Lucchesi, Roberto Morena, Agostinho Jos de Carbalho, Jos Lelis da Costa and Moacyr Ramos Silva had been charged with carrying on subversive activities in the interests of the Communist movement, organising and fomenting strikes, holding political discussions, steering these into tendentious channels, pursuing disruptive aims, and for these purposes claiming to be leaders of the dissolved Brazilian Confederation of Labour. Allegations relating to the dissolution of that Confederation in  were examined by the Committee in  in Case No.  relating to Brazil I and have not again been raised in the present case, in which the complaint relates only to the arrests of certain trade unionists in .
.In the final part of his judgment the magistrate reached the conclusion that a crime within the meaning of section  of Law No.  could only be held to have been committed if the activities in question constituted a definite reorganisation or attempted reorganisation of a political party or association which had been dissolved by law. This had not been proved during the proceedings, nor had the acts specified and sanctioned in section , which could only follow those mentioned in section . Accordingly, the magistrate dismissed the charge and acquitted the accused.
.In these circumstances the Committee, while emphasising the importance which it has always attached to due process of law, and drawing attention, as it has done in previous cases, to the danger that arrest by the police of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may cause considerable prejudice to the activities and interests of their organisations, and to the importance of the police authorities having instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities, recommends the Governing Body to note that the persons mentioned in the complaint have been acquitted after a previous provisional release, and to decide that for this reason no useful purpose would be served by examining the case further.
.In its communication dated  August  the World Federation of Trade Unions alleges that the police authorities in Rio de Janeiro have arrested Messrs. Ramiro Luchesi, Roberto Moreno, Moacyr Ramos and other trade union leaders. The publishing offices of the Movimento Sindical Mundial and the Gazeta Sindical are alleged to have been attacked by the police.
.In a letter dated  September  the Director-General of the I.L.O informed the complaining organisation of its right to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint, but it has not presented any further information. The complaint was communicated on  September  to the Government of Brazil, which forwarded its observations thereon to the Director-General on  May .ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its communication dated  May  the Government states that the complaint "" originates in a mere police measure ""-a search of the publishing offices of the two periodicals referred to by the complainant, which the Government described as being of a Communist tendency, made by the police when investigating subversive activities. The Government states that Communist propaganda material was found on the premises, that the search was conducted with proper regard for the legal provisions in force and that those detained received the assistance allowed by law in cases of this kind. The periodicals in question are not, according to the Government, declared organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions. In conclusion, the Government declares that the complaint is without foundation and reaffirms its intention to continue to respect individual rights.
.The Government of Brazil ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), on  November . The Convention, accordingly, came into force for Brazil on  November . The Government of Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ).Allegations relating to the Arrest of Trade Union Leaders
.The complainants allege that a number of trade union leaders, including Ramiro Luchesi, Roberto Moreno and Moacyr Ramos, have been arrested. In its reply the Government does not state specifically why the persons in question were arrested but implies that the arrests took place in connection with a police investigation of subversive activities having a political connection, declaring that those detained received "" the assistance allowed by law in cases of this kind "".
.In several earlier cases the Committee has been called upon to give a decision with regard to the application of measures which, although of a political nature and not intended to restrict trade union rights as such, might nevertheless affect the exercise of such rights. In the present case the Committee considers that, as the Government does not deny the statement that the persons arrested are, in fact, trade union leaders, their arrest may, even if that were not the intention, have affected the exercise of trade union rights.
.If, in certain cases, the Committee has concluded that allegations relating to the arrest of trade union militants did not call for further examination, this has been after it has received information from the governments showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the arrests were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. The Committee has, moreover, consistently emphasised the importance which it attaches",-1,1955,Brazil
144,"to the principle that it should be the policy of governments to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.In the present case, noting that the arrests of trade union leaders complained of appear to have been made in connection with an investigation of subversive activities but that the Government has confined itself in its observations to the statement that the persons arrested received "" the assistance allowed by law in cases of this kind "", the Committee considers that, before it formulates its final recommendations to the Governing Body on this aspect of the case, it should, while thanking the Government for the observations already presented, request the Government to furnish further information as early as possible as to the precise nature of the activities which led to the arrests being made, as to whether the persons arrested have been released or brought to trial and, in the latter event, as to the nature and outcome of the judicial proceedings taken against them.Allegations relating to the Search of the Premises of the Movimento Sindical Mundial and the Gazeta Sindical
.It is alleged that the premises of these two publications were "" attacked "" by the police. The Government states that the police, investigating subversive activities, searched the premises in question, in accordance with the law, and found thereon Communist propaganda material. It adds that the two publications are pro-Communist and are not "" declared organs "" of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
.The Committee considers that it is not called upon to examine questions affecting the freedom of the press in general, but that it is concerned only with questions related to the trade union press in particular, in the light of the principle which it has expressed on previous occasions, and especially in Case No.  relating to the United Kingdom-British Guiana, ""that the right to express opinions through newspapers or publications is certainly an essential element in trade union rights "". In that case, however, the Committee expressed the view that trade union organisations, when issuing their publications, should have regard, in the interests of the development of the trade union movement, to the principles enunciated by the International Labour Conference at its th Session "" for the protection and independence of the trade union movement and the safeguarding of its fundamental task of advancing the social and economic well-being of the workers "", and, in view of the fact that the complainant had offered no evidence to show that the circulation of trade union publications of a purely occupational nature had been restricted, recommended the Governing Body to decide that the allegations made on this subject did not call for further examination-a recommendation approved by the Governing Body when it adopted the Committee's th Report.
.In the present case, while the complainant does not specifically state that the two publications involved are trade union publications-although their titles would imply that they are trade union newspapers-the Government states not only that they are not ""declared organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions"" but that they are political in character, in that they are pro-Communist, and that the search made in connection with an investigation into subversive activities revealed the existence on the premises in question of Communist propaganda material.
.Having regard to the fact that the complaining organisation has confined itself to a statement in a telegram simply to the effect that the premises of the publications were searched and has not availed itself of the opportunity afforded to it to furnish further information in substantiation of its complaint, whereas the Government has made specific statements which make it appear improbable that these publications, whether trade union organs or not, confined themselves to occupational matters, and also to the fact that no evidence has been offered to show that the search effected resulted in any prevention of further publication or of circulation being restricted, the Committee considers that no sufficient evidence has been offered to show that the trade union right to issue publications dealing with occupational questions was infringed in this particular case, and, therefore, recommends the Governing Body to decide that these allegations do not call for further examination.
.In all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the present interim report of the Committee with respect to the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders, it being understood that the Committee will report further thereon when it has received the further information requested from the Government ;(b) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the search of the premises of the Movimento Sindical Mundial and the Gazeta Sindical do not call for further examination.",-1,1955,Brazil
145,".In a communication presented on  August , the complainant alleges that in , , telephone girls employed by the Telephone Company (Light and Power Concern) took action in Rio de Janeiro to obtain payment of a minimum wage. The police are alleged to have expelled the telephonists who remained on the premises where the service was carried on with such brutality that one of them went mad,  others being injured and all the employees under  years of age being arrested.ANALYSIS OF THE REPLY
.In its reply dated  January , the Government declares the complaint to be without foundation and adduces, in particular, the following arguments.
.At the beginning of , four employees of the Companhia telefnica brasileira were legally dismissed by the Company. On  April , wishing to protest against the measure taken against them, they entered the staff refectory on the Company's premises, where some  persons were gathered together, and organised a meeting, in the course of which seditious speeches were delivered. The responsible supervisors were unable to restore order and had to call in the police, who sent an official of the Federal Department of Public Security, who was booed and even attacked. At the same time, another employee organised another meeting near the door leading to the Company's premises. As a general disturbance threatened to develop, the public security official called on the police for help. Ten telephonists were detained on charges of disorderly behaviour, committing damage and inciting others to abandon work. Warrants were issued for the arrest of four of them, whose names are given by the Government, while the six others, being minors, were committed to the Juvenile Court. The ten telephonists arrested were immediately admitted to bail.
.The Government states that no person was injured and that no minor was imprisoned.
.On  November , the Brazilian Government ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ), . Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No. ), .
.The complainant alleges, in particular, that on the occasion of a strike called for the purpose of obtaining payment of a minimum wage by the Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company, the police intervened with such violence that several employees were injured and one young girl went mad. All the employees under  years of age are alleged to have been arrested.
.The Government declares that the case in question was not one of a strike but of a disturbance committed on the premises of the Telephone Company by four employees, who entered in order to protest against their dismissal, which had been legally effected. The responsible supervisors were unable to restore order and had to call in the police. Ten telephonists were arrested on charges of disorderly behaviour, committing damage and inciting others to abandon work. These ten persons, including the six minors committed to the Juvenile Court, were immediately admitted to bail. The Government emphasises that no person was injured nor were any minors imprisoned.
.The complaint consists essentially of the allegation that on the occasion of a collective action taken by telephonists in order to obtain payment of a minimum wage, violence was exercised against the strikers by the police and that, for this reason, there was an infringement of the free exercise of trade union rights.
.The Government, on the other hand, denies that there was any strike. According to the Government, disturbances broke out as a result of the intrusion in the Company's premises of four telephonists who had been legally dismissed, and who had consequently ceased to belong to the staff of the undertaking. As the responsible supervisors could not control the disturbance, they asked for the police to intervene to restore order. It is stated that no one was injured as a result of this intervention. The ten persons concerned were arrested on charges which have no direct relation to trade union rights : committing damage, disorderly behaviour, inciting others to abandon work ; they were immediately admitted to bail.
.In view of the explanation given by the Government that the Brazilian authorities intervened solely in order to restore order on the premises of the Telephone Company, the Committee considers that the complainant has not offered sufficient proof to show that any infringement of the free exercise of trade union rights occurred in the case in question and, therefore, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",-1,1953,Brazil
146,".In a first communication, dated  February , addressed to the United Nations, the complainants made the following allegations:(a) By virtue of Decree No.  of May , the Brazilian Confederation of Labour was declared to be illegal, although it represented a majority of the trade unions,(b) Trade union elections were banned in . When it arranged for trade union elections in , the Government, in violation of Constitutional provisions, required candidates to make a sworn declaration as to their "" ideology "", the object being to prevent persons being candidates if they had participated in strikes or had presented demands to claims commissions or had ever been arrested on the ground of their union or political activities.(c) By Decree No.  of , strikes are declared to be anti-social acts and strikers are liable to be prosecuted.(d) During the year , there were certain occurrences in various Brazilian States which constituted specific violations of trade union rights, as, for example, the removal from office of several trade union leaders, the imprisonment of a number of other leaders, the searching of trade union premises, the suspension of the operations of a public employees' association, etc.(e) By virtue of the legislation in force in Brazil (Labour Law of  May ), workers are prohibited from promoting an independent trade union movement ; the existing unions are governmental organisations. The Ministry of Labour exercises control over the drafting of their Constitutions, their internal functioning and their financial administration. In particular, the Ministry collects a trade union tax to support the official unions.
.By a cable dated  March , also addressed to the United Nations, the World Federation of Trade Unions presented a second complaint protesting against a violation of trade union rights alleged to have been committed in connection with an aviation workers' strike.
.The Brazilian Government has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. ) but not the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (No ).Allegation concerning the Dissolution of the Brazilian Confederation of Labour
.The complainants allege that the Brazilian Confederation of Labour was declared illegal although it represented a majority of the trade unions. In its reply dated  December , the Brazilian Government maintains that this Confederation never represented a majority of the trade unions. In its communication dated  May , the Government gives details concerning the circumstances under which the Brazilian Confederation of Labour was dissolved and annexes thereto a copy of a decision of the Federal Supreme Court dated  October  and a copy of the judgment of the ordinary court which, on  January , pronounced the dissolution of that organisation.
.It appears from this documentation that the dissolution procedure passed through two successive phases.
.First, on the same day as that on which the Communist Party was declared illegal and, accordingly, dissolved, the Government, emphasising the close ties between the Party and the Brazilian Confederation of Labour, suspended the latter for a period of six months (Decree No. , D.O. No. ,  May , p. ).
.In taking this step the Government based its action on Legislative Decree No.  of  March  governing the registration of common law associations. In fact, the Brazilian Confederation of Labour never was an approved "" Confederation "" within the meaning of the Labour Law. It had simply been entered as a civil law society in the register of corporations. By virtue of the Legislative Decree of , the Government is authorised to suspend for a period not exceeding six months any association that pursues activities which are unlawful or contrary to the security of the State or to the public and social order. The actual dissolution of such an association, however, is a matter which falls within the competence of the courts, to which an application therefor must be made by the Attorney-General.
.The order for suspension was based essentially on the two following grounds. First, the Confederation was composed of organisations and delegations which were not registered in accordance with the requirements of the Labour Law. Contrary to the legal provisions, the Confederation thus carried out activities in defence of occupational interests which are reserved exclusively to approved trade union organisations. Secondly, in addition to this unlawful activity, the Confederation engaged in political action which is prohibited even in the case of approved trade union organisations.
.Hence, the Government suspended the Brazilian Confederation of Labour for a period of six months. At the same time, it instructed the Attorney-General's Office to make application to the competent court for the dissolution of the organisation.
.In the second phase, the dissolution procedure was initiated by the Attorney-General in the competent ordinary court.
.During these proceedings, the Confederation contested the legality of the suspension measure taken by the Government and, at the same time, demanded that the case should be referred to the Federal Supreme Court with a view to obtaining a "" security guarantee "" declaring the Government's decision to be contrary to the Constitution. By a judgment dated  October  the Supreme Court rejected this application. A majority of the judges considered, in fact, that the suspension measure was perfectly lawful. In their view, the Constitution, while guaranteeing freedom of association, leaves it to the legislature to determine the form under which trade union organisations may be established and function. The Confederation, not having complied with the formalities required by this Law, was therefore not legally constituted and so could not claim the right to be protected against a measure suspending it.
.But a minority of the judges considered that the Constitution authorises no restriction of freedom of association, that the case in question was not one of formal regulation and, consequently, that the guarantee order should be granted to the applicant.
.This point having been settled, the Court, by a decision dated  July , declared the dissolution of the Brazilian Confederation of Labour.
.It appears from the text of the judgment which the Government annexes to its reply that the Court based its decision essentially on the following grounds. First, the Brazilian Confederation of Labour did not obtain the approval required by the Labour Law-a law which has not been abrogated by Article  of the Constitution. Secondly, the Brazilian Confederation of Labour, having as its principal object the propagation of doctrines incompatible with the Constitutional institutions of Brazil and the carrying on of activities of a political nature, did not fulfil the required conditions to enable it to be approved under the provisions of the Labour Law. Thirdly, the Communist Party having been prohibited, the Confederation also became illegal.
.It appears from the explanation given by the Government that the suspension of the Brazilian Confederation of Labour by administrative action constituted only the first step in the judicial dissolution procedure. The Government emphasises that this procedure offers all the guarantees of law to those concerned.
.Considering that it is a generally accepted principle that the suspension or dissolution of an employers' or workers' organisation should be pronounced only by the courts, the Committee, while observing that dissolution was pronounced ultimately by the competent court in the present case, recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, where suspension measures are issued by administrative authority, there may be a danger that they will appear to be arbitrary, even though they are issued only temporarily or for a limited time and as a preliminary to subsequent court action.Allegations concerning Trade Union Elections
.The complainants allege that trade union elections were prohibited in  and that, when they were authorised in , the Government forced the candidates to make a declaration of political loyalty. In its reply dated  December , the Government makes no allusion to the prohibition of trade union elections in  but states that the declaration as to political loyalty prescribed by Article  of the Labour Law has no longer been required since the entry into force of an Order of  April , a copy of which is annexed to its reply.
.It appears from the explanations given by the Government that applying Article  of the Labour Law, the Government, in its "" instructions "" for the  elections, did actually ask the candidates for a trade union executive post for a certificate delivered by the police affirming that they did not profess ideologies incompatible with the institutions or interests of the nation. But the Government adds that, by virtue of the Order of  April , such certificates are no longer required. Henceforth, candidates for elective posts simply have to declare that they are not ineligible for any of the reasons contained in the law.
.It would seem from the details given by the Government that the twofold allegation of the complainants (the prohibition of union elections in  and the obligation to present a certificate of political loyalty) has become purposeless since the coming into force of the Order of  April . Consequently, the Committee feels that it is not called upon to express any view",-1,1951,Brazil
147,"on the question of principle involved in cases in which declarations as to loyalty may be prescribed.Allegation concerning the Right to Strike
.The complainants allege that strikes are considered to be anti-social acts and that all strikers are liable to prosecution before the courts. To this allegation should be added another, dated  March , whereby the complainants protest against the violation of trade union rights on the occasion of an aviation workers' strike.
.In its reply dated  December , the Brazilian Government points out that a strike is not regarded as an anti-social act except in a case in which it is called before the legal means provided for the settlement of labour disputes have been exhausted. In its communication dated  May , the Government refers expressly to this earlier statement in connection with the aviation workers' strike.
.In support of their allegation the complainants make reference to Decree No.  of  March , which therefore requires to be considered.
.Under the regulations in question, collective labour disputes are compulsorily submitted to preliminary conciliation procedure or to the labour court. Collective cessation of work is authorised only within the limits prescribed by the law. It is regarded as a serious misdemeanour if a strike occurs in economic branches designated as "" essential occupations "" by the legislature, that is to say, in public utility services such as water, gas, electricity, hospitals, etc. The definition also includes transport and communications-including therefore air transport-banks, agriculture, schools, etc. The Ministry of Labour may issue Orders to add further occupations to the list. All occupations not classified as essential occupations are deemed to be "" accessory occupations "". In the latter occupations strikes are authorised in principle but become unlawful if the employees cease work "" without proper regard to the conciliation and court procedure prescribed "" by law.
.It appears from the text of the Decree of  March  that not all strikes are deemed to be "" anti-social "" acts. Strikes are illegal if they occur in any of the occupations regarded by the legislature as vital to the national economy. Further, a strike may also become illegal if it is called in a manner which contravenes the provisions concerning the settlement of labour disputes, that is if the prescribed time limits are not observed or if there is failure to comply with decisions of the labour courts (Articles - of the Labour Law). It is in fact to the labour judiciary that Article  of the Constitution entrusts the task of settling individual and collective disputes between employees and employers.
.It should be added that the right to strike is recognised by Article  of the Constitution, with the provision that its exercise shall be regulated by law.
.It appears from this analysis that strikes are prohibited only in occupations which the Government designates as "" essential "", but that, in accessory occupations, strikes are authorised within the limits prescribed by voluntary conciliation and arbitration procedures.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the allegation that "" all strikes are declared to be anti-social acts and legal prosecution is applied to all strikers "" is not well founded, but recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches, in cases in which strikes are prohibited in essential occupations, to ensuring adequate guarantees to safeguard to the full the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending occupational interests.Allegations concerning Certain Specific Cases of Infringement of Freedom of Association
.Finally, the complainants list a number of cases of infringements of freedom of association alleged to have taken place in several regions of the country during the year .
.In its reply dated  December , the Government stated that it had asked the competent regional authorities for information, but in its second communication makes no reference to the results of these enquiries. On the other hand, the Government has supplied the Committee with data concerning the trade union rgime in general and the application of the laws, annexing thereto the texts of important judgments and those of certain authoritative legal opinions. It is made clear that the Government is fully aware of the need to guarantee freedom of association to the workers in all the regions of the country. On many occasions it emphasises that the workers enjoy this freedom fully provided that, in exercising their rights, they observe the requirements of the law. "" In Brazil "", states the Government, "" trade unions are free to engage in any lawful action in defence of the interests of the workers. They enjoy full freedom of action provided that they do not threaten public order or the rights and freedoms of other persons.""
.In view of the general explanations furnished by the Government, the Committee considers that it is not necessary to ask it for further information, but recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the need for ensuring that the principles of freedom of association are applied throughout the whole country by all the authorities and administrations under its control.Allegations relating to the Legislation concerning Trade Unions
.The complainants allege, in the first place, that under the provisions of the legislation concerning trade unions the promotion of the establishment of an independent trade union movement is prohibited, and that, also, existing organisations are under the control of the Government.
.In support of this allegation, the complainants refer to the Legislative Decree of  May  to approve the consolidation of labour laws. In order to examine these two grounds of complaint, it is necessary to make reference to this text.Allegations relating to the Restriction of the Workers' Right to Form Trade Unions.
.Part V of the Legislative Decree of  May , which relates to the rgime governing trade unions, provides for the establishment of two clearly distinct kinds of trade union organisations : () registered industrial associations, and () approved trade unions.
.Registered industrial associations. Under the terms of Article , associations for the purpose of the study, protection and co-ordination of the economic or occupational interests of all persons who are engaged as employees in the same activity or occupation or in similar or allied activities or occupations are lawful.
.Every industrial association is bound to have itself registered. Registration with the competent labour authorities takes place following the filing of a request therefor, accompanied by an authenticated copy of the rules and a statement indicating the number of members, the value of the property of the association and the social services set up and maintained. Registration confers on the industrial association the rights enumerated in the Law : it may represent before the administrative and judicial authorities the individual interests of its members in connection with the activity or occupation carried on by them ; it may co-operate with the State as a technical and advisory body in the investigation and solution of problems relating to the category of persons for whom it has been established ; it may also set up employment exchanges (Article ).
.Approved trade unions. However, registration alone is not enough to enable an industrial association to become a "" trade union "" within the meaning of the Law. It becomes a trade union only when it is approved as such by the competent authorities, and this confers upon it the rights and obligations reserved to trade unions (Articles  and ).
.In order to understand the difference drawn by the legislator between the industrial association which is simply registered and the approved trade union, it is necessary to examine, in the light of the legal provisions, first, the conditions under which an industrial association may be approved as a trade union, and secondly the rights and obligations of approved trade unions.
.The industrial association, in order that it may be approved as a trade union, must have as members at least one-third of the persons constituting the category for which it is established. These categories are defined by the Ministry of Labour on the proposals of an Industrial Association Membership Board, which includes, in addition to representatives of the public services concerned, two workers' and two employers' representatives appointed from lists presented by their respective national Confederations. As an exceptional measure, the Ministry of Labour may approve an association with a lesser membership.
.In order to be approved, the industrial association must be, in the view of the Minister of Labour, the most representative. He bases his view on, among other things, the number of members, the social services set up and maintained and the value of the property of the association. However, not more than one industrial association shall be approved as representative of each economic or occupational category in any given area.
.The Ministry of Labour fixes the area for each industrial association. Associations may be district, municipal, inter-municipal, State or inter-State ; by way of exception, national associations may be recognised.
.An approved trade union must comply with the following provisions:(a) it shall not engage in any propaganda in favour of",-1,1951,Brazil
148,"doctrines incompatible with the institutions and interests of the nation or in favour of candidates for elective offices not connected with the union ;(b) an elective office shall not be held simultaneously with an employment for remuneration paid by the union ;(c) the elective offices shall be honorary ;(d) all activities shall be prohibited which are not included in the objects referred to in the Law (Article ), including activities in favour of any political party ;(e) it shall be prohibited from handing over its premises to any agency of the nature of a political party.
.In addition to the rights accorded to industrial associations mentioned above, the approved trade union has the following prerogatives:(a) to represent before the public authorities the general interests of the category in question ;(b) to enter into collective agreements ;(c) to appoint representatives of the category in question ;(d) to levy contributions on all persons engaged in the economic or occupational category in question.
.It has, on the other hand, the following obligations:(a) to co-operate with the public authorities in the furtherance of social solidarity ;(b) to maintain legal aid services for its members;(c) to promote conciliation in labour disputes ;(d) to promote the establishment of co-operative societies;(e) to set up and maintain elementary and vocational schools.
.It would appear from these provisions that workers have in principle the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation. However, the legislation does not place on the same basis the two kinds of organisation : industrial association and approved trade union. The first is formed freely subject only to registration, which seems to ensue as of right if the legal conditions-of a purely formal kind-are fulfilled. The second is the industrial association officially approved as a trade union by the Government. Whereas an organisation of the first kind is entitled only to defend the individual interests of its members, the approved union is endowed with the power to represent and defend the collective interests of all the workers belonging to the category in respect of which the union is established, whether they are members of the union or not.
.It would seem from the above that no organisation is obliged to obtain approval. It is free to ask for it or to refrain ; if it makes no such request this will not render it illegal ; it will not benefit from the advantages conferred by the Law, but neither will it have to assume the obligations which the Law prescribes.
.Under these circumstances, approval cannot be assimilated to previous authorisation, because it applies to existing, freely established organisations which, in exchange for the advantages thereby conferred, freely submit to the conditions of form and substance which the Law prescribes when approval is obtained.
.It may, however, be asked whether, simply because the approved unions enjoy, to the exclusion of other organisations, privileges of paramount importance in the defence of occupational interests, wage earners are not indirectly obliged to belong to the approved unions. It does happen that the legislature in other countries without any intention of discrimination confers on recognised unions, which are in fact the most representative, certain privileges in connection with the defence of occupational interests which only they are in a position to perform effectively. But the granting of such privileges may not be made subject to conditions of such a nature as to bring into question through their operation the fundamental guarantees of freedom of association.
.It must therefore be considered whether, in the case under review, the conditions attached to the grant of approval do not indirectly bring into question the workers' right to establish and joint organisations of their own choosing.Conditions attached to the Approval of the Trade Union
.The industrial association, in order to be approved, must have as members, as indicated earlier, at least one-third of the workers in the category concerned. In addition to the minimum membership requirement, the social services set up by the organisation and the value of its property are the essential elements which the Government must take into consideration. Finally, the Law expressly provides that the competent authority shall always approve the most representative association.
.It may be added that the Industrial Association Membership Board provided for in Article  of the Law is called upon ""to settle all doubts and disputes relating to industrial association organisation "". The composition of this body would seem to ensure that cases are examined objectively. In fact, under the chairmanship of the Director-General of the Labour Department, the Board comprises the following persons : one representative of the National Institute of Technology, one representative of the Actuarial Service, one representative of the Statistics Service, one representative of the National Department of Industry and Commerce and one representative of the Industrial Associations Organisation and Assistance Division of the National Labour Department appointed by the Minister of Labour, one representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and two employers' representatives and two employees' representatives appointed from lists presented by their respective national Confederations.
.It appears from the foregoing that the decision as to approval is based on a number of objective criteria which would seem to exclude any arbitrary intervention on the part of the authorities.Conditions relating to Trade Union Objects
.Article  of the Law provides that the rules of approved trade union associations must contain a statement that "" the association will act as a body for co-operation with the public authorities and other associations for the furtherance of social solidarity and the subordination of economic and occupational interests to the national interests "".
.Such a provision, of course, is capable of various interpretations. Interpreted in a liberal sense, it may be understood as merely obliging the trade union to respect existing public order. Interpreted restrictively, however, it might imply some degree of subordination of the trade unions to the Government's economic and social policy. This would seem to have been the intention of the authors of the Law as the original text of Article , paragraph (c), provided for the withdrawal of approval where a union did not obey the instructions of the competent "" corporative authorities "" or comply with the guiding principles of economic policy issued by the President of the Republic, or where it prevented the carrying out thereof. However, by a Legislative Decree dated  October, this provision was replaced by a new text according to which approval will be withdrawn where a union "" places obstacles in the way of the carrying out of the economic policy adopted by the Government "". This new provision no longer requires the unions to make their policy comply absolutely with that of the Government as it provides for the withdrawal of approval only if unions directly place obstacles in the way of the carrying out of State economic policy. It may be, therefore, that the legislator, in adopting this formula, intended it to apply only to acts unlawful at common law, as for example acts of sabotage, etc.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the complainants have not proved that this provision is applied in such a way as to infringe the right which employers' and workers' organisations should enjoy to draw up their programmes in full freedom. However, the Committee wishes to emphasise that because it is imprecise such a formula might imply some restriction of the freedom of action of the trade unions in the field of industrial relations, as trade union policy may not exactly correspond with Government policy, although that does not mean that it interferes with public order.Allegations concerning Infringements of Trade Union Autonomy
.In support of the complaint that the functioning of trade unions is controlled by the Ministry of Labour, the complainants make the three following allegations:(a) the Law regulates internal trade union affairs so strictly that they cannot freely draw up their own rules ;(b) trade union problems may be discussed only at union headquarters and with the consent of the Ministry, which has the right to prohibit meetings and, where it authorises them, to intervene with regard to the placing of items on the agenda ;(c) the Ministry of Labour also exercises control over trade union finances and collects an annual tax equal to one day's pay to support the official trade unions.
.A survey will be made of the provisions in the Law relating to these respective points but it may be observed at the outset that all of them apply solely to approved trade unions and not to industrial associations which are simply registered.Provisions relating to Trade Union Rules
.Paragraph  of Article  provides that trade union rules must contain, apart from the statement as to the objects of the union analysed earlier (see paragraph  above), the following particulars:(a) the style and address of the association ;(b) the economic or occupational category which is to be represented;(c).................................................................................................................................................(d) the powers and duties of the executive officers, the method of electing them and the rules for voting, and the grounds on which they may be removed from office or replaced ;(e) the method of",-1,1951,Brazil
149,"accumulating and managing the property of the association and the purpose for which such property is to be used if the association is wound up ;(f) the conditions for the winding up of the association.
.These provisions relate to matters which are generally regulated by all trade union rules, with the sole object, it would appear, of ensuring the normal functioning of the organisation.
.It should be added, however, that by a decision of  August  (Diario Oficial of  August ) the Ministry of Labour published a model set of rules ; but it is perfectly clear from the introductory paragraph of this decision that, yielding to the repeated requests of the parties concerned, the Minister confines himself to recommending the adoption, mutatis mutandis, of the model text. The provisions of this Ministerial Order, therefore, are in no way compulsorily binding.
.The Committee considers therefore that the complainants have furnished sufficient proof in support of the allegation that trade unions cannot draw up their own rules.Provisions concerning Internal Trade Union Organisation
.The complainants allege that the Ministry of Labour exercises strict control over internal trade union affairs ; that it may prohibit meetings and intervene in connection with the placing of items on the agenda. The Law contains no special provisions on this point but Article  contains the following general rule:Persons who are not members of an industrial association shall not take part in any manner whatsoever in the management or services of the association.This prohibition shall not apply to the following persons:(a) delegates of the Ministry of Labour, Industry and Commerce specially appointed by the Minister or his representative.....The Brazilian Government, in its reply, states that no control is exercised over internal trade union affairs.
.The Brazilian Government, in its reply, states that no control is exercised over internal trade union affairs.
.The statement certainly, does not show that the above-mentioned provision in the Law has been repealed, but it would appear that in practice the provision has lapsed. Therefore, in the absence of any details furnished by the complainants, the Committee considers that sufficient proof has not been offered to support the allegation that the Government intervenes in the internal affairs of trade unions to the prejudice of their rights.Provisions concerning Trade Union Finances
.Assets. The complainants allege that the Government exercises control over trade union finances and collects an annual tax to support the official unions.
.Under the Labour Law, trade union assets consist mainly in the following : contributions of the members as fixed by the rules and contributions payable by workers belonging to the economic or occupational category represented by the union "" under the heading of industrial association tax "" (Article ).
.Regulations concerning this industrial association tax form the subject of Chapter III of Part V of the Labour Code. The principal provisions may be summarised as follows.
.The industrial association tax is levied in favour of the approved unions. Associations which are registered but not approved do not benefit from it. It is payable by all workers, whether union members or not. It is paid annually as a single lump sum and, in the case of employees, consists of an amount equal to one day's remuneration (Article  (a)) deducted from their pay by the employer (Article ) and deposited in the Bank of Brazil (Article ).
.The Bank of Brazil must open a special account for each of the approved trade union organisations and forward annually to the National Labour Department an extract from the accounts. Each organisation may withdraw funds by cheques signed by its treasurer and countersigned by its president (Article ).
.A deduction of  per cent for the benefit of the approved federations and Confederations is made annually from the amount collected by way of industrial association tax,  per cent being allotted to the federation and  per cent to the Confederation concerned. A further  per cent is transferred to the ""Industrial Associations Social Fund"" (Articles -), which is administered by a joint committee and utilised for purposes calculated to promote the general interests of the national industrial association system (Articles -).
.The remainder of the industrial association tax must be utilised by the approved trade unions for purposes defined by the Law, such as the maintenance of employment agencies, social assistance, vocational training, etc. Within these limits, the utilisation of the tax is left to the discretion of each trade union, which will always have to consider the particular interests of the category of workers it represents.
.Financial administration. The property and income of industrial associations must not be utilised otherwise than in the manner prescribed by the Law and by the rules. Their securities and real property must not be transferred except with the authorisation of the Minister of Labour (Article ). The annual estimates of receipts and expenditure must be approved by the Minister. The accounts must be approved by the competent organs of the Ministry. A report on the preceding financial year must be furnished each year to the Ministry (Articles -). Contraventions render those guilty thereof liable not only to the administrative or penal sanctions prescribed in this connection by the Labour Law (Article ) but also to special fines, if they relate to the industrial association tax, or to imprisonment, in the event of embezzlement or misappropriation, which are regarded as crimes against the wealth of the nation (Article ).
.It appears from these various provisions that the approved unions not only derive their financial resources from members' contributions but also benefit, as legal representatives of all the workers, by a special tax levied by the State. Although the utilisation of moneys derived from this tax is limited to purposes laid down in the Law, it nevertheless appears that unions remain free to use the revenues accruing from voluntary contributions in accordance with their own rules. However, analysis of the Law reveals that the Government exercises some degree of control not only over a union's utilisation of money derived from the industrial association tax but also over union financial administration as a whole.Provisions concerning Trade Union Federations and Confederations
.By Article  of the Labour Law, the expressions "" federation "" and "" Confederation "" are to be used exclusively by groupings of approved unions ; they are "" industrial organisations of higher rank "". Federations require the approval of the Minister of Labour, and Confederations that of the President of the Republic (Article ). If the President of the Republic considers it advisable in the interests of the organisation of industrial associations, he may order the Constitution of federations or Confederations (Article ). Federations are formed for the different States constituting the Republic. The Minister of Labour, however, may also authorise inter-State or national federations ; by way of exception, regional or municipal organisations are authorised. Confederations are national and industrial. The Law provides for the establishment of seven Confederations in the case both of employers and of workers (Article ). For the rest, the provisions relating to trade unions apply also to federations and Confederations.
.Under Article , approved industrial associations may not affiliate with or maintain relations with international organisations except with the previous consent of the National Congress. It should be remembered that the original version of the Law absolutely prohibited such affiliation. The present text of the provision was promulgated by a Legislative Decree of  July . It is pursuant to this provision that Congress was called upon to authorise the organisations of the second and third degrees to affiliate with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
.It appears from these provisions that the formation of federations and Confederations is the privilege of the approved unions. Like the latter, these bodies themselves require to be approved. Whereas the approval of federations is in the competence of the Minister of Labour, Confederations require the approval of the President of the Republic. Affiliation of trade union organisations with any international organisation is expressly subject to prior authorisation by Congress.
.It would appear, therefore, that the Law has given to the public authorities a considerable degree of control over the establishment of trade union organisations "" of higher rank "".
.It appears from this analysis that the trade union rgime is characterised by the co-existence of two kinds of workers' organisations : industrial associations which are simply registered, and those which are approved as trade unions. It is to the latter that the Law has reserved some of the functions normally performed by every industrial association. The Law has also conferred on them certain privileges, for example that of concluding collective agreements operating as binding regulations, that of representing all the workers belonging to the category for which the association is established, that of benefiting from an industrial association tax levied on all workers whether union members or not, and, finally, that of forming federations and Confederations.
.In its reply, the Government emphasises that these regulations have neither the object nor the consequence of muzzling the trade union movement, but on the contrary of promoting its development. "" Directly aware of the needs",-1,1951,Brazil
150,"of the workers "", the Government "" has not only guaranteed them the freedom to strive in full dignity to defend their interests, but has taken the initiative by defending them in their trade union activities and granting them corresponding rights "". The Government also calls attention to the fact that the trade union movement has considerably developed since the promulgation of the Labour Law "" The trade union movement "", it declares, "" participating in the considerable development resulting from economic progress and the exploitation of the country's wealth, will create within two decades a society in which workers will play an important part......

.There has been occasion to observe in several instances that the trade union legislation which seems originally to have been conceived as a part of a rgime of corporations-a rgime now abandoned-has been the subject in the last few years of important amendments which have rendered appreciably more flexible the previous rigid wording of many provisions.
.Moreover, certain other provisions which still subsist in the Labour Law and which, read literally, might be interpreted as placing restrictions on freedom of association, now seem in practice to have fallen into disuse.
.Finally, the Constitutional guarantee of freedom of association cannot fail to exercise a very great influence on future developments in trade union legislation.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the complainants have not furnished sufficient proof to support the allegation that the legislation in force prevents the development of an independent trade union movement.
.In conclusion, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with satisfaction the Brazilian Government's ratification of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , and to draw the attention of the Government in particular to Articles  and  of that Convention, which prohibit any anti-union discrimination in respect of employment and provide for the full utilisation of machinery for negotiation ;(b) to suggest to the Government that it should examine, in the light of the principles laid down in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, , and with a view to considering the possibility of ratifying that Convention, its existing trade union legislation, especially with regard to:(i) the distinction now drawn between associations which are simply registered and unions which are approved ;(ii) the affiliation of employers' and workers' organisations with international organisations of employers and workers; and(iii) certain other provisions concerning, especially, the objects of trade unions, their financial administration, and trade union federations and Confederations;(c) to decide that, subject to the observations contained in paragraphs ,  and  above, the case as a whole does not call for further examination.",-1,1951,Brazil
