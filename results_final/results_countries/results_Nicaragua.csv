0,".The Committee recalls that this case concerns allegations of refusal by the administrative authority to register a new trade union and dismissals by the public sector employer (the municipal authority) of the workers who formed the union. The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting, when it made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a)	With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals, the Committee requests the complainant to transmit to the Government the most detailed information and evidence possible regarding the alleged dismissals and anti-union motives.(b)	The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the application met the membership requirements at the time of registration and to carry out additional investigations in order to determine whether anti-union dismissals took place and, if so, to impose penalties that constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction, to award adequate compensation and to register the union if the workers still desire. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In a communication of  February , the Government provided the following information in response to recommendation (b) of the Committee. In this communication, the Government emphasizes that the refusal to register was due to the failure to meet the essential requirements as regards the minimum number of members needed to establish or form a trade union organization in the country. The Regulations on Trade Union Associations specifically provide that no fewer than  members are needed for the creation of a trade union, a requirement that was not met in the present case. The Government states that its actions were entirely in accordance with national law and that no fundamental right related to freedom of association was violated. The Government also states that this was demonstrated through the procedures carried out with a view to protecting the right to freedom of association: (i) on  February , the Trade Union Associations Directorate requested the Departmental Labour Inspectorate to carry out an inspection with a view to verifying the legality of the trade union s establishment; (ii) the inspection was carried out on  February  and the Departmental Labour Inspectorate found that there was no violation of freedom of association or of the corresponding trade union immunity; (iii) the appeal to verify the legitimacy of the decision to deny registration was declared receivable, leading to Decision No. - upholding the decision to refuse registration on the grounds of non-compliance with all the formalities and legal requirements; and (iv) the complainants exhausted each and every one of the procedures without success, since each of the stages was completed and resolved in accordance with the law. The Government emphasizes that it has been and will continue to be a guarantor of freedom of association and states that there have been no anti-union dismissals and that at the time of the application for registration of the trade union the requirements of the law were not met.
.Furthermore, since the last examination of the case and to date, the Committee has not received any information from the complainant organization, the Confederation of Trade Union Action and Unity (CAUS).
.In these circumstances, and taking due note of the information provided by the Government, the Committee considers this case closed and will not pursue its examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of  November  from the Confederation of Trade Union Action and Unity (CAUS).
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the complainant organization denounces the administrative authority s refusal to register a new trade union and alleges anti-union discrimination (pressure and dismissals) by the municipal authority of El Crucero against the workers who formed the union.
.The complainant organization describes the sequence of events which gave rise to the complaint, as follows: (i) on  November , a group of workers employed by the El Crucero municipal authority agreed to convene a general assembly in order to create a new trade union for the municipal employees; (ii) on  December , the general assembly was held; having verified that  active employees of the municipality (whose names are provided by the complainant) were present and that the requirements of Nicaraguan labour law were met, the employees formed the El Crucero Municipal Workers' Union, adopted its constitution and subsequently elected its executive committee; (iii) on  December , they submitted an application for registration of the union to the Trade Union Associations Directorate at the Ministry of Labour, in order for the union to be included in the official register, acquire legal personality and have its executive committee approved; all the legally required documentation, including the list of workers with their names and signatures, was appended to the application; (iv) since the ten-day period for registration established by article  of the Labour Code had elapsed without any response from the authority, on  February  five of the elected trade union officers applied in writing to the director of the Trade Union Associations Directorate for the union to be registered; and (v) through Decision No. - the Trade Union Associations Directorate rejected the union s application for registration, on the grounds that a special inspection by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate on  February  had established that five of the founding members, who were also on the executive committee, were not active employees of the municipality.
.The complainant organization alleges that the Trade Union Associations Directorate: (i) failed to fulfil its duty to register the union within the legally established period of ten days from the submission of the application, only responding  days later; (ii) despite the fact that it lacked the legal authority to do so, that this was not a requirement for union registration and that nobody had requested it, it called for a special investigation, even though none of the three grounds for refusing registration established by article  of the Labour Code was applicable to the union (objectives or aims not in conformity with the Labour Code, fewer than  members, or proven falsification of signatures or non-existence of individuals listed as members); and (iii) colluded with the municipal authority in failing to register the trade union in time and thereby leaving the workers unprotected; in the two months following the trade union s establishment, the municipal authority pressurized and penalized the workers, issuing letters of dismissal to most of the executive committee members.
.In its communication of  February , the Government affirms that its actions conformed entirely to national law and that no fundamental right related to freedom of association was violated. The Government indicates that this is demonstrated by the events which occurred and the actions and decisions of the competent authorities: (i) on  December , the Trade Union Associations Directorate received, from an officer of the complainant organization, an application for registration of the El Crucero Municipal Workers' Union; (ii) on  December , a group of workers of the aforementioned municipality appeared, requesting proof that the union was in the process of being registered and denouncing the fact that various people elected to positions of leadership had lost their jobs; (iii) on  February , the Ministry of Labour received a complaint from members of the trade union that was being registered objecting to the supposed violation of trade union immunity and the dismissal of workers proposed as members of its executive committee; (iv) on  February , as a result of the complaint received on  December  the Trade Union Associations Directorate requested the Departmental Labour Inspectorate to conduct an inspection at the El Crucero municipal offices in order to ascertain whether the individuals who had attended the constituent assembly of the union were active workers; (v) on  February , the Departmental Labour Inspectorate conducted an inspection at the aforementioned municipal offices to investigate the allegations, including the supposed violation of trade union immunity, and established that only two of the eight workers who claimed to comprise the executive committee were in fact actively employed, and that the other six had resigned from their posts, unbidden and of their own free will; it therefore declared the complaint alleging violation of trade union immunity to be unfounded (Departmental Labour Inspectorate Decision No. - also shows that the inspection of the payroll documents for the first two weeks of February  revealed that  of the  workers listed by the complainant organization as present at the union s constituent assembly were not actively employed); (vi) on  February , as a result of the inspection, the Trade Union Associations Directorate issued Decision No. - rejecting the union s application for registration on the grounds that the applicants were not active municipal employees; the application thus failed to comply with one of the fundamental legal requirements (article  of the Labour Code requires that there be",1,2015,Nicaragua
1,"no fewer than  members for the creation of a trade union); (vii) on  February , the Trade Union Associations Directorate received an appeal against Decision No. -; it referred the appeal to the Labour Inspectorate-General, which in turn issued Decision No. - declaring the appeal to be unfounded and upholding Decision No. -; (viii) on  May , one of the members of the executive committee of the union which had applied for registration (Ms Alejandra Urtecho Melndez) lodged an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) against Decision No. - and, on  October , the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice issued Ruling No. , which dismissed the appeal for amparo, finding that it did not substantiate the alleged violations of the applicant s labour rights and that the applicant did not provide evidence to rebut the findings of the labour inspection, which had established that a number of the members present at the union s constituent assembly were not active employees of the municipality concerned. The ruling of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, a copy of which is provided by the Government, also indicates that the appellant: (a) did not attach evidence to her appeal for amparo that each of those present at the union s constituent assembly was actively employed; and (b) was not entitled to trade union immunity because the union had not previously been registered, and dismissing members of the executive committee of a trade union which had not been duly registered was in conformity with the Labour Code and the Municipal Administrative Careers Act.
.Lastly, the Government highlights the progress made in terms of freedom of association in the country, referring to the large increase in registrations of trade unions (with , new trade union organizations registered in the '  period), and the recognition of public sector trade unions and unions formed by own-account workers.
.The Committee notes that the complainant objects to the administrative authority s refusal to register a new trade union and alleges anti-union discrimination by the public employer (El Crucero municipality) in the form of dismissals of the workers who formed the trade union.
.As regards the refusal to register the trade union, the Committee observes that an inspection carried out by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate, in response to a complaint that members of the union s executive committee were not active workers, established that  of the  workers listed by the complainant as participants in the union s constituent assembly were not active workers. The Committee observes that, in view of this information, the Trade Union Associations Directorate refused to register the trade union on the grounds that it failed to meet the requirement of  workers established by article  of the Labour Code. The Committee recalls, in this connection, that the legal requirement that there be a minimum number of  members to form a union does not seem excessive and, therefore, does not in itself constitute an obstacle to the formation of a trade union [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. However, the Committee notes with regret the delay in the processing of the union s application for registration, which was received on  December  and was not decided upon until  February  ( days later ' even though article  of the Labour Code imposes a ten-day deadline). The Committee notes that Departmental Labour Inspectorate Decision No. -, which was appended by the Government, indicates that failure to meet the minimum membership requirement (by one single worker) was established on the basis of payroll information listing the number of active workers in February , two months after the application for registration was made, and that after the submission of this application a complaint was made concerning dismissals in violation of trade union immunity. The Committee cannot rule out the possibility that the delay in proceedings may have had a negative impact on the union s ability to fulfil the membership requirement and consequently become registered and obtain trade union immunity for its executive committee. It requests the Government to carry out an additional investigation in this regard, to indicate whether the application met the membership requirements for registration at the time of filing, and to the extent that anti-union dismissals are found to have occurred, to register the union if the workers still desire. Finally, the Committee wishes to recall that a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.As regards the allegation of anti-union pressure and dismissals, the Committee observes that, if proven, the dismissals would have created an obstacle to the union s registration (which was refused on the grounds that the union was one worker short). In this respect, the Committee regrets that the complainant organization did not provide more detailed information to substantiate its allegation, such as the dismissal letters to which it refers or the names of those affected. On the one hand, the Committee notes the Government s indication that it received a complaint alleging violation of trade union immunity, but that the complaint was dismissed after the Departmental Labour Inspectorate established that the six members of the executive committee who were no longer actively employed had resigned from their posts voluntarily. On the other hand, the Committee observes that the ruling of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, appended by the Government, refers to dismissals and indicates that trade union immunity did not apply because the union had not previously been registered and that the dismissal of members of the executive committee of a trade union which had not been duly registered was in accordance with the law (the ruling does not consider whether anti-union motives were involved and merely states that the protection afforded by trade union immunity was not applicable). The Committee expresses its concern at the fact that the allegation of anti-union discrimination was not examined in greater depth, particularly since, if it had been proven, it would have affected not only the workers concerned but also the efforts to establish a trade union within the municipal authority. The Committee recalls that where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved, the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In view of the divergent nature of the information supplied concerning the allegation of anti-union dismissals, including inconsistency between the administrative and legal decisions communicated by the Government, and also the lack of specific details that would enable examination of the allegation, the Committee requests the complainant to provide the Government with the most detailed information and evidence possible regarding the alleged dismissals and anti-union motives. The Committee also requests the Government to carry out any additional investigation to determine whether anti-union dismissals took place and, if so, to impose penalties that constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction and to award adequate compensation. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the allegations of anti-union dismissals, the Committee requests the complainant to transmit to the Government the most detailed information and evidence possible regarding the alleged dismissals and anti-union motives.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the application met the membership requirements at the time of registration and to carry out additional investigations in order to determine whether anti-union dismissals took place and, if so, to impose penalties that constitute a sufficiently dissuasive sanction, to award adequate compensation and to register the union if the workers still desire. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",1,2015,Nicaragua
2,".The Committee recalls that this case, submitted in December  and last examined in October , concerns the transfer and subsequent dismissal of three trade union officials by the Ministry of Education on the pretext of restructuring. In its th Report, of October , the Committee took note of the reinstatement of the trade union official Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez and requested the Government to keep it informed of any final decisions handed down concerning the industrial actions brought by the trade union officials Mr William Jos Morales Peralta and Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez. The Committee requested the complainant organization, the Administrative Workers' and Teachers' Union of the Ministry of Education (SINTRADOC) to provide information on the status of the appeal submitted to the labour courts for the failure to pay Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez s th salary.
.In its communications of  December ,  December ,  February and  August ,  March and  October ,  March  and  March and  September , SINTRADOC states that: (i) the appeal for the failure to pay Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez s th salary is still pending; and (ii) although the reinstatement of Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez was ordered in a decision dated  April , the State filed an appeal and, by a decision dated  April , the National Labour Appeals Tribunal overturned the decision of the first instance and rejected the claim for reinstatement and for the payment of outstanding wages. The complainant organization states that the official filed an application for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) with the Supreme Court of Justice, but that this application was denied. The complainant organization requests the Committee to find in favour of Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez awarding him an amount in Nicaraguan crdobas or its equivalent in dollars for the damages caused to him by the State for having dismissed him arbitrarily and unilaterally, in violation of his trade union rights. The complainant organization also states that, despite having made a request to update the certification of the new executive committee on  July , and despite having taken the necessary steps, the Directorate of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour had not granted the requested certification.
.In its communications of  January and  May ,  October ,  May  and  September , the Government states the following:' Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez was reinstated to his post on  February . On  November , the National Labour Appeals Tribunal, which is the highest labour court, handed down a final decision rejecting the appeal filed by the trade union official in relation to the non-payment of the th salary.' With regard to Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez, the Government states that there was no infringement of any labour or trade union rights, since, as the associated documents show, the Ministry of Education requested the Ministry of Labour to authorize the cancellation of the individual contract for just cause in view of a failure to comply with labour obligations in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Labour authorized the cancellation of the individual contract by Resolution No. / and the Ministry of Education gave notice of the cancellation of the contract as from  August . Exercising his rights, the official filed a claim for reinstatement, and the Ministry of Education filed an appeal against the corresponding decision to the National Labour Tribunal. By means of Final Decision No. /, dated  April , the National Labour Appeals Tribunal rejected the claim for reinstatement and for the payment of outstanding wages, but upheld his right to be paid social benefits such as holidays and the th salary; furthermore, the operative part of the decision, which has the status of res judicata, clearly states, in addition to rejecting Mr Jimnez Hernndez s claim, that the payment of costs is not required. Consequently, there are no grounds whatsoever for his request for a financial award in Nicaraguan crdobas or the equivalent in dollars. The Government also states that Mr Jimnez Hernndez filed an application for amparo with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice but that this application was not granted. The Government emphasizes that Mr Jimnez Hernndez s claim has no legal basis whatsoever.' In relation to Mr William Jos Morales Peralta, the Government states that, on  October , the Sixth District Labour Court of Managua closed the proceedings relating to the claim for reinstatement and for the payment of outstanding wages. On  November , the judicial authority had requested the complainant to provide a contact address in the city of Managua and, as he failed to do so, the judicial authority closed the proceedings in October .' Regarding the application for the certification of SINTRADOC s executive committee in , the Government states that it was on the grounds that the union failed to comply with the legal requirements, in terms of the documentation submitted to the Directorate of Trade Union Associations with the aim of updating its executive committee, that certification was not granted (the Government has attached documentation on the requirements that were not met, such as inconsistency in the dates indicated by the union).
.The Committee recalls that the transfer and subsequent dismissal of the three trade union officials took place more than a decade ago and notes that, according to the associated documentation sent by the complainant organization and by the Government, the issues pending since the last examination of the case have now been resolved.
.With regard to the appeal that was filed by Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez (reinstated in ) for the non-payment of the th salary, the Committee notes that, as reported by the Government, on  November , the National Labour Appeals Tribunal rejected the appeal.
.With regard to Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez, the Committee notes that, as reported by the Government and the complainant organization, on  April , the National Labour Appeals Tribunal overturned the decision of the first instance ordering reinstatement and the payment of outstanding wages. The Government has attached copies of the decisions of the first and second instance. The Committee notes that, in the first instance, the court considered that the trade union official held the position of national supervisor of education and that, accordingly, the Teaching Careers Act should be applied, and therefore the process of cancelling the contract should be handled by the National Teaching Committee and not the Ministry of Labour as happened in this case. In the second instance, the tribunal held that it was sufficient only to comply with the requirements of the Labour Code (in other words, for the dismissal to be based on just cause attributable to the official and to have the prior authorization of the Ministry of Labour) without taking into account the special procedure under the Teaching Careers Act. The Committee notes that the tribunal did not order the payment of costs and that the application for amparo before the Supreme Court of Justice was denied. The Committee further notes that it does not appear from the above-mentioned documents that the transfer and subsequent dismissal of the official were on anti-union grounds or that there was an infringement of labour law.
.With regard to Mr William Jos Morales Peralta, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, in  the proceedings relating to the claim for reinstatement and for the payment of outstanding wages were closed.
.In the light of the foregoing, and taking due note of the extensive documentation provided both by the complainant organization and by the Government subsequent to the last examination of the case, and of the fact that when it first examined this case, the Committee considered that it had insufficient information to conclude that the transfer and subsequent dismissal of the three officials were on anti-union grounds, the Committee considers that this case is closed and will not pursue its examination of it.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Governments and/or complainants concerned to keep it informed of any developments relating to the following cases.Case No.Last examination on the meritsLast follow-up examination (Pakistan)March October  (Algeria)March June  (Argentina)November November  (Democratic Republic of the Congo)November June  (Philippines)October October  (France)March '  (Democratic Republic of the Congo)March '  (Islamic Republic of Iran)March June  (Guatemala)March October  (El Salvador)June June  (Pakistan)March October  (Democratic Republic of the Congo)March March  (Canada)March '  (Turkey)June November  (Morocco)March March  (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela)November '  (Argentina)November '  (El Salvador)June '  (Argentina)March '  (Liberia)October October  (Turkey)June November  (India)March '  (Algeria)March June  (Canada)March '  (Cambodia)October October  (Cameroon)June October  (El Salvador)November '  (Thailand)March March  (Romania)November '  (Liberia)March '  (Cameroon)October October  (Costa Rica)October '  (Argentina)October '  (Costa Rica)March June  (Argentina)October '  (Plurinational State of Bolivia)March '  (Plurinational State of Bolivia)March '  (Pakistan)June October ",1,2011,Nicaragua

.In its November  report (GB./INS/), the Committee informed the Governing Body that, from that moment onwards, any cases in which it was examining the follow up given to its recommendations, for which no information has been received either from the Government or from the complainant for  months (or  months from the last examination of the case) would be considered closed. At its current session, the Committee applied this rule to the following case:  (Costa Rica).
.The Committee last examined this case at its June  meeting and on that occasion it made the following recommendation [see th Report, para. ]:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any rulings handed down with respect to the transfer and subsequent dismissal of trade union officials Mr William Jos Morales Peralta, Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez and Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez.
.In its communications of September , March  and December , the Administrative Workers' and Teachers' Union of the Ministry of Education (SINTRADOC) enclosed a copy of the decision of the National Labour Appeals Tribunal (a court of second instance) ordering the reinstatement of the trade union official Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez and payment of outstanding wages. SINTRADOC states that while his reinstatement took place on  February , proceedings before the labour courts for failure to pay the th salary owed to him in accordance with labour law are pending. SINTRADOC also emphasizes that the first-instance rulings concerning the actions brought by the trade union officials Mr William Jos Morales Peralta and Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez are currently pending.
.In its communication of  October , the Government indicates that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the appeal for amparo (for violation of constitutional rights) submitted by Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez and Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez against the dismissal decision issued by the administrative authority. The Government states, however, that, in conformity with the ruling of the National Labour Appeals Tribunal, on  February  Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez was reinstated. The Government also encloses proof of payment of lost wages. Lastly, the Government requests that the SINTRADOC communications signed by Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez be dismissed as he is not registered as the Secretary-General of SINTRADOC.
.The Committee takes note of this information, in particular with regard to the reinstatement of trade union official Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez and requests the Government to keep it informed of any final rulings handed down concerning the industrial actions brought by the trade union officials Mr William Jos Morales Peralta and Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez. The Committee requests the complainant to provide information on the status of the appeal submitted to the labour courts for failure to pay Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez s th salary. Highlighting that the complaints were submitted on  December , the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied and firmly expects the judicial authority to issue a ruling soon regarding the outstanding issues mentioned.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the Administrative Workers' and Teachers' Union of the Ministry of Education (SINTRADOC) dated  December .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  April and  June .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  December , SINTRADOC alleges the transfer and subsequent dismissal of Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez, General Secretary, Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez, Organization and Information Secretary, and Mr William Jos Morales Peralta, Labour and Disputes Secretary, which it ascribes to retaliation for their trade union activities in defence of workers' rights (the complainant organization sends documentation relating to their union activities and claims).
.SINTRADOC alleges that, in August , the authorities of the Ministry of Education arbitrarily and unilaterally informed seven workers, and the three abovementioned union officials who worked at the Directorate-General of Education, that as a result of reorganization, they would be transferred, leaving the posts of national supervisors of education at the Ministry headquarters to take up posts as classroom teachers, in other words, changing their general conditions of employment which SINTRADOC considers to violate the trade union immunity established in the legislation and in the collective agreement.
.Further to the presentation in August  of complaints by the three union officials against the transfer, the labour inspectorate issued decisions in their favour. Previously, the three officials had filed a lawsuit with the Appeals Court, which provisionally suspended the transfer decision and ruled that the matter should be referred to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The complainant indicates that, on  April , the aforementioned Chamber rejected the officials' claims, whereupon the latter brought an action to overturn that ruling on the grounds that it was without any legal foundation. In September , the Ministry submitted to the administrative authority of the Ministry of Labour, through oral administrative proceedings, the cancellation of the employment contracts of the three officials on the grounds of dereliction of duty. In the same proceedings, the cancellation of the employment contracts was authorized.
.SINTRADOC adds that, in view of this situation, and further to the adverse outcome of their appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights), the three union officials decided to bring an action against illegal dismissal through the ordinary labour court, requesting reinstatement and the payment of outstanding salaries.
.In its communications dated  April and  June , the Government categorically denies that there were any anti-union grounds in the decision to transfer the three officials of the complainant trade union. On the contrary, it indicates that it maintains harmonious and respectful relations with the many trade union organizations in the teaching sector, as borne out by the fact that the current collective agreement, which is renewed every two years, has been signed by  trade unions. The Government adds that the decision to transfer the three trade union officials was taken in the context of restructuring the public education system, which entailed the abolition of the unit in which the officials and other workers were employed. The Government emphasizes that, in view of the fact that the posts occupied by the three officials were due to disappear, the Ministry of Education could have dismissed them directly under the legislation in force, but opted to maintain their employment and their salaries, taking account of operational reasons such as the urgent need to fill teaching posts at schools in the city of Managua. Since the three officials refused the transfer decided upon in August , after the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice had declared on  April  that there had been no violation of constitutional rights (as the transfers were conducted within the law) and that the obligation was on the interested parties to accept the transfer in response to the needs of the education system, the labour inspector, at the request of the Ministry of Education, authorized the cancellation of the contracts of the three officials, in August , on grounds of gross misconduct (failure to",0,2011,Nicaragua
4,"perform their duties) and the fact that the Teaching Careers Act authorizes transfers further to an order from the Ministry of Education. The Government confirms that the officials, Mr William Jos Morales Peralta and Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez, submitted a claim for reinstatement to the ordinary labour court, and that the Civil Service Appeals Board rejected the appeal lodged by Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez against his dismissal. An appeal for amparo was submitted by Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez and Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez against the dismissal decision issued by the administrative authority further to the ruling (against the three officials) issued by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, and is currently pending. Lastly, the Government emphasizes that, in the present case, the interested parties have had recourse to numerous administrative and judicial remedies provided for in the legislation with a view to defending their rights.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant trade union alleges the illegal transfer of three trade union officials by decision of the Ministry of Education (a transfer not accepted by the officials concerned) in August  and their subsequent dismissal, in September , for dereliction of duty, further to an adverse ruling from the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, against which an appeal was then filed. The complainant emphasizes that the labour inspectorate initially decided in their favour. It believes that there are anti-union motives behind their transfer and dismissal ' which it considers contrary to the legislation and the collective agreement ' in relation to their activities in defence of workers' rights, and considers that there has been a failure to comply with the law.
.The Committee notes that the Government categorically rejects the allegation of any anti-union motives for the transfers, and points out that they occurred in the context of the restructuring of the Ministry of Education, which entailed the abolition of the unit in which the three union officials and other workers were employed. In that context, the dismissal of the three officials was permitted under the legislation in force but the Government opted to maintain their employment and their salaries through the transfers, taking account of the urgent need of the service to fill teaching posts in schools in the same area. The Government also indicates that it has harmonious and respectful relations with the many trade union organizations in the teaching sector and that the collective agreement (signed by  trade unions) is renewed every two years. Lastly, the Government states that the interested parties have been able to take and are still taking legal and judicial action in defence of their rights.
.In the light of the Government s explanations, the Committee considers that it has insufficient information ' at least for now ' to be able to conclude that the transfer and subsequent dismissal of the three officials were on anti-union grounds. The Committee observes that the interested parties, after various appeals, have brought an action in the labour court, which, apart from being due to rule on the anti-union motivation, will probably have to decide whether the decision of the Ministry of Education to transfer them, according to the allegations, from posts as national supervisors at the Ministry headquarters to posts as classroom teachers constitutes an infringement of labour law. The Committee further observes that the following are pending: () according to the allegations, an appeal filed by the interested parties to overturn the adverse ruling issued by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice; and () according to the Government, an appeal for amparo against the dismissal decision issued by the administrative authority further to the abovementioned ruling.
.In view of the above, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any rulings handed down in relation to the events described in the allegations.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any rulings handed down with respect to the transfer and subsequent dismissal of trade union officials Mr William Jos Morales Peralta, Mr Randy Arturo Hernndez Lpez and Mr Orlando Jos Jimnez Hernndez.",1,2011,Nicaragua

The complainant claims, as in the case of the decision against which they are appealing, to have been penalized by negligence on the part of the Departmental Inspectorates of the Ministry of Labour in the form of late transmission of the list of demands.B. The Government s reply
.In its communication of  October  the Government states that, on Friday,  December , at the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Managua, Branch I (Oral Proceedings for Labour Administrative Matters), Ministry of Labour, a list of demands was received, signed on the same date by the Labour Affairs Secretary of the Municipal Union of Technical and General Education Workers of Granada, the Labour Affairs Secretary of the Union of Schoolteachers and General Service Workers of NERPE  Mercedes Mondragn' of Granada, the General Secretary of the Democratic Education Workers' Union of Diriomo and the Finance Secretary of the SITRAVICE ranada. The aforementioned list of demands was made versus the MINED.
.On  December , the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Managua, Branch I (Oral Proceedings for Labour Administrative Matters), issued an order relating to the admission and referral of the list of demands to the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation, notifying the parties concerned (the MINED and the trade union organizations) as required by law. On  December , the aforementioned list of demands was received at the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation and, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, a conciliator was appointed to hold a preliminary hearing, the date for which was set as  January . The Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation was informed that lists of demands were still being received at the Departmental Inspectorate from certain trade unions, and these demands were being verified for compliance with the requirements of section  of the Labour Code. Accordingly, on Wednesday,  January , a communication was addressed to the parties that had been summoned to a preliminary hearing due on Tuesday,  January , informing them that the hearing had been suspended in order to ensure greater representation of the teachers.
.The Government states that on Thursday,  January , the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation received a communication signed by the Director-General of the MINED, indicating that negotiations had been in progress with the trade unions in",0,2010,Nicaragua
6,"the education sector since Wednesday,  December , in accordance with sections  and  of the Labour Code. On  January , the parties agreed andsigned the collective agreement for ' . The agreement was negotiated directly between the parties, namely: the General Confederation of Education Workers of Nicaragua (CGTEN ANDEN), the Nicaraguan Confederation of Education and Culture Workers (CONFENITEC), the Trade Union Confederation of Education Workers (CSTE), the MECD '  June' Workers' and Teachers' Federation, the  Lolita Soriano de Guerrero' Schoolteachers' Federation of the Department of Managua, the  Profesor Emmanuel Mongalo y Rubio' Education Workers' Federation, the Trade Union Confederation of Teachers of Nicaragua, the MECD Headquarters Workers' Union, the  Miguel Ramrez Goyena' Workers' Union, the  Miguel Bonilla Obando' Autonomous Education Workers' Union and the  Educational Independence' Workers' Union, on the one hand, and the MINED, on the other.
.The Government indicates that the director of collective bargaining and conciliation complied with the terms of section  of the Labour Code, which states that collective agreements may be concluded by direct settlement and shall then be submitted to the Ministry of Labour for verification of their compliance with the law and for registration. The director was careful to ensure that the aforementioned agreement would in no way restrict the rights conferred on the MINED workers by the Constitution, the Labour Code or any other labour legislation. Subsequently, by means of an order of Thursday,  January , the director issued an instruction at the request of the parties to register the '  MINED collective agreement and shelved the procedures launched in relation to the negotiations concerning the lists of demands before the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation. The parties were notified accordingly on Thursday,  January .
.On Monday,  February , a formal appeal was filed against the order of Thursday,  January  by the Labour Affairs Secretary of the Municipal Union of Technical and General Education Workers of Granada, the Labour Affairs Secretary of the Union of Schoolteachers and General Service Workers of NERPE  Mercedes Mondragn' of Granada, the General Secretary of the Democratic Education Workers' Union of Diriomo and the Finance Secretary of the SITRAVICE ranada.
.On Monday,  February , the Director of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation issued an order admitting the appeals and instructed the appellants to bring their grievances within  hours before the Directorate-General of Collective Rights and Labour Consultancy. On Wednesday,  February  a communication was submitted by the Labour Affairs Secretary of the Municipal Union of Technical and General Education Workers of Granada setting forth the grievances relating to the order of Thursday,  January  issued by the Director of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation, as referred to above.
.The Directorate-General of Collective Rights and Labour Consultancy, by means of Decision No. - of  March , decided on Monday,  February  to dismiss the appeal and uphold the order of Thursday,  January  issued by the Director of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation.
.As regards the grievances caused and the violations of the constitutional and legal fundamentals alleged by the complainant, the Government states that the workers' constitutional rights established in article () of the Constitution and in the Labour Code have been preserved inasmuch as the inalienable right of trade union organizations and employers to conclude collective agreements was respected, by means of dialogue and negotiation aimed at direct settlement between the parties, as in the case of the MINED collective agreement for ' , which was negotiated by various trade union organizations and the employer. Under the provisions of labour law, the terms of a collective agreement shall apply to all persons in the categories covered by the agreement who work at the enterprise, business or workplace concerned, even if they are not union members, as laid down by section  of the Labour Code. This provision gives legal certainty to both parties to the labour relationship. On the one hand, the workers have the certainty of the collective agreement which applies to them and, on the other hand, the employer knows which collective agreement applies, since it would be impossible to apply, five, six or ten different collective agreements. The Ministry of Labour, through the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Managua, Branch I (Oral Proceedings for Labour Administrative Matters), the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation, and the Directorate-General of Collective Rights and Labour Consultancy acted in accordance with the law.
.Section  of the Labour Code empowers the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Managua, Branch I (Oral Proceedings for Labour Administrative Matters) to verify compliance with the requirements laid down in the said section, in relation to lists of demands. In the present case, the inspectorate admitted in due time and form the complainants' list of demands, which was referred in turn to the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation. Finally, the Government declares that the complainant trade union organizations enjoy full exercise of the union rights conferred on them by the Constitution, the Labour Code and all other labour legislation.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the Autonomous Workers' Federation of Nicaragua (CTN A) alleges that several of its affiliated organizations in the Department of Granada submitted a list of demands on  December  to the Departmental Labour Inspectorate in Managua with the aim of signing a collective agreement with the MINED in view of the expiry of the current agreement, but although the list of demands was admitted and a mediator was appointed, the Directorate of Collective Bargaining at the Ministry of Labour stated that the list of demands was received after the start of direct negotiations between the MINED and other trade union organizations and ordered the registration of a collective agreement concluded by the latter for the '  period. According to the CTN A, its affiliated organizations have been harmed by the negligence (or the negligence alleged by the complainant) of the departmental inspectorates as a result of the late transmission of its list of demands to the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation at the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee notes that: () the Government confirms the statements by the CTN A regarding the submission of a list of demands by a group of affiliated organizations on  December  and the receipt by the Directorate of Collective Bargaining at the Ministry of Labour of a communication from the MINED on  January , indicating that as from  December  it had initiated negotiations with other trade union organizations (four national confederations, three federations and three trade unions), with which it signed a collective agreement for the '  period; () the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation at the Ministry of Labour ordered registration of the collective agreement and shelved the procedures launched in relation to the negotiations concerning the list of demands submitted by the organizations affiliated to the CTN A; () the latter organizations appealed against the decision to register the collective agreement for '  concluded by the other organizations, and, in March , the Directorate-General of Collective Rights and Labour Consultancy at the Ministry of Labour dismissed the appeal; () the workers' rights established in both the Constitution and the Labour Code have been preserved inasmuch as the inalienable right of trade union organizations and employers to conclude collective agreements was respected and, under the provisions of labour law, the terms of a collective agreement shall apply to all persons in the categories covered by the agreement who work at the enterprise, business or workplace concerned, even if they are not union members; () this provision gives legal certainty to the parties to the labour relationship, since the workers have the certainty of the collective agreement that applies to them and the employer knows which collective agreement applies, since the law does not permit the application of several different collective agreements; and () the various levels of the labour administrative authority acted in accordance with the law.
.In this regard, the Committee considers that it cannot determine with certainty whether in the present case there was negligence or bad faith on the part of the labour inspectorates in the procedure involving the late communication to the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation at the Ministry of Labour of the list of demands submitted by the organizations affiliated to the complainant. However, as regards the alleged delay in transmission of the list of demands, the Committee notes that the organizations affiliated to the complainant (primary trade unions and a federation in the education sector in the Department of Granada) opted for presentation of the list of demands to the administrative authority instead of contacting the MINED directly. On the contrary, the Committee observes that the organizations which signed the collective agreement (including four national confederations in the education sector) with the MINED opted for direct negotiation with that Ministry.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that it was not informed that the complainant or its affiliated organizations had filed a complaint with",0,2010,Nicaragua
7,"the judicial authority for damages suffered as a result of the Ministry of Labour s dismissal of the appeal against the decision to register the collective agreement in question. In addition, the complainant has not furnished any proof of the greater representativeness of its affiliated organizations in the education sector; on the other hand, the Government emphasizes that the signatories to the collective agreement include four national confederations in the education sector. Taking all the above information into account, the Committee will not pursue examination of this case.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to consider that this case does not call for further examination.",1,2010,Nicaragua
8,".The Committee last examined this case regarding dismissals and transfers of trade union officials and members at its June  meeting, when it noted that the Government had reported that: () a decision in first instance was pending for the judicial proceedings pertaining to the dismissal of Mr Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez, Ms Jazmn del Sagrario Carballo Soto and Mr Rolando Delgado Miranda, of the Nicaraguan Institute of Social Security (INSS); () no decision had been handed down for the judicial proceedings initiated by the dismissed workers of ENACAL Granada and the situation had not changed since the communication of  December ; and () a decision in first instance was pending for the judicial action for reinstatement of the trade union official, Mr Ricardo Francisco Arista Bolaos, against the Directorate General of Revenues (DGI), in process at that time before the First Labour Court of the Judicial District of Managua. The Committee expected the judicial authorities to hand down a decision shortly and requested the Government to keep it informed in that respect [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication of  November , the Government reports that: () Ms Jazmn del Sagrario Carballo Soto withdrew her complaint against the INSS and continues to be an active worker in the institution; () the court rejected the request for reinstatement filed by Mr Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez, and during the judicial proceedings it was noted that the person in question demonstrated no interest in those proceedings; () the court rejected the request for reinstatement filed by Mr Rolando Delgado Miranda, who moreover has received a pension from that institution since ; () the First Court of the Judicial District of Managua rejected the claim for reinstatement and payment of unpaid wages filed by Mr Ricardo Francisco Arista Bolaos; furthermore, the worker in question has not been to collect the settlement of wages made available to him; and () as regards the judicial proceedings filed by the workers dismissed from ENACAL Granada in December , the First Civil Court of the Judicial District of Granada issued a ruling and referred the case to the Second Civil Court of the Judicial District of Granada, which is responsible for paying six former workers of the company, who have already been notified.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.The Committee last examined this case regarding dismissals and transfers of trade union officials and members at its March  meeting, and on that occasion it requested the Government to: (a) keep it informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings pertaining to the dismissal of Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez, Jazmn del Sagrario Carballo Soto and Rolando Delgado Miranda, of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS); (b) keep it informed of the outcome of the current judicial proceedings initiated by the dismissed workers of the company ENACAL Granada; and (c) keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial action for reinstatement of the trade union official, Ricardo Francisco Arista Bolaos, against the Directorate General of Revenues (DGI), which is currently in process before the First Labour Court of the Judicial District of Managua. Likewise, the Committee once again urged the Government to take measures, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that in the future responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies with an independent body that has the confidence of the parties involved [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication dated  October , the Government indicates that: () a decision in first instance is currently pending for the judicial proceedings pertaining to the dismissal of Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez, Jazmn del Sagrario Carballo Soto and Rolando Delgado Miranda, of the INSS; () no decision has been handed down for the judicial proceedings initiated by the dismissed workers of ENACAL Granada and the situation has not changed since the communication of  December ; and () a decision in first instance is pending for the judicial action for reinstatement of the trade union official, Ricardo Arista Bolaos, against the DGI, currently in process before the First Labour Court of the Judicial District of Managua.
.The Committee takes note of this information. Recalling that justice delayed is justice denied [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ], the Committee expects the judicial authorities to hand down a decision shortly with regard to all the abovementioned cases and requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting in November  [see the Committee s th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session]. The Central Workers' Confederation of Nicaragua (CTN) submitted new allegations and additional information in communications dated  and  December .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February,  March,  June and  December .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in November , the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of union officials and members of the Workers' and Employees' Union of the INSS, the Committee expects that the current legal actions initiated by some of these officials and members will be concluded in the near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of these legal actions;(b) The Committee urges the Government to make every effort to bring about talks between the parties with a view to the reinstatement, ordered by the judicial authority, of Mr Fidel Castillo Lagos, Minutes Secretary of the Genaro Lazo Union of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel (ENACAL Estel) and that the indemnity already paid to Mr Lagos be taken into account in this regard. The Committee also requests the complainant organization to send the names of the other  members allegedly dismissed, as requested by the Government in its previous reply, so that the Government can send its observations;(c) As regards the allegations concerning the dismissals of eight officials of the Eastern Services Territorial Unit Workers' Union (UTSO), nine officials of the ENACAL Granada Workers' Departmental Union, and five officials of the ENACAL Carazo Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, the Committee urges the Government: () to take measures, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that, in future, responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies with an independent body that has the confidence of the parties involved; () to inform it more precisely of the requirements which the organizations are said not to have met, thus leading to the declaration that the strike was illegal which subsequently gave rise to the dismissal of the trade union officials, in order that it may express its view on this matter in full possession of the facts; and () to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings initiated by a number of workers at ENACAL ranada and ENACAL Carazo. The Committee requests the Government in this regard to inform it whether the trade union officials mentioned by name by the complainant organization have initiated legal action in connection with their dismissals; and(d) The Committee expects that the judicial authority that examines the legal action for reinstatement initiated by the trade union official Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, who was dismissed from the Directorate-General of Revenues, will give its ruling in the near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of these proceedings.
.In its comments of  and  December , the Central Workers' Confederation of Nicaragua (CTN-autnoma) states that the Directorate-General of Revenues (DGI) refuses to comply with the ruling handed down on  July , by which the judicial authority ordered the reinstatement and/or payment of double compensation to Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, Membership Secretary of the Public Employees' Union in the Directorate-General of Granada (SEPGRADGI). The CTN-autnoma adds that, without even having implemented the judicial ruling in favour of Ms Vivas Ramos, on  November  the authorities of the Directorate-General of Revenues (DGI) ordered the dismissal of Mr Ricardo Francisco Arista Bolaos, who had been employed as an auditor A by the Directorate-General of Revenues of Granada since  September , and was elected on  September  as a spokesperson of the executive committee of the CTN-autnoma.
.The complainant organization adds that Mr Arista Bolaos, availing himself of his trade union immunity, lodged a formal complaint to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour which, in the first instance, tried to dismiss the complaint by incorrectly invoking article  of the Labour Code, against which an appeal was promptly and duly lodged, resulting in an administrative decision nine months later that the dismissal of Mr Arista Bolaos was illegal. An order for his reinstatement was issued, but this was clearly disregarded by the DGI, and the complaint has been pending with the judicial authorities since September .
.CTN-autnoma",1,2007,Nicaragua
9,"states that the Civil and Labour Affairs Chamber of the Eastern District Appeals Court ruled that the appeal lodged by the general legal representative of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company (ENACAL) was unfounded, thereby confirming as final the decision handed down on  October  by the Local Civil and Labour Affairs Court under the jurisdiction of Jinotepe which upheld the complaint filed by the ENACAL Carazo unionized workers affiliated to the CTN. These workers were illegally dismissed on  May , and have to date neither been reinstated nor received payment of the amount due to them in law.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that Mr Ricardo Francisco Arista Bolaos initiated a legal action for reinstatement with the Managua District First District Labour Affairs Court against the DGI. This case is currently pending and awaits a decision by the judicial authority of first instance. The DGI is nevertheless prepared to comply with the requirements of the judicial authorities once all existing remedies have been exhausted. With respect to the case of Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, a final ruling was given in her favour. This ruling was handed down by the district labour affairs judge through the jurisdiction of the City of Granada, and stipulates that the DGI must reinstate Ms Vivas Ramos in her post and on the same terms as before. The institution was unable to comply with the decision since the post that Ms Vivas Ramos used to occupy no longer exists. In this context, it was referred to the judicial authority, in accordance with the provisions of article , paragraph , of the Labour Code, with respect to the termination of her employment and the calculation of all benefits due to her in relation to such termination, and in accordance with the special law that regulates the actions of the State of the Republic of Nicaragua. It is clear that no violations of labour law have taken place and the parties have availed themselves of their rights under the law at every stage of the labour proceedings initiated in the courts where they have lodged their respective complaints.
.In its communications of  February,  June and  December , the Government states in relation to the recommendations made in the Committee s th Report, paragraph , and on the outcome of current judicial proceedings in connection with the dismissals of the workers of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS), that this institution reported that the respective settlements had been paid, including the social benefits to which Mr Sergio Juan Ramn Quiroz, Ms Magda del Carmen Reyes Lpez, Mr Fabricio Jos Sevilla, Mr Allan Antonio Gonzlez Torrez, Ms Vilma Isabel Munguia Guillen, Ms Ftima del Rosario Prez Canales and Mr Josman Octavio Solis Nuez were entitled. On the other hand, Ercilia Aguilera Centeno and Giany Castillo Tercero and Margarita del Carmen Snchez Mndez withdrew their legal action for reinstatement. The cases of Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez, Jazmn del Sagrario Carballo Soto and Rolando Delegado Miranda are still awaiting a ruling of first instance.
.With regard to Mr Fidel Castillo Lagos, it was reported that compensation payments in lieu of reinstatement were made on  May , as prescribed in article  of the Labour Code, and, with no other settlement payment outstanding, on  March  a letter was sent to the Local Civil and Labour Affairs Court clearly outlining all payments made by the company and received by Mr Fidel Castillo Lagos.
.As regards the workers of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company ' ENACAL of Granada, the company said that it had paid settlements to the workers and complied with the ruling handed down by the Civil and Labour Affairs Chamber of the Southern District Appeals Court, and no payment was outstanding. It also reported that a ruling was due on a judicial complaint filed by  workers.
.As for the case of the workers of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company ' ENACAL of Carazo, the company reported that it had complied with the order of the local civil and labour affairs judge under the jurisdiction of Jinotepe-Carazo and had reached an agreement with workers and their trade union representative on a four-instalment payment, and they had already received their first instalment.
.Regarding the cases of Mr Ricardo Francisco Arista Bolaos and Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, the DGI stated the following: () Mr Arista Bolaos, availing himself of his rights under the labour laws of the Republic of Nicaragua, initiated a legal action for reinstatement with the Managua District First District Labour Affairs Court against the DGI; and () as regards Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, a final ruling was given in her favour. That ruling was handed down by the District Labour Affairs Court of the City of Granada and stipulates that the DGI must reinstate Ms Vivas Ramos in the same post and on the same terms as before. Given the impossibility of complying with this decision, since the post formerly occupied by Ms Vivas Ramos no longer exists, it was referred to the judicial authority, in accordance with article , paragraph , of the Labour Code of the Republic of Nicaragua, which reads as follows:  When there is a ruling in favour of reinstatement and the employer fails to comply with the judicial decision, the employer shall pay the worker, in addition to compensation for years of service, a sum equivalent to one hundred per cent of the same.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Committee recalls that the complainant organization in the present case had alleged numerous dismissals of trade union officials and members. At its meeting in November , the Committee made a number of interim recommendations.Recommendation (a)
.At its meeting in November , the Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the legal proceedings in connection with the dismissal of trade union officials and members of the Workers' and Employees' Union of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s information that an appropriate settlement, including social benefits, was paid to seven workers, three workers withdrew the reinstatement proceedings which they had initiated, and a ruling of first instance is due on the cases of Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez, Jazmn del Sagrario Carballo Soto and Rolando Delgado Miranda. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of current legal proceedings.Recommendation (b)
.The Committee urged the Government to make every effort to bring about talks between the parties with a view to the reinstatement, ordered by the judicial authority, of the trade union official, Mr Fidel Castillo Lagos, Minutes Secretary of the Genaro Lazo Union of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel (ENACALEstel), and that the compensation already paid to Mr Lagos be taken into account. The Committee notes the Government s information that the company paid the trade union official in question compensation for non-reinstatement as provided for in article  of the Labour Code in May , and that it informed the Local Civil and Labour Affairs Court of this payment on  March .
.The Committee also recalls that, at its  meeting, it requested the complainant organization, as had the Government, to send the names of the other  members allegedly dismissed, so that the Government could send its observations. In this regard, given that the complainant organization has failed to provide the information requested, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations.Recommendation (c)
.The Committee requested the Government to provide information on the outcome of the judicial complaints filed by trade union officials and workers of the ENACAL Granada and ENACAL Carazo companies (in connection with this company, the complainant organization alleges that in December  the workers remained illegally dismissed and had not been reinstated or paid appropriate compensation) as a result of their dismissals. The Committee notes the Government s information that: () the ENACAL Granada company had complied with the ruling handed down by the Civil and Labour Affairs Chamber of the Southern District Appeals Court, paid the settlement to the workers, and a judicial complaint initiated by  dismissed workers is still in process; and () the ENACAL Carazo company stated that it had complied with the local civil and labour affairs judge s order and reached a pay agreement with the workers and their trade union representative.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the current legal proceedings initiated by the dismissed workers of the ENACAL Granada company.Recommendation (d)
.The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings for reinstatement initiated by the trade union official Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, who had been dismissed by the Directorate-General of Revenues (DGI). In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s information that: () a final ruling was given in favour of the trade union official and provides that the Directorate-General of Revenues must reinstate her",1,2007,Nicaragua
10,"in the same post and on the same terms as before; () it is impossible to comply with this ruling, since the post which she used to occupy no longer exists; and () the ruling was referred to the judicial authorities, in accordance with article , paragraph , which stipulates that when there is a ruling in favour of reinstatement and the employer fails to comply with the judicial decision, the employer must pay the worker, in addition to compensation for years of service, a sum equivalent to one hundred per cent of the same.
.The Committee also notes that the complainant organization alleges the dismissal of the trade union official Mr Ricardo Francisco Arista Bolaos from the DGI, on  November . In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s information that the trade union official in question initiated legal action for reinstatement with the Managua District First District Labour Affairs Court against the DGI. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of these proceedings.
.More generally, the Committee observes that, in its reply, the Government does not deny that the alleged dismissals referred to in the complaint constituted anti-union discrimination, and that in several of the alleged cases the judicial authorities ordered the reinstatement of trade union officials or members and that there was a failure to comply with those rulings as a result of the payment of compensation prescribed by law. The Committee expresses its concern at the fact that it would appear, even in the cases where it was clear that there had been an anti-union dismissal, that the employer can choose between reinstatement or payment of compensation equivalent to the amount due for the worker s years of service. In this regard, the Committee recalls that no one should be subjected to discrimination or prejudice with regard to employment because of legitimate trade union activities or membership, and the persons responsible for such acts should be punished [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , para. ]. In addition, on a number of occasions the Committee has emphasized that in the event of the dismissal of trade union officials or members on account of their trade union membership or activities, the best solution is the reinstatement of the workers in their posts and that, in cases where an independent competent body determines, for compelling and objective reasons, that reinstatement in that specific post is no longer possible, steps must be taken to ensure that the complainants receive full and adequate compensation and that there are sufficiently dissuasive sanctions in place to deter anti-union dismissals.

.In its communication of  June , the Government states the following with regard to the Committee s recommendations.Recommendation (a)
.On  February , the Executive Board of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS) met and, with administrative Act No. /, approved a new organizational structure, which involved the abolition of the  Technical Medical Evaluation Unit (UTEM)' and the creation of the  Quality Assurance Directorate (DGC)' as a body of the Health Services Provider Institutions (IPSS). The DGC is subordinate to the General Directorate for Health Services and is the authority responsible for monitoring implementation of existing regulations in the area of quality control and treatment and guidance for beneficiaries, with a view to maintaining the services provided by the IPSS in accordance with the General Health Law No.  adopted on  March  and its implementing regulations in Decree No. - approved on  January , and with the Social Security Law and implementing regulation No. . The objective is to ensure the correct functioning of the IPSS through follow-up and monitoring of quality standards and indicators.
.The main function of the DGC is to implement, organize and coordinate with the IPSS various procedures, strategies and standards to facilitate improved health care, health quality management, and guidance and care for patients, on the basis of the integrated health-care model. The studies that have been carried out show that in order to achieve the objectives put forward by the INSS, it is necessary to modify the current staff profile of Medical Supervisory Professionals to Social Work Professionals, which meant a radical change in this area. Before undertaking these changes, approval was obtained from the Public Service Directorate, a state authority which, in accordance with section  of the Civil Service and Administrative Career Law (No. ), is the competent body to authorize restructuring in state institutions.
.These organizational reforms and",1,2007,Nicaragua
11,"restructuring in the INSS had been approved by the INSS executive board which, under the terms of section  of the Social Security Law, is the highest executive body and has the following membership: (a) two representatives of the State, namely, an executive president and executive vice-president of the institution; (b) two workers' representatives with their substitutes, elected by the workers' organizations; and (c) two employers' representatives with their substitutes: one for the public sector enterprises and one for the private sector, elected by their respective organizations. It will be noted that the INSS, before terminating the employment contracts of the persons mentioned in the complaint, had obtained the approval of its highest executive body.
.As regards the results of the current legal proceedings concerning the dismissals of the trade union leaders and members who did not abandon legal action, including Mr Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez and Mr Sergio Juan Quiroz, the case is still at the stage of receiving evidence and the judge has not yet given a ruling.Recommendation (b)
.The Government states in relation to the application for reinstatement filed by Mr Fidel Castillo Lago against the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel (ENACAL-Estel), that he was dismissed in accordance with section  of the Labour Code on  April . He received final net severance pay of ,. crdobas. He filed an application for reinstatement with the local civil and industrial court on  October , and the judge ordered his reinstatement in the same post, on the same terms and conditions as before. Among other reasons, the judge cited the fact that Mr Fidel Castillo Lago had trade union immunity at the time of his dismissal, which was therefore not in keeping with his position as a member of the trade union executive body. ENACAL appealed against the ruling.
.On  December , the civil and labour affairs division of the Estel Appeals Court upheld the ruling of the local civil and labour judge. ENACAL decided to avail itself of its right under section , paragraph , of the Labour Code and pay the double compensation required by that provision. Since Mr Fidel Castillo Lago had already received the sum of ,. crdobas, he was awarded a further sum of ,. crdobas, a sum which included the compensation referred to in section  of the Labour Code. In February , Mr Fidel Castillo Lago was informed that a cheque made out to him was available at the central pay office of ENACAL, for the aforementioned sum, but he has not to date collected the cheque. According to legislation and a considerable body of jurisprudence, when a worker receives the social benefits owed to him or her at the end of an employment contract, the only legal action that can be initiated is that of enforcing payment in the event that the employer fails to pay in full, or in cases where reinstatement proceedings are invalid because severance pay has already been received.
.As regards the alleged dismissals of  other union members, the identity of the individuals concerned is not known because the complainant organization has failed to supply relevant details.Recommendation (c)
.The Government reiterates the information already provided. It also maintains that the compliant organization does not indicate which of the organization s members have initiated legal action in connection with this dispute at the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company (ENACAL-Granada-Carazo).Recommendation (d)
.The Government reports that it has no knowledge of any notice regarding any legal claim that might have been filed against ENACAL by officials and members of the democratic trade union of ENACAL.Recommendation (e)
.The Government states that it has no information concerning any legal action against the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company (ENACAL-Juigalpa) initiated by Mr Kester Giovanni Bermdez, an official of the Independent ENACAL Workers' Union, Chontales Department, or by eight other workers employed by ENACAL-Juigalpa.Recommendation (f)
.As regards the case of Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos in her capacity as official of the Public Employees' Union in the Directorate-General of Revenues of Granada, the Government states that the Managua departmental labour inspectorate (services sector), on  January , issued a resolution guaranteeing her constitutional rights and trade union immunity. Ms Vivas Ramos subsequently applied to the courts for reinstatement in her post and payment of wages owed to her, and a ruling on the case is due.
.The Committee recalls that the complainant organization in the present case had alleged numerous dismissals of trade union leaders and members, as well as the exclusion of trade unions from the collective bargaining process in a number of public institutions and state enterprises. At its meeting in November , the Committee made a number of interim recommendations.Recommendation (a)
.At its meeting in November , the Committee requested the Government to inform it whether the Workers' and Employees' Union of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (STEINSS) had been consulted about the restructuring which took place and which allegedly prejudiced ten trade union officials and  members. In this respect, the Committee notes that: () on  February  the executive board of the INSS met and approved the new organizational structure; () the changes had been approved by the Public Service Directorate (the body responsible for authorizing restructuring in state institutions); () these organizational changes and restructuring in the Institute had been authorized in advance by the Institute s executive board, which includes two representatives of the State, two workers' representatives elected by workers' organizations, and two employers' representatives; and () before terminating the employment contracts of the workers named in the complaint, the Institute had obtained the approval of its highest executive body. Taking this information into account, and given that consultations did take place, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.The Committee also requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings in connection with the dismissals of trade union officials and members who did not withdraw their legal actions. The Committee notes the Government s information according to which the legal proceedings involving, among others, Mr Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez and Mr Sergio Juan Quiroz, are at the stage of receiving evidence. Under these circumstances, the Committee expects that the current legal proceedings will be concluded in the very near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome.Recommendation (b)
.The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial process under way in connection with the dismissal of the trade union official Mr Fidel Castillo Lago, Minutes Secretary of the Genaro Lazo Union of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel (ENACAL-Estel). The Committee notes the Government s information that: () on  October , the local civil and labour judge ordered the reinstatement of Mr Fidel Castillo Lago, citing among other reasons the fact that he enjoyed trade union immunity at the time of his dismissal, which was not, therefore, in keeping with his position as a member of the union s executive body; () the company appealed against that ruling and, on  December , the civil and labour division of the Estel appeals court upheld the local court s ruling; () the company decided to avail itself of its right under section , paragraph , of the Labour Code and implement the double compensation payment; and () in February , Mr Fidel Castillo Lago was informed that a cheque had been made out in his name but he has, to date, not collected it.
.The Committee recalls that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions, and that it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. , is granted by legislation in cases where employers can, in practice, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, dismiss any worker, if the true reason is the worker s trade union membership or activities [Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee, taking into account these principles, and noting that the judicial authority has ordered the reinstatement of the union official Mr Fidel Castillo Lagos, that his dismissal was not in keeping with his position as a union official, and also that according to the Government the union official in question has not collected the compensation, the Committee urges the Government to make every effort to bring about talks between the parties in order to obtain the reinstatement ordered by the judicial authority",1,2007,Nicaragua
12,"and that the indemnity already paid to Mr Lagos be taken into account in this regard.
.In addition the Committee requested the Government to send its observations on the alleged dismissals of  other union members. The Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that it does not know who these  members are, since no details have been provided. In these circumstances, and as the Government had requested in its previous reply, the Committee requests the complainant organization to communicate the names of the  allegedly dismissed members of the Genaro Lazo Union, so that the Government can send its own observations.Recommendation (c)
.As regards the allegations concerning the dismissal of eight officials of the Eastern Services Territorial Unit Workers' Union (UTSO), nine officials of the ENACAL-Granada Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, and five officials of the ENACAL-Carazo Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, the Committee requested the Government: () to take measures, including of a legislative character if necessary, so that, in future, a body independent of the parties, and in which they have confidence, would be responsible for declaring a strike illegal; () to inform it more precisely concerning the legal requirements that the organizations did not respect and which led to the strike being declared illegal and the subsequent dismissal of the trade union officials, in order to be able to pronounce itself in full knowledge of the facts; and () to inform it of the results of the legal claims filed by certain ENACAL-Granada and ENACAL-Carazo workers. In this regard, the Committee requested the Government to inform it whether the trade union officials mentioned by name by the complainant organization had initiated legal actions relating to their dismissal.
.In this regard, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates the observations sent at the time in relation to these allegations, and that the Government adds that the complainant organization does not indicate which of the union members have initiated legal actions in relation to the dispute at the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company (ENACAL). The Committee recalls that, when it examined these allegations at its meeting in November , it noted that  on  June , certain ENACAL-Granada workers filed a claim for reinstatement in the District Civil and Industrial Court in the department of Granada' and that  on  June , ENACALCarazo workers filed a legal appeal in Jinotepe' [st Report, para. ]. Under these circumstances, the Committee reiterates the recommendations it made at the time including those concerning the declaration of a strike to be illegal, and urges the Government to send the information requested without delay.Recommendation (d)
.The Committee requested the Government to confirm that all the five trade union officials and  members of the ENACAL-DAR Democratic Trade Union who had been dismissed had not initiated legal actions. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s statements to the effect that it has no knowledge of any notice of legal action filed by the trade union officials or members in question against the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company (ENACAL).Recommendation (e)
.The Committee requested the Government to indicate whether legal actions had commenced in connection with the alleged dismissal of Mr Kester Giovanni Bermdez, official of the Independent ENACAL Workers' Union, Chontales Department, and eight other workers of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Juigalpa. The Committee notes that according to the Government, it has no information on any legal action in this regard. Taking this information into account, the Committee will not continue its examination of these allegations unless the complainant organization provides additional information on any legal actions that may have been initiated.Recommendation (f)
.The Committee requested the Government to inform it whether by virtue of the decision of the Inspectorate General of Labour, reported by the Government, the trade union official Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos had been reinstated in her post in the DGI with payment of wages due. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s information that following the decision of the Inspectorate-General, Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos initiated legal action for reinstatement and a ruling in the case is due. Under these circumstances, the Committee expects that the judicial authority concerned will hand down a ruling in the near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of these proceedings.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of union officials and members of the Workers' and Employees' Union of the INSS, the Committee expects that the current legal actions initiated by some of these officials and members will be concluded in the near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of these legal actions.(b) The Committee urges the Government to make every effort to bring about talks between the parties with a view to the reinstatement, ordered by the judicial authority, of Mr Fidel Castillo Lagos, Minutes Secretary of the Genaro Lazo Union of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel (ENACAL Estel) and that the indemnity already paid to Mr Lagos be taken into account in this regard. The Committee also requests the complainant organization to send the names of the other  members allegedly dismissed, as requested by the Government in its previous reply, so that the Government can send its observations.(c) As regards the allegations concerning the dismissals of eight officials of the Eastern Services Territorial Unit Workers' Union (UTSO), nine officials of the ENACAL Granada Workers' Departmental Union, and five officials of the ENACAL Carazo Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, the Committee urges the Government: () to take measures, including legislative measures if necessary, to ensure that, in future, responsibility for declaring a strike illegal lies with an independent body that has the confidence of the parties involved; () to inform it more precisely of the requirements which the organizations are said not to have met, thus leading to the declaration that the strike was illegal which subsequently gave rise to the dismissal of the trade union officials, in order that it may express its view on this matter in full possession of the facts; and () to inform it of the outcome of the judicial proceedings initiated by a number of workers at ENACAL ranada and ENACAL Carazo. The Committee requests the Government in this regard to inform it whether the trade union officials mentioned by name by the complainant organization have initiated legal action in connection with their dismissals.(d) The Committee expects that the judicial authority that examines the legal action for reinstatement initiated by the trade union official Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, who was dismissed from the Directorate-General of Revenues, will give its ruling in the near future, and requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of these proceedings.
.The complaint is contained in a communication of the Central Workers' Confederation of Nicaragua (CTN) of  October .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the CTN states that despite all the constitutional and legal provisions and agreements which guarantee trade union rights, senior government officials in public institutions and state enterprises have systematically and flagrantly violated them, denying workers and their organizations the right to trade union freedom, collective bargaining and employment. According to the CTN, there is interference in the functioning of democratic trade unions, illegal mass dismissals without due process, including of trade union officials, and promotion of the formation of workers' organizations dominated by the authorities in order to place them under their control. In addition, collective agreements are being concluded with regressive clauses, in express violation of constitutional and legal provisions, and collective agreements. Specifically, the CTN alleges the following violations of trade union rights.Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS)
.The CTN alleges that by order of the former CEO, a retired army officer, the contracts of employment of  members and ten officials of the Workers' and Employees' Union of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (STEINSS) affiliated to the CTN were terminated, namely: Isabel Vanessa River Ubeda (General Secretary), Sergio Juan Ramn Quiroz (Organization and Propaganda Secretary), Karla Esperanza Molina Saavedra (Minutes Secretary), Moiss Ruiz Romero (Labour Affairs Secretary), Alvin Alaniz Gonzlez (Occupational Safety and Health Secretary), Karla del Rosario Alvarado Paz (Auditor), Ivette Pilarte (Spokesperson), Martha Caldern (Sectional), Fruto Plazaola (Sectional) and Luis Prez Mairena (Sectional).
.The CTN reports that on  and  March and  April , all these trade union officials and the majority of the dismissed employees, all union members, filed a formal claim for reinstatement and payment of unpaid wages in Labour Courts Nos One and Two. In reply to the claim, the CEO of the institution applied for an exception of lack of legal capacity, which",1,2007,Nicaragua
13,"was accepted by the industrial judicial authorities without any justification, as well, moreover, as failing to decide the matter in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code:  Any exception alleged without any justification in order to delay the proceedings shall be immediately refused and without recourse'  They did not order hearing of evidence of the claims, despite the fact that article  of the Labour Code establishes a mandatory period of  days for deciding the claim. The trade union officials appealed amparo in chambers one and two of the Managua Court of Appeal, whose judges ordered the INSS CEO to annul the appealed actions, but the president refused to obey the order, thus, as is the practice of the current government authorities, violating the provisions of article  of the Constitution  Orders and decisions of the courts and judges are binding on State authorities, organizations and the natural and legal persons concerned' The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Esteli
.The CTN alleges that, by order of the CEO, the contracts of employment of Mr Fidel Castillo Lago (Minutes Secretary), official of the  Genaro Lazo' Union and  other members were terminated.The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Matagalpa
.The CTN alleges that, by order of the CEO, the contracts of employment of  affiliated workers and five officials of the Enacal-Dar Matagalpa Democratic Trade Union, Juan Alberto Garca Blandn (General Secretary), Alejandro Martnez Rizo (Minutes Secretary), Buenaventura Polanco Senz (Treasurer), Salvador Montoya Herrera (Disputes Secretary) and Nahum Castro Aruz (Organization Secretary) were terminated.The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Granada
.The CTN alleges that, by order of the CEO, the contracts of employment of  employees, including eight officials of the Eastern Services Territorial Unit Workers' Union (UTSO) of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company, Jos Morales Mena (General Secretary), Gustavo Morales Chamorro (Disputes Secretary), Edgard Estrada Meja (Organization and Propaganda Secretary), Luis Ren Castillo Morales (Treasurer), Dario Lpez Cruz (Occupational Safety and Health Secretary), Martn Ernesto Martnez Guerra (Auditor), Ayabeth Martn Barrios Delgado (First Spokesperson) and Flix Meja Duval (Federation Organization and Propaganda Secretary) were terminated.
.The CTN adds that, by order of the CEO, the contracts of employment of  employees, including nine officials of the Enacal Granada Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, Manuel Salvador Juarro (General Secretary), Ricardo Ramos Laguna (Disputes Secretary), Mara Auxiliadora Castillo Hernndez (Minutes Secretary), Alvaro Jos Toruo Velis (Education, Culture and Sport Secretary), Miguel Martnez Lpez (Occupational Safety and Health Secretary), Andrs Maldonado Cisneros (Auditor), Auxiliadora Arias Madrigal (First Spokesperson), Lesbia del Carmen Ruiz Prez (Second Spokesperson) and Mario Jos Gutirrez Jaime (Federation Treasurer) were terminated. On  June ,  workers of the Enacal Company in Granada filed a formal claim for reinstatement in the same post and with identical conditions of work, payment of unpaid wages as well as social security contributions and benefits established by law and collective agreement before the judge in the Granada District Civil and Industrial Court. This claim was filed in accordance with the requirements laid down in article  of the Labour Code. In responding to the claim, the CEO of the company applied for the exception of lack of legal capacity on the grounds that her name is Ruth Herrera Montoya and not Ruth Selma Herrera Montoya. The result of this exception was an action which violates the provisions of articles  and  of the Labour Code, since in official documents she signed in the way she was addressed by the workers, but it happened that the judicial authority allowed the violation of the aforesaid articles.The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Carazo
.The CTN alleges that, by order of the CEO, the contracts of employment of  employees including five officials of the Enacal Carazo Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, Carlos Alonso Avelln Matus (General Secretary), Nicols Antonio Conrado Lpez (Disputes Secretary), Lorgia Marina Garca Prez (Treasurer), Jos Jirn Medrano (Safety and Health Secretary) and Manuel Cruz Garca (Auditor) were terminated.

.By order of the CEO, the contract of employment of the General Secretary of the Enacal Diriamba Workers' Union, Mr Lster Francisco Ortiz, was terminated.The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Jugalpa
.By order of the CEO, the contracts of employment of eight employees including Diriamba Workers' Union official, Mr Kester Geovani Bermdez, were terminated.National Technological Institute (INATEC)
.By order of the executive director, the transfer of Mr Ricardo Alvarez Berros (General Secretary) and Ms Gloria Paredes Snchez (Training Secretary) both of the Workers' Technical and Professional Staff Union of the INATEC was ordered, as a reprisal for demanding compliance with the collective agreement, thereby violating their right to security of tenure established by law. Under the legislation, the Departmental Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector of the Ministry of Labour, declared the transfers null and void and without any legal effect whatsoever, but the institute authorities refuse to comply with that decision.Directorate-General of Revenues (DGI)
.The CTN states that at the end of July , the authorities of the DGI and the trade unions there signed a new collective agreement, in which clause  provides as follows:Clause .?(Mutual Recognition).?The institution named the  Directorate General of Revenues' recognizes the following trade unions: Democratic Workers' Union of the Directorate General of Revenues (SEDDGI), the Public Workers' and Employees' Union in the Directorate General of Revenues, Leon Department Revenue Office (SITEPDGI-ARL), the Public Employees' Union in the DGI Granada (SEPGRA-DGI), the Independent Workers' Union of the Directorate General of Revenues (SITRADGI) and the Workers' Union in the Rivas Department Revenue Office of the Directorate General of Revenues (SITRARDI-DGI), as representative of the public employees and/or staff affiliated and non-affiliated to the trade unions which seek to represent them in the defence of their rights and socio-economic and labour interests and undertakes to negotiate with these organizations on individual and collective agreements, claims and disputes as the case may be. For their part, the trade unions SEDDGI, SITEPDGI-ARL, SEPGRA-DGI SITRADGI and SITRARDI-DGI shall recognize that the Directorate General of Revenues is responsible for the organization and planning necessary to allow it to exercise fully the management, fulfilment, compliance and monitoring of its functions. The foregoing shall be in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution of Nicaragua, the Civil Service and Administrative Service Act and its regulations, the current Labour Code, the Act on Acquired Rights and Conventions of the International Labour Organization ratified by Nicaragua and the collective agreement. Neither party shall be subject to any limitations other than those laid down in law and those which derive from the present collective agreement.
.The CTN alleges that, despite this, the new authorities of the institution signed a collective agreement with trade unions formed in  which are under its control with the acquiescence of the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, in flagrant breach of the abovementioned clause and the relevant provisions of national legislation and ILO Conventions. This act was appealed to the administrative authority, both to the Departmental Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector, and then to the Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation Directorate, since the former refused the list of demands submitted on  June , pursuant to paragraph (h) of article  of the Labour Code (when a trade union proposes a collective dispute of an economic or social character, it must submit to the relevant Departmental Labour Inspectorate a list of demands, an original and three copies, which contains, according to paragraph (h), the application for the list to be considered) and the latter concerning the conclusion of an agreement with regressive clauses without the participation of all the trade unions, which were not notified of the new agreement proposed by the Union of United Workers in Reconciliation (SNTUR-DGI-UNE) and the Tax Office Staff Union (SINTRACAF-UNE).

.Furthermore, the CTN alleges that the Director-General of Revenues, in breach of article  of the Constitution and articles  and  of the Labour Code, said that, as far as he was concerned, trade union office was not an obstacle to termination of the contract of employment of trade union officials, and he therefore ordered the dismissal of Ms",1,2007,Nicaragua
14,"Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, spokesperson of the SEPGRA-DGI, invoking for that purpose article  of Act No. , the Civil Service and Administrative Staff Act, which does not rank higher than the Constitution and the Labour Code.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the cases of the trade union officials were being heard, at the option of the parties, some by administrative proceedings in the Ministry of Labour and others in the industrial courts, in accordance with the procedures and processes laid down in Nicaraguan legislation for parties in dispute. Specifically, it states the following.Dismissals of officials of the Workers' and Employees' Union of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (STEINSS), affiliated to the CTN
.With regard to the dismissals of INSS trade union officials, the departmental labour inspectorate, service sector, stated that there was an initial complaint by the workers on  January  in relation to which a special inspection was carried out. However, the complainant (the workers' side) withdrew the complaint. On  February , the workers made a written submission in which they complained of the transfers and breach of trade union immunity as a result of which the inspectorate concerned issued three summons to the parties (employer and workers) with the aim of resolving the situation alleged by the workers concerned. The employer did not attend.
.A special inspection was carried out which found evidence of the transfer of  workers, as a result of which on  March , an order was made declaring null and void the transfers of the following trade union officials: Isabel Vanessa Rivera Ubeda, Sergio Quiroz, Karla Molina, Alvin Alans Gonzlez.

.With regard to the termination of the contract of employment of Mr Fidel Castillo Lagos, official of the  Genaro Lazo' Union, the Government reports that on  June , a claim was filed in the District Civil and Industrial Court, by operation of law against ENACALEstel. The case is in progress.ENACAL-Matagalpa
.Information was requested from the office of the ENACAL CEO, which reported that Juan Alberto Garca Blandn, Alejandro Martnez Rizo, Buena Ventura Polanco Senz, Salvador Montoya Herrera and Nahm Castro Aruz had accepted payments in final settlement. ENACAL has not been notified of any claim lodged by the abovementioned persons.ENACAL-Granada and ENACAL-Carazo
.Under decision No. - of the Inspectorate General of Labour of  May , it was established that the Inspectorate General of Labour was competent under articles  and  of the Labour Code to hear and decide the application by the legal attorney of ENACAL, who on  May  requested the Inspectorate to pronounce the illegality of the strike conducted by the workers of the Carazo and Granada divisions. The reports of the special inspections carried out by the Inspectorate General of Labour in this matter showed that the workers of the Carazo and Granada divisions had gone on strike without first exhausting the legal procedures, and had defaulted on their labour obligations by arbitrarily suspending their work, in relation to a claim of non-compliance with the collective agreement and negotiation of a new list of demands.
.The Government refers to the following decision of the labour inspectorate:  Irrespective of the reasons given by the workers of the ENACAL Carazo and Granada departments for demanding improvements in their social and labour rights, these do not allow or legitimize them in holding a collective stoppage of work, even though article  of the Constitution recognizes the labour right to complain against non-compliance with agreements of a social and labour character (article  of the Labour Code) and negotiation of lists of demands (article  and following of the Labour Code) and there are procedures, including for the exercise of the right to strike, article  of the Labour Code provides that clearly defined criteria must be satisfied and, in this case, it is clear that the workers of the departments concerned did not follow the correct procedure. This situation obliges the authority to declare the strike held by the workers of the Carazo and Granada departments illegal under the provisions of article  and following of the Labour Code. Thus in the light of these considerations, article  of the Constitution of Nicaragua, articles , , ,  and  of the Labour Code, the Inspectorate General decides: () that the application by the Legal Attorney of ENACAL that the strike be held to be illegal is justified. In consequence, the Inspectorate General of Labour declares the strike by the workers of the Carazo and Granada departmental divisions of ENACAL to be illegal; and () the striking workers must return to work within  hours, failing which the employer may deem the contracts of employment of those who continue with the illegal action to be terminated.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.The Government states that the dismissal of the striking workers at ENACAL Granada and Carazo was not because they were trade unionists or exercising a trade union right (which right is protected by labour law), but for breach of labour legislation and the decision given by the Inspectorate General of Labour. The Government adds that on  June , certain ENACAL (Granada) workers filed a claim for reinstatement in the District Civil and Industrial Court by operation of law in the department of Granada and that on  June , ENACAL (Carazo) workers filed a legal appeal in Jinotepe.ENACAL-Diriamba

.With regard to the refusal by the Managua Department Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector of the list of claims of  June , under paragraph  of article , submitted by the SITRADGI, the Government indicates that the Managua Department Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector refused the application because it had already been negotiated bilaterally with other trade unions and the DGI. On  July , the SITRADGI submitted to the Department Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector a request to negotiate a list of claims when it had already signed a new list of claims. The legal basis for refusing the list of claims in question was that a new collective agreement had already been signed.
.Furthermore, the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation received the collective agreement of the DGI on  July  for registration and filing, it having been negotiated directly and in accordance with articles  and  of the Labour Code by the following trade unions: the SNTUR-DGI-UNE and the SINTRACAF-UNE. The agreement was revised and certain rectifications were formulated. It was resubmitted on  July  and was signed by the Director of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation on  August  for registration.
.On  July , the SITRADGI and the SIERMA-DGI submitted a document complaining that the trade unions which negotiated the new collective agreement were not represented in the previous collective agreement and that they did not request to join it and thus the new agreement should not be registered in the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Conciliation. In this respect, an order was made on  July  which refused the application. Subsequently, a written submission was received on  August  from the following trade unions: the SITRADGI, the SIERMA-DGI and the SEPGRA-DGI which sent a communication to the ILO, requesting to join the collective agreement and withdraw the lists of demands submitted to the Ministry of Labour. The agreement was signed by all the trade unions mentioned in this report.
.With regard to the termination of the contract of employment of the trade union official, Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, who is spokesperson of the SEPGRA-DGI, a decision in favour of the worker was given by the Inspectorate General of Labour on  January .National Technological Institute (INATEC)
.With regard to this case, the Departmental Labour Inspectorate, Service Sector reported that on  July , an order was made which in its conclusion states:  the transfers of the workers and trade union officials Gloria del Carmen Paredes and Ricardo Ramn Alvarez Berrios are declared null and void' and this order was upheld on appeal on  September . In addition, the executive management of INATEC has stated that Mr Ricardo Ramn Alvarez Berrios and Ms Gloria del Carmen Paredes are working actively in their posts and with full respect for their labour and trade union rights.
.The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organization alleges numerous dismissals of trade union officials and members, and the exclusion of trade unions from a collective bargaining process in various public institutions and state enterprises.Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS)
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of ten officials (Isabel Vanessa River Ubeda, Sergio Juan Ramn Quiroz, Karla Esperanza Molina Saavedra, Moiss Ruiz Romero, Alvin Alanis Gonzlez, Karla del Rosario Alvarado Paz, Ivette Pilarte, Martha Caldern, Fruto Plazaola and Luis Prez Mairena) and  members of STEINSS, the Committee notes that the Government reports that: () in relation to the dismissals of the trade union officials, the Departmental Labour Inspectorate Service Sector stated that there was an initial complaint by the workers on  January  in relation to which a special inspection was carried out. However, the complainant (the workers' side) withdrew the complaint. On  February , the workers filed a written submission in which they complained of the transfers and breach of trade union rights as a result of which the Inspectorate concerned issued three summonses to the parties (employer and workers) with the aim of resolving the situation alleged by the workers concerned. The employer did not attend; () information was requested from the office of the INSS CEO, which provided the following information:  As a result of the administrative and structural reorganization of the institution, duly approved by the relevant authorities, the medical supervision area of the general health administration was completely closed down, changing the character from a supervisory function exercised by doctors to a function of social care carried out by social workers duly recruited by the institution'  () the measure adopted was based on article  of the Civil Service and Administrative Staff Act, Act No. , which states verbatim:  Institutional restructuring and reorganization. When programmes of institutional restructuring or reorganization give rise to the termination of staff or employees, the effects of the abolition shall be established in the corresponding human resources adjustment programmes or plans formulated by the Government and approved by the Governing Body concerning established rights of staff and employees under the present Act. Public servants affected by these programmes shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the present Act and the respective collective agreement'  () on  March  the contracts of employment of  medical supervisors were terminated (the names provided by the Government include almost all the trade union officials mentioned by the complainant organization); () on  March , the medical supervisors mentioned by the Government filed a claim for reinstatement and payment of wages due with the judicial authority and a decision in the case is still pending; () on  April , the dismissed workers Isabel Vanessa Rivera Ubeda (trade union official), Margarita del Carmen Snchez Mndez and Ercilia Elizabeth Aguilera Centena, withdrew their legal action; and () to date, the following dismissed workers, all former members of STEINSS have settled their claims: Isabel Vanessa Rivera Ubeda, Sergio Juan Ramn Quiroz, Karla Esperanza Saavedra, Moiss Ruiz Romero, Karla del Rosario Alvarado Paz, Ivette Pilarte Centeno and Frutos Jos Plazaola Cubillo.
.In this respect the Committee recalls that on numerous occasions it pointed out that it can examine allegations concerning economic rationalization programmes and restructuring processes, whether or not they imply redundancies or the transfer of enterprises or services from the public to the private sector, only in so far as they might have given rise to acts of discrimination or interference against trade unions. In any case, the Committee can only regret that in the rationalization and staff-reduction process, the government did not consult or try to reach an agreement with the trade union organizations and also the Committee has emphasized that it is important that governments consult with trade union organizations to discuss the consequences of restructuring programmes on the employment and working conditions of employees [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ]. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether STEINSS was consulted about the restructuring which took place and which according to the allegations prejudiced the trade union officials and members. In addition, observing that according to the Government, three workers withdrew their legal actions and seven settled their claims, the Committee, while noting that according to the Government the restructuring was carried out within the framework of the law, requests it to inform it of the result of the ongoing legal appeals relating to the remaining trade union officials and workers who were dismissed.The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel ' ENACAL-Estel
.As regards the allegation relating to the termination of the contract of employment of Mr Fidel Castillo Lago (Minutes Secretary), official of the  Genaro Lazo' Union and  members, the Committee notes that the Government reports that on  June  the trade union official in question filed a claim against the company which is still in progress. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial process initiated by the trade union official, Mr Fidel Castillo Lago, and",1,2007,Nicaragua
16,"to send its observations relating to the alleged dismissal of  members of the trade union.The Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Granada and the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Carazo
.With regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of eight officials of UTSO, nine officials of the Enacal Granada Workers' Departmental Democratic Union and five officials of the Enacal Carazo Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, the Committee notes that the Government reports that: () under decision No. - of the Inspectorate General of Labour of  May , it was established that the Inspectorate General of Labour was competent under articles  and  of the Labour Code to hear and decide the application by ENACAL which on  May  requested the Inspectorate to pronounce the illegality of the strike conducted by the workers of the Carazo and Granada departmental branches; () the reports of the special inspections carried out by the Inspectorate General of Labour in this matter showed that the workers of the Carazo and Granada branches had gone on strike without first exhausting the legal procedures, and had defaulted on their labour obligations by arbitrarily suspending their work, in relation to a claim of non-compliance with the collective agreement and the negotiation of a new list of demands; () irrespective of the reasons given by the workers of the ENACAL Carazo and Granada departmental branches for demanding improvements in their social and labour rights, these do not allow or legitimize them in holding a collective stoppage of work without respecting the procedures nor fulfilling the requirements clearly set out in the legislation; () faced with that situation, the Inspectorate General of Labour decided to allow the application by ENACAL for declaration of the strike as illegal and ordered the striking workers to return to work within  hours, failing which the employer might deem the contracts of employment of those who continue with the illegal act to be terminated; () the dismissal of the striking workers at ENACAL Granada and Carazo was not because they were trade unionists or exercising a trade union right (which right is protected by labour law), but for breach of labour legislation and the decision rendered by the Inspectorate General of Labour; () on  June , certain ENACAL (Granada) workers filed a claim for reinstatement in the District Civil and Industrial Court in the department of Granada; and () on  June , ENACAL (Carazo) workers filed a legal appeal in Jinotepe.
.In this respect, the Committee observes that the Government has not indicated with sufficient precision the legal requirements which the trade unions apparently failed to respect (confining itself to stating that the legal procedures had not been exhausted). Furthermore, the Committee emphasizes that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal should not lie with the government, but with an independent body which has the confidence of the parties involved [see Digest, op. cit. para. ].
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government: () to take measures, including of a legislative character if necessary, so that in future a body independent of the parties and in which they have confidence is responsible for declaring a strike illegal; () to inform it more precisely concerning the legal requirements that the organizations did not respect and which led to the strike being declared illegal and the subsequent dismissal of the trade union officials in order to be able to pronounce itself in full knowledge of the facts; and () to inform it of the result of the legal claims filed by certain ENACAL-Granada and ENACAL-Carazo workers.

In these circumstances, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of this allegation.Directorate-General of Revenues (DGI)
.As regards the allegation that the DGI signed a collective agreement with trade unions controlled by it, excluding other trade unions which were recognized by a collective agreement concluded in , and rejected a list of demands submitted by those unions, the Committee notes that the Government reports that on  August , the trade unions represented by the complainant organization asked to join the collective agreement concluded between the DGI, the SINTUR-DGI-UNE, the SINTRACAF-UNE and the SITRADGI and withdrew the list of demands submitted to the Ministry of Labour. The Committee also notes that the agreement was signed by all the trade union organizations mentioned by the complainant organization. In these circumstances, the Committee will not proceed with the examination of this allegation.
.With regard to the allegation that, in breach of national legislation on trade union rights, the DGI ordered the dismissal of Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos, spokesperson of the SEPGRA-DGI, the Committee notes that the Government reports that a decision in favour of the worker was given by the Inspectorate General of Labour on  January . In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it whether by virtue of the decision of the Inspectorate General of Labour, reported by the Government, the trade union official Ms Maura de Jess Vivas Ramos has been reinstated in her post with payment of wages due.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of ten officials and  members of STEINSS, the Committee requests the Government to inform it: () whether the union was consulted about the restructuring which took place in the Institute and which prejudiced the trade union officials and members; and () the result of the ongoing legal appeals relating to the dismissals of the trade union officials and members who did not withdraw their legal actions.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the result of the judicial process initiated by the trade union official, Mr Fidel Castillo Lago, Minutes Secretary of the  Genaro Lazo' Union of the Nicaraguan Aqueduct and Sewer Company of Estel ' ENACAL-Estel and to send its observations relating to the alleged dismissal of  other members.(c) With regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of eight officials of the UTSO, nine officials of the Enacal Granada Workers' Departmental Democratic Union and five officials of the Enacal Carazo Workers' Departmental Democratic Union, the Committee requests the Government: () to take measures, including of a legislative character if necessary, so that in future a body independent of the parties and in which they have confidence is responsible for declaring a strike illegal; () to inform it more precisely concerning the legal requirements that the organizations did not respect and which led to the strike being declared illegal and the subsequent dismissal of the trade union officials in order to be able to pronounce itself in full knowledge of the facts; and () to inform it of the result of the legal claims filed by certain ENACAL-Granada and ENACAL-Carazo workers.

18,".In its previous examination of the case at its March  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations on the questions still pending [see th Report, para. ]:In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of SEMTIAC, and while noting the Government s statement that the request before the First District Labour Court of Managua is awaiting the Court s ruling, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision that is handed down.(b) Concerning the alleged dismissal without respect for trade union immunity or legal process of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA DGTT MTI on  April , the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for terminating his contract and, in the event it is found that the dismissal as due to his legitimate trade union activities, to endeavour to have him reinstated.(c) With respect to the alleged transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, member of the Executive Committee of the SEMTIAC, the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for his transfer and, in the event it is found that the transfer was due to his exercise of trade union activities, to take steps to have him transferred back to his previous post.(d) As regards the alleged anti-union dismissal of Ms Perla Marina Corea Zamora, Secretary-General of the Independent Workers Trade Union of the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, Ms Yerigel Ziga Izaguirre, the union s finance secretary, Ms Lila Carolina Alvarado Muoz, first spokesperson of the watchdog unit of the SEMTIAC, Mr Freddy Antonio Velsquez Luna, Secretary-General of the SITRAMTI and Secretary-General of the FEDETRASEP, Mr Jorge Boanerges Cruz Berros, organization and information secretary of the SITRAMTI and spokesperson for the FEDETRASEP, Mr Byron Antonio Tercero Ramos, organization, records and agreements secretary of the SINTESESIP MTI and Mr Francisco Zamora Vivas, finance secretary of the SITRAMTI, and while noting the Government s statement that they had lodged appeals with the courts and that the appeals were awaiting the decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Committee expects that the judicial authority will shortly hand down its decision and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.(e) Relating the allegation that the current administration of the Ministry is infringing article  of the collective agreement in force concerning the resources that trade unions need to carry out their activities (computer with access to Internet, printer, office supplies, use of a vehicle, etc.) and that these facilities are made available only to a trade union that follows the party line, the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the matter and, in case of the veracity of the allegation, to take steps to bring the parties together and to ensure full compliance with the clauses of the collective agreement cited by the complainant organization..In its communication of  December , the Government states with regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern that his employment contract was terminated at the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) because he had occupied a position of trust at that institution. He lodged an appeal for constitutional protection (amparo) before the Managua Appeals Court. The court, in a ruling dated  June , decided that the appellant Mr Hernndez Caldern had not exhausted the available administrative channels and that therefore the application for amparo could not be admitted.
.In its communication of  December , the Government states with regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern that his employment contract was terminated at the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) because he had occupied a position of trust at that institution. He lodged an appeal for constitutional protection (amparo) before the Managua Appeals Court. The court, in a ruling dated  June , decided that the appellant Mr Hernndez Caldern had not exhausted the available administrative channels and that therefore the application for amparo could not be admitted.
.As regards the case of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, the Government states that he occupied a position of trust within the MTI as a department transport delegate in Nueva Segovia, and his employment contract was terminated on  April  in accordance with article  of Act No.  concerning the civil service and the administrative career path. Subsequently Mr Centeno received due payment of his final pay and social benefits, which was confirmed by a document dated  May .
.As regards Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, the Government states that Civil Chamber No.  of the Managua Appeals Court ruled on  January  that the appeal for amparo lodged by Mr Marcos Meja Lpez and others should be considered null and void.
.The Government also states that the Supreme Court of Justice did not hand down rulings in favour of Ms Perla Marina Corea Zamora, Ms Yerigel Ziga Izaguirre, Ms Lila Carolina Alvarado Muoz, Mr Freddy Antonio Velsquez Luna, Mr Jorge Boanerges Cruz Berros, Mr Byron Antonio Tercero Ramos and Mr Francisco Jos Zamora.
.As regards the violation of clause  of the collective agreement between the MTI and a number of trade unions of the same institution, the Government states that the Ministry has seven trade union organizations, namely: the Trade Union of Workers of MTI (SITRAMTI); Trade Union of Democratic Workers (SITRAD); Trade Union of Public Service Workers of the MTI (SINTESIP MTI); Trade Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC); National Trade Union of the SINATRA DGTT MTI; Independent Trade Union of Workers of MTI; and National  Heroes and Martyrs' Trade Union of MTI UNE STI. The Ministry has stated that its budget is not sufficient to satisfy the demands of all the trade unions mentioned, and the modest resources available to it are therefore distributed in a rational manner among the trade unions in question.
.The Government also indicates that the collective agreement previously referred to was extended on  June .
.The Committee notes that for reasons of form or substance the judicial authority has not given rulings in favour of the trade unionists named in its previous recommendations (a), (c) and (d). The Committee will therefore not pursue its examination of these questions unless the complainant organization presents new information, which establishes a breach of Conventions Nos  and . The Committee also notes that, as regards recommendation (b), the Government states that Mr Jos Mara Centeno occupied a position of trust and his employment contract was terminated in accordance with legislation, and that he received final payment of the statutory benefits to which he was entitled.
.As regards the alleged failure to implement article  of the collective agreement in force (concerning trade union facilities such as computers, printers and so on) by the MTI, the Committee notes the Government s statement to the effect that its budget is not sufficient to satisfy all the demands of the seven trade unions that operate at the Ministry. The Committee recalls that collective agreements must be respected by the parties to them, especially when, as the Government has stated, the MTI collective agreement has been extended.
.The Committee examined this case at its May June  session, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session].
.The Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) presented new allegations in a communication dated  March .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.The Committee notes that the Government has sent its observations on pending issues and on the new allegations presented by the complainant organization.
.With regard to the alleged disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  between the workers and authorities of the MTI relating to the recognition by way of a salary adjustment of the equivalent of  additional hours per month for all the drivers, the Committee had noted that the MTI and the trade union organizations concerned had agreed to extend the validity of the collective agreement in the MTI and expected that the matter would be the object of future negotiations if it had not been dealt with yet in the collective agreement in force. The Committee notes the Government s statement that: () on  July  a collective agreement was signed between workers' organizations and the MTI, clause  of which stipulates that additional hours are paid to workers when so authorized by their immediate chief, payable in the first week of the month after they have occurred, and clause  of which establishes that the undertaking pays all workers every year a bonus based on the average number of additional hours that were due for the three previous months, irrespective of their entitlement to an end-of-year bonus; and ()",1,2007,Nicaragua
19,"the collective agreement thus rendered null and void the terms established unilaterally in the memorandum. The Committee takes note of this information with interest.
.Concerning the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the SEMTIAC on  May , the Committee had urged the Government to implement the administrative resolutions and to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that the dismissed union official was reinstated in his post, with payment of outstanding wages and other benefits. The Committee notes the Government s statement that the request submitted by the union official on  May  is currently before the First District Labour Court of Managua, where it is awaiting the Court s ruling, and that the Government will in due course inform the Committee of the decision taken by the Court. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision handed down in this regard.
.With respect to the alleged persecution and harassment in order to later proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA DGTT MTI, the Committee had requested the Government to keep it informed of any legal appeal that the union official, Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, might have presented against the resolution of the General Labour Inspectorate. The Committee notes the Government s statement that, in a decision rendered on  January , the Civil Chamber No.  of the Court of Appeals of the constituency of Managua declared that his appeal for legal protection was irreceivable and dismissed the case. In the light of this information and the fact that the complainant organization has not commented on the dismissal of the case, the Committee will not pursue its examination of these allegations any further.
.As regards the alleged request to cancel the contract of employment of union official Javier Ruiz lvarez, the Committee had requested the Government to provide information on the specific reasons behind that request and to keep it informed of the final outcome of the proceedings before the Departmental Labour Inspectorate. The Committee notes the Government s statement that Mr Ruiz lvarez withdrew the appeal that he had lodged with the courts. The Committee takes note with interest that he is currently working at the MTI in the General Directorate of Water Transport.
.Relating to the alleged dismissal without respect for trade union immunity or legal process of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA DGTT MTI on  April , the Committee notes the Government s statement that the MTI had informed it that Mr Centeno s contract, which was for a position of trust, had been terminated in accordance with article  of the Civil Service and Administrative Career Act. While the Committee appreciates that workers in positions of trust can be freely appointed and removed, it observes that the Government does not deny that Mr Centeno held a trade union post and recalls the following:  One of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee calls upon the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for terminating the contract of union official Mr Centeno and, in the event it is found that it was due to his legitimate trade union activities, to endeavour to have him reinstated.
.With regard to the alleged transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, member of the Executive Committee of SEMTIAC, the Committee notes the Government s statement that Mr Meja Lpez had lodged an appeal for legal protection against alleged threats of dismissal with Civil Chamber No.  of the Court of Appeals of the constituency of Managua but that since he did not appear in court to ratify his appeal, it was decided to treat the matter as if the appeal had not been lodged. The Committee observes that the Government does not deny that union official Mr Meja Lpez was transferred, and calls on it to take the necessary measures to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for his transfer and, in the event it is found that the transfer was due to his exercise of trade union activities, to ensure that he is transferred back to his previous post.
.Concerning the alleged workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, secretary for labour affairs of the SEMTIAC, who is said to have been dismissed on  May  and reinstated the same day and to be again at risk of dismissal, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the union official had lodged an appeal for legal protection with the judicial authorities and that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, in ruling on the matter, found that, far from receiving threats of dismissal, the complainant had been encouraged by the institution to take part in trade union events abroad and had eventually dismissed the appeal. In the light of this information, the Committee will not pursue the examination of this allegation any further.
.With respect to the alleged anti-union dismissals of Ms Perla Marina Corea Zamora, Secretary-General of the Independent Workers Trade Union of the MTI, Ms Yerigel Ziga Izaguirre, the same union s finance secretary, Ms Lila Carolina Alvarado Muoz, first spokesperson of the watchdog unit of the SEMTIAC, Mr Freddy Antonio Velsquez Luna, Secretary-General of the SITRAMTI and Secretary-General of FEDETRASEP, Mr Jorge Boanerges Cruz Berros, organization and information secretary of SITRAMTI and spokesperson for the FEDETRASEP, Mr Byron Antonio Tercero Ramos, organization, records and agreements secretary of SINTESESIP MTI and Mr Francisco Zamora Vivas, finance secretary of the SITRAMTI, the Committee notes the Government s statement that they had lodged appeals which were awaiting the decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. The Committee expects that the judicial authority will shortly hand down its decision and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.
.Finally, as regards the allegation that the current administration of the MTI is infringing article  of the collective agreement in force concerning the resources that trade unions need to carry out their activities (computer with access to Internet, printer, office supplies, use of a vehicle, etc.) and that these facilities are made available only to a trade union that follows the party line, the Committee recalls that  agreements should be binding on the parties' [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and notes that both the authorities and the employers must avoid any form of discrimination among trade union organizations that have signed the same collective agreement. That being so, the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the matter and, should it find the allegation to be true, to take steps to bring the parties together and ensure full compliance with the clauses of the collective agreement cited by the complainant organization.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of SEMTIAC, and while noting the Government s statement that the request before the First District Labour Court of Managua is awaiting the Court s ruling, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the decision that is handed down.(b) Concerning to the alleged dismissal without respect for trade union immunity or legal process of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA DGTT MTI on  April , the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for terminating his contract and, in the event it is found that the dismissal as due to his legitimate trade union activities, to endeavour to have him reinstated.(c) With respect to the alleged transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, member of the Executive Committee of the SEMTIAC, the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the reasons for his transfer and, in the event it is found that the transfer was due to his exercise of trade union activities, to take steps to have him transferred back to his previous post.(d) As regards the alleged anti-union dismissal of Ms Perla Marina Corea Zamora, Secretary-General of the Independent Workers Trade Union",1,2007,Nicaragua
20,"of the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, Ms Yerigel Ziga Izaguirre, the union s finance secretary, Ms Lila Carolina Alvarado Muoz, first spokesperson of the watchdog unit of the SEMTIAC, Mr Freddy Antonio Velsquez Luna, Secretary-General of the SITRAMTI and SecretaryGeneral of the FEDETRASEP, Mr Jorge Boanerges Cruz Berros, organization and information secretary of the SITRAMTI and spokesperson for the FEDETRASEP, Mr Byron Antonio Tercero Ramos, organization, records and agreements secretary of the SINTESESIP MTI and Mr Francisco Zamora Vivas, finance secretary of the SITRAMTI, and while noting the Government s statement that they had lodged appeals with the courts and that the appeals were awaiting the decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Committee expects that the judicial authority will shortly hand down its decision and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.(e) Relating the allegation that the current administration of the Ministry is infringing article  of the collective agreement in force concerning the resources that trade unions need to carry out their activities (computer with access to Internet, printer, office supplies, use of a vehicle, etc.) and that these facilities are made available only to a trade union that follows the party line, the Committee calls on the Government to conduct an inquiry into the matter and, in case of the veracity of the allegation, to take steps to bring the parties together and to ensure full compliance with the clauses of the collective agreement cited by the complainant organization.
.The Committee examined this case at its May June  session and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (June )].
.The Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) submitted new allegations and additional information in a communication dated  February .
.At its March  session, the Committee observed that, despite the time that had elapsed since the previous examination of the case, it had not received the information that had been requested of the Government. The Committee issued an urgent appeal to the Government drawing its attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting if the requested observations had not been received in full and in due time. Accordingly, it urged the Government to send its observations as a matter of urgency [see rd Report, para. ].
.Since then, the Committee has not received the information requested of the Government concerning this case.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its June  session, the Committee made the following recommendations on the matters that remained pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) With regard to the alleged disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  between workers and the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure with regard to the recognition by way of a salary adjustment of the equivalent of  additional hours per month for all the drivers, the Committee, while noting that the MTI and the trade union organizations concerned agreed to extend the validity of the collective agreement in the MTI, expects that this matter will be the object of future negotiations if it has not been dealt with yet in the current collective agreement.(b) With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) on  May , the Committee urges the Government to implement the administrative resolutions and to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that the dismissed union official is reinstated in his post, with payment of outstanding wages and other benefits. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(c) With regard to the alleged persecution and harassment in order to later on proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal appeal that the union official, Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, may have presented against the resolution of the General Labour Inspectorate.(d) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the specific reasons behind the request to cancel the employment contract of the union official, Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, and to inform it of the final outcome of the proceedings before the Departmental Labour Inspectorate.(e) The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations with regard to the following allegations: (i) dismissal, without respect for trade union immunity or legal process, of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI on  April ; (ii) transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MIT  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC); and (iii) workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, Secretary for Labour Matters of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) ' he was dismissed on  May  and reinstated the same day and is currently again at risk of dismissal.
.In its communication of  February , the CUS alleges that the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure has not yet complied with the requests to hold a meeting with the trade unions representing all the workers at that Ministry, even though this request has been made since January . The CUS adds that the Government has still not complied with the recommendations made by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its session in May June  and has not yet complied with many of the clauses of the collective agreement, including with regard to recruitment, dismissal procedures and union facilities (offices, etc.), or the drivers' bilateral agreement, in particular with regard to the salary adjustment.
.The CUS adds that the decision to dismiss union official Alvaro Leiva Snchez was overturned by the Director of Human Resources in May , on the grounds that it had been an error, but his job is currently again in imminent danger as a result of the preparation of a memorandum which falsely states that it had been necessary to issue warnings to the individual in question, questions the image that he presents of the institution and accuses him, on the basis of pure unsubstantiated speculation, of removing documents from the Assistance Desk Unit; this is clearly a case of harassment. Finally, on  September , he was suspended from work.
.The CUS also alleges that the union official Ms Perla Corea Zamora started to be subjected to sexual harassment and work pressure from her immediate supervisor, and two months later, on  March , not having given in to the demands of her supervisor, she was suspended from work, pending her dismissal; although the Civil Service Appeals Committee stated that the dismissal was not appropriate and ordered that her rights be restored, the Ministry has appealed to a court against this decision; the unionist in question has filed amparo proceedings (protection of constitutional rights).
.According to the allegations, the Ministry of Transport has illegally suspended the duties of trade union official Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez (this allegation was discussed in the previous examination of the case); although it is clear ' according to the complainant organization in its latest communication ' that he was absent from work due to illness, a claim that is substantiated by an official certificate, the Ministry of Transport refuses to take into account the decision of the Labour Inspectorate in favour of this unionist. Likewise, it is alleged that after dismissing union official Mr Guillermo Rafael Gonzlez, the Ministry wants to liquidate his benefits without taking into account the fact that the injured party has filed amparo proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice.
.According to the allegations, the Ministry has transferred unionist Ms Tania Castillo Centeno, in violation of the legal procedural rules.
.Furthermore, it is alleged that in the context of a special hearing, without legal grounds, the trade union official Ms Yerigel Ziga Izaguirre was suspended from work and subsequently dismissed. This dismissal decision was suspended pending an appeal, which the Ministry refuses to accept.
.The complainant organization indicates that, in early January , the unions exercised their right to strike on the grounds of the violation of the current collective agreement, and that the Ministry of Labour ruled that the union complaint was admissible (a decision which was ignored by the Ministry of Transport). Later, the Ministry of Labour ' under the guidance of the Executive Branch ' declared the strike illegal and arbitrary on  January . The unions filed amparo proceedings.
.According to the allegations, on  July , union member Nelson Antonio Martnez was illegally suspended from work for allegedly committing gross misconduct for having participated in a protest by",-1,2007,Nicaragua
21,"workers in January  against the Ministry of Transport s failure to comply with the collective agreement. The Civil Service Appeals Committee declared the disciplinary proceedings invalid, but nevertheless the Ministry did not comply with this decision, and the injured party had to file an appeal, which was found to be admissible; nevertheless, the Ministry has not complied with this legal decision.
.According to the allegations, the Ministry of Transport has suspended union officials Mr Freddy Antonio Velzquez Luna, Mr Jos Boanerges Cruz Berrios, Mr Byron Antonio Tercero Ramos and Mr Francisco Zamora Viva from work (with a request to cancel their employment contracts) for opposing the construction of a concrete wall blocking the emergency exits in the western part of the Ministry; furthermore, it reported them to the police for allegedly causing criminal damage; in fact, blocking the exits put the lives and safety of workers at risk. The injured parties have lodged an appeal which resulted in the charges being set aside and the Civil Service Appeals Committee declared the acts of the Ministry of Transport to be invalid. However, the Ministry has not complied with the aforementioned decisions.
.Finally, the complainant organization points out that, on the basis of a report by the Labour Inspectorate dated  September  indicating that the Ministry of Transport complies with only  per cent of the collective agreement, union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez has filed a criminal complaint with the Office of the Public Prosecutor against the Minister of Transport and other senior officials at the Ministry for the crimes of  abuse of authority' and  disobedience by a public servant to official authority' 
.The Committee regrets that, despite the time that has elapsed, the Government has not sent the requested observations, although it has been invited on several occasions, including by means of an urgent appeal, to present its observations on the case.
.Under these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session], the Committee is bound to present a report on the substance of the case without the benefit of the information which it had hoped to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure established by the International Labour Organization for the examination of allegations of violations of freedom of association is to promote respect for this freedom, in law and in practice. The Committee remains confident that, if the procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, governments, on their side, must recognize the importance of formulating, so as to allow objective examination, detailed replies to the allegations brought against them.
.The Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future with regard to the Committee s procedural rules especially in the present case as the complainant organization has submitted a long list of allegations concerning violations of trade union rights, the importance of which is unquestionable.
.The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant had alleged that with a view to destroying and getting rid of the trade unions that are not in agreement with the ideas of the present Government, trade union officials have been dismissed and collective agreements or accords are being broken. Specifically, the complainant alleged: (i) disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  between the authorities and workers at the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) regarding the recognition by way of a salary adjustment, the equivalent of  extra hours per month for all the drivers; (ii) violation of numerous clauses of the current collective agreement by the MTI (regarding among other things the use of vehicles assigned to the trade unions on weekends, the use of the premises by the General Secretary of the Independent Trade Union of the MTI and of the auditorium used by this trade union for holding its meetings, etc.); (iii) dismissals, without respect for trade union immunity or legal process, of Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI on  April , and of Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) on  May ; (iv) workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, Secretary for Labour Matters of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) ' he was dismissed on  May  and reinstated the same day and is currently again at risk of dismissal; (v) the transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC); (vi) suspension from work of Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, publications and press secretary of the Independent Union of Workers of the MTI; and (vii) persecution and harassment in order later on to proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI.
.The Committee notes the new allegations of the complainant organization, indicating that the Government has ignored the Committee s recommendations and that the authorities of the Ministry of Transport continue to violate the terms of the collective agreement ( per cent of the clauses, according to the labour inspectorate) and ignore the judicial and administrative decisions in favour of the union officials and members. In its new allegations, the complainant organization refers to cases concerning the suspension and dismissal of union officials and unionists and to the Ministry of Labour s refusal to comply with administrative or judicial decisions in favour of those unionists. According to the allegations, the Minister of Transport continues to refuse to accept the leaders of the unions that operate in the Ministry. The Committee urges the Government to send without delay detailed observations on these new allegations by the complainant organization, also including copies of the administrative and judicial decisions concerning the different allegations.
.In the absence of observations by the Government on the recommendations made by the Committee during its previous examination of the case, and bearing in mind the new allegations, the Committee notes a serious deterioration in industrial relations at the Ministry of Transport, a negative attitude towards dialogue among the authorities in the Ministry of Transport, a significant number of acts of anti-union discrimination and an unwillingness among the authorities of the Ministry to comply with the terms of the collective agreement.
.The Committee urges the Government to promote dialogue and negotiation between the Ministry of Transport and the trade unions to overcome the various problems raised in this case ' including compliance with the current collective agreement and the bipartite agreement on wage adjustment. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it necessary to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations that should cover ' with particular attention ' the alleged failure by the Ministry of Transport to comply with judicial and administrative decisions and judgements in favour of the unionists. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee emphasizes that excessive litigation in labour matters is in the interests neither of the employer nor of the union.
.Finally, in the absence of any reply from the Government concerning the recommendations it made in May June , the Committee reiterates the recommendations it made at that time.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee stresses the importance of the allegations and regrets that the Government has not sent its observations on this case despite having been invited to do so on several occasions and despite an urgent appeal in that respect; the Committee urges the Government to be more cooperative in the future with regard to its procedural rules.(b) The Committee urges the Government to promote dialogue and negotiation between the Ministry of Transport and the trade unions in order to overcome the various problems that have been raised in this case ' including with regard to compliance with the current collective agreement and the bipartite agreement on wage adjustment. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it necessary to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations that should cover ' with particular attention ' the alleged failure by the Ministry of Transport to comply with the judicial and administrative decisions and judgements in favour of the unionists.(c) The Committee urges the Government to send without delay detailed observations on the new allegations by the complainant organization, also including copies of the administrative and judicial decisions concerning the different allegations.(d) Finally, in the absence of any reply from the Government concerning the recommendations it made in May June , the Committee reiterates the recommendations it made at that time:' With regard to the alleged disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  between workers and the Ministry of Transport",1,2007,Nicaragua
22,"and Infrastructure with regard to the recognition by way of a salary adjustment of the equivalent of  additional hours per month for all the drivers, the Committee, while noting that the MTI and the trade union organizations concerned agreed to extend the validity of the collective agreement in the MTI, expects that this matter will be the object of future negotiations if it has not been dealt with yet in the current collective agreement.' With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) on  May , the Committee urges the Government to implement the administrative resolutions and to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that the dismissed union official is reinstated in his post, with payment of outstanding wages and other benefits. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.' With regard to the alleged persecution and harassment in order to later on proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal appeal that the union official, Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, may have presented against the resolution of the General Labour Inspectorate.' The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the specific reasons behind the request to cancel the employment contract of the union official, Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, and to inform it of the final outcome of the proceedings before the Departmental Labour Inspectorate.' The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations with regard to the following allegations: (i) dismissal, without respect for trade union immunity or legal process, of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI on  April ; (ii) transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC); and (iii) workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, Secretary for Labour Matters of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) ' he was dismissed on  May and reinstated the same day and is currently again at risk of dismissal.
.This complaint is contained in a communication dated  September .
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January and  April .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) states that after winning the elections and upon taking office on  January , the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua began appointing all its civil servants in the various ministries, decentralized entities and state enterprises. It notes that in the Republic of Nicaragua, prior to this, the Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act and its Regulations had been approved, with a view to avoiding massive dismissals of public servants, guaranteeing in that law the collective agreement and freedom of association. Freedom of association and collective bargaining are guaranteed in the National Constitution, in the Labour Code, in the Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act, etc.
.Following the appointment of all the Ministers of State and directors of public bodies, the new Government has gone out of its way to disrupt, destroy and get rid of the trade unions that are not in agreement with its ideas; trade union officials have been dismissed ' even though they have trade union immunity ' without just cause; in addition, the collective agreements are being completely distorted and broken. In view of the breaks in the collective agreement and the dismissal of workers, including trade union leaders, these acts have been reported in the media and workers were starting to come forward with particular complaints. At the same time, a case was being prepared before the Ministry of Labour in defence of these rights. Specifically, the Democratic Federation of Public Service Workers (FEDETRASEP) took the decision to report the violation of freedom of association, because in addition to being public servants, they are members of the Executive Committee of the union, and run the risk of being dismissed like other members of the executive committee.
.The complainant indicates that since  January , the trade unions representing all the workers at the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI), in an effort to achieve a good employment relationship, have requested a meeting with the Minister to address labour matters of interest to the institution and the rights of workers and to thereby comply with clause No.  on mutual recognition and respect. Everything in this regard is established in the current collective agreement signed by the management and the trade unions of the MTI on  July  and in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua, Act No. , the Labour Code, Act No. , Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act, and the collective agreement negotiated by both parties at the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation of the Ministry of Labour. However, according to the CUS, what the workers at the MTI have got from the current administration, is a series of violations of laws and standards contained in the current collective agreement, national legislation and the ILO Conventions signed by Nicaragua.
.The CUS adds that the above is proven by the fact that the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  by workers at the MTI, represented by the trade unions, and the management of the institution has been disregarded and suspended. This bilateral agreement was to recognize by way of a salary adjustment, the equivalent of  extra hours per month for all the institution s drivers, something that has been recognized since . Disregarding and suspending this bilateral agreement, which had become an acquired right for the Ministry s drivers, greatly affects the household income of more than  drivers, reducing by more than  per cent the salary that the management interprets as overtime and not as a salary adjustment.
.The complainants say that article  of Act No.   Acquired Labour Rights Act' states that:  In the application and interpretation of the present Act,  cquired labour rights' are understood to be the collection of benefits, powers, standards of protection and similar provisions that are established in favour of workers in the Political Constitution, labour legislation, international labour conventions, ministerial regulations or decrees, collective agreements and bilateral agreements between employers and employees'  Article  of the same Act states that:  In accordance with the provisions of article  and by virtue of this present law, all the rights established for workers, in accordance with the provisions of the Political Constitution, the Labour Code, labour legislation, special laws, ministerial regulations, collective agreements or accords, are considered as acquired labour rights definitively, for their beneficiaries and those involved in the collective agreements or individual labour contracts or legal employment relationship' 
.The CUS affirms that, customarily and in the way that this salary adjustment has been paid, even the management recognizes it as they have used it as a reference for the deduction of food embargos, bank deductions, the Christmas bonus and advances to duly confirmed salaries reflecting that these extra hours have been considered as a salary adjustment and not as overtime. The salary adjustment contained in the MTI drivers' bilateral agreement is definitively an acquired labour right, and as such forms part of the collective agreement or the individual labour contract or the legal employment relationship.
.The complainant alleges that, on  January , the trade unions of the MTI received a communication from the Financial Administration Directorate indicating that, on the orders of the senior management and without exception, the vehicles assigned to the trade unions should remain parked at the MTI buildings from Friday and throughout the whole weekend, during which time they would be guarded by the security patrol until the start of work on Monday, and adding that they would carry out a special check and if this order was disobeyed a report would be sent so that the necessary corrective measures could be taken. According to the CUS, this order violates clause No.  of the current collective agreement. As well as breaking this acquired right reflected in clause No.  of the current collective agreement, it also breaks article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua, Act No.  on Acquired Labour Rights, article  of the Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act and article , paragraph (o) of Act No.  of the Labour Code, because the trade unions need to have access to means of transport on weekends and without any restriction in order to be able to cover all labour social needs of all members of the unions in seminars, labour congresses, precautionary transfers to hospitals or",1,2007,Nicaragua
23,"clinics in cases of illness, accidents and funeral arrangements upon the death of employees.
.The complainant notes that the highest authority of the Ministry has stated that it will eliminate this acquired right of the workers, claiming that what is indicated in clause No.  of the collective agreement is expressed in singular form and not plural form and it should be interpreted as only one vehicle, only one fuel allowance, as well as one office, one computer with internet access, one printer, stationery, one office supply, one chair, one desk, one telephone with outside line, one air conditioning unit, one dry-wipe board, one metal filing cabinet, as well as the supply of one coffeepot, one cup, sugar, coffee, biscuits for the seven legally formed unions representing more than  per cent of the workers at the MTI. They add that this threat has been carried out as the institution s transport office was instructed to take these vehicles away from the trade unions.
.The complainant notes that the following statement can be read in a declaration by the Ministry Publisher in El Nuevo Diario on  February :  There are staff members who are being protected within the board of directors of trade unions and who are on the list of high salaries.' The complainant understands this to show their intention to violate clause No.  of the current collective agreement which stipulates that:  The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure will respect the trade union immunity of all members of the boards of directors of the existing trade unions and their duly elected section representatives in each of the directorates and delegations of the institution, as established by the Labour Code in section XI, articles , , ,  and article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua and the Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act and its Regulations. Were the MTI to dismiss a member of the executive committee or the branch committee, they should convoke the bipartite committee established in clause No.  of the collective agreement, to hear and decide on the case; were there to be no agreements, the issue would be forwarded to the Ministry of Labour, in accordance with the provisions of section XI of the Labour Code, for those workers who enjoy trade union immunity' 
.According to the complainant, this public declaration shows their intention not to comply with this clause. Moreover, they spoke to trade unions at a labour committee of the absolute willingness of the administration to dismiss employees who were members of the executive committees of unions and had trade union immunity. The complainant notes the case of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the National Union of Workers of the DGTTMTI (SINATRA-DGTT-MTI), dismissed on  April , and that of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, Secretary of Promotion and Advertising of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC), dismissed on  May . Though they were protected by trade union immunity, these two workers and trade union members were dismissed illegally and without any procedure, thereby violating the provisions of articles , ,  of Act No.   Labour Code'  articles  and  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua; articles  and  of Decree No. -  Regulations of Trade Union Associations'  clauses  and  of the current collective agreement (of the MTI); article , points , , ; and articles  and  of Act No.   Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act'  Added to this, on Friday,  May , Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, who was working as the Secretary for Labour Matters on the Board of Directors of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) and as the Secretary for Labour Matters on the Executive Committee of the Democratic Federation of Public Service Workers (FEDETRASEP) and had trade union immunity, was dismissed without just cause and without due process. This illegal dismissal was revoked by Mr Gustavo Guzmn Guilln, at around  p.m. that same day,  May , claiming that it had been an error.
.The complainant states that the aforementioned union official (Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez) is currently in imminent danger of being dismissed. He currently holds the position of head of the subdirectorate of the unit of the Assistance Desk of the MTI, a role which he holds as a result of his own ability and merits. The CUS alleges that on  May , Mr Leiva received from the Secretary-General of the MTI memorandum MTI/DM/PFME/// signed and sealed by the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure and addressed to all the general and specific directors of the MTI, which expressly stated that:  As of this day Mr Wilber Andino is appointed interim director of the unit of the Assistance Desk because this division requires leadership that is concerned with the good image of the institution and a series of situations have arisen over the past several months in which I have had to reprimand the current head of the area Mr Alvaro Leiva'  The complainant affirms that the information in memorandum MTI/DM/PFME/// of  May  from the MTI is false since when Mr Leiva was acting as interim director responsible for the unit of the Assistance Desk for more than five months his actions were at all times in accordance with the legal and administrative standards of the MTI and he never received a written reprimand from the MTI for any failing contained in article  of Act No.   Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act' and the Labour Code. The memorandum implies the unjust and discriminatory treatment of Mr Leiva for the simple reason of being a union official. The removal of Mr Alvaro Leiva from his post as interim director responsible for the unit of the Assistance Desk of the MTI without just cause violates his role as reported and expressed in the Manual of Posts and Functions written by the Directorate of Human Resources of the MTI and the Directorate General of Public Service of the Ministry of the Treasury and Public Credit which states in section , subsection .:  Take responsibility for the Assistance Desk in the absence of an immediate superior'  among other legislative provisions. It is evident that workplace harassment is being promoted against the union official Alvaro Leiva by the interim director of the Public Relations centre on direct instructions from the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure and the Secretary-General of the MTI.
.The complainants allege that the MTI was aware of and ignored the actions of its Director General of Aquatic Transport with regard to the illegal and arbitrary expulsion of the general secretary of the Independent Trade Union of the MTI from the office that she had worked in for more than five years with a view to using it for the new Subdirector of Aquatic Transport. In the same way, the Director-General of Land Transport failed to act against the illegal and arbitrary expulsion of the Union of Democratic Workers of the MTI from the auditorium that it used for holding its trade union meetings in order to use it for the Subdirector of Land Transport. The complainant adds that, a notification was also made regarding a transfer of responsibilities, against his will, to the inspector of land transport, Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, who is a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) and has trade union immunity, all with a view to making him appear as excess staff and later proceed to his dismissal. In addition, they allege the illegal suspension from work duties for reason of being under investigation of the union official and aquatic inspector Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, by the Director of Human Resources of the MTI and the Director-General of Aquatic Transport. Inspector Ruiz missed work for reasons of illness, and subsisted during his absence on the legal sickness benefit provided by the Nicaraguan Institute of Social Security (INSS). This was not taken into account, so that during his absence and without due process, a bipartite committee was set up to dismiss him without considering his trade union immunity as he is the publications and press secretary of the Independent Union of Workers of the MTI.
.The CUS also alleges persecution and workplace harassment in order to proceed later to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI, with trade union immunity. In this case, the administration of the MTI used illegal and disloyal practices and acted in bad faith by forcing the various licensees of land transport with conflicting routes to submit complaints against him, without considerating that both the itineraries and the routes had already been authorized by a competent higher authority in the previous administration, before he took on the role of Delegate of Land Transport in Managua. This violates national legislation.

24,"complainant indicates that the MTI has violated the current collective agreement of the MTI in respect of clause No.  on mutual recognition and respect; clause No.  on scope of application; clause No.  on labour stability; clause No.  on trade union training; clause No.  on time bank for trade union activity; clause No.  right of workers; clause No.  on duties of the employer; clause No.  on trade union premises and facilities; clause No.  on trade union immunity; clause No.  on the bipartite committee; clause No.  on the promotions and vacancies committee; clause No.  on occupational health and safety; clause No.  on social benefits committee; clause No.  on the attention of security guards (CPF); clause No.  on incentives and rewards; clause No.  on technical training; clause No.  on medical attention; clause No.  on payment for food; clause No.  on transport subsidy; clause No.  on travelling expenses; clause No.  on extra hours; clause No.  on uniforms; clause No.  on salary advances; clause No.  on salary revision committee; clause No.  on renewal of licences and insurance; clause No.  on school voucher; clause No.  on sporting, educational and cultural activities; clause No.  on employee identity card; and clause No.  on printing the agreement.
.The CUS reports that as they are in imminent danger of being dismissed and in light of the violations of the employment and constitutional rights of trade unions, they proceeded to lodge an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) with the Court of Appeal, civil chamber No. , Managua district and the cases have not yet been resolved (Nos / and /). In this regard, the complainant notes that it feels aggrieved because justice has been delayed from ruling. The only ruling that the Court of Appeal, civil chamber No. , Managua district, has given is in Case No. / where the appeal for amparo was not granted, although ample proof had been provided for the violations of constitutional rights. Lastly, the complainant adds that the authorities of the MTI have ignored the administrative resolutions from the Ministry of Labour and legal bodies in favour of union officials and workers at the institution with regard to reinstatements and compliance with the current collective agreement of the MTI, thereby violating the provisions of article  of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government states that the cases of the trade union officials are being heard at the wish of the parties, some through the administrative channels before the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, and others in labour tribunals, in accordance with procedures or processes established in law for conflicting parties. The Government adds that it requested information from the High Directorate of the MTI on the matter, and they reported the following:' the administration of the MTI pays for extra hours worked as established in law;' with regard to the violation of the collective agreement, this was denounced to the Ministry of Labour because upon assuming responsibility for the MTI it was found to be in an economically precarious situation. Denouncing the collective agreement is a right established in labour legislation for both signing parties of an agreement. Denouncing it has resulted in new negotiations in light of the current situation of the institution; the fact of denouncing the agreement does not in any way mean it has been violated, nor that any trade union rights have been violated. At this time, they are in a process of negotiation as indicated in the Labour Code. In its communication of  April , the Government indicates that the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) and the trade union organizations UNE-STI, CEN-UNE, SITRAD-MTI, SI-MTI, SITRA-MTI, SEMTIAC, SINATRA-DGTT-MTI, CEN-UNE and CUS signed an agreement which included the extension of the validity of the collective agreement for the period January  to July ;' with regard to the dismissal of union officials, the Labour Code establishes the obligations of workers as well as of employers (articles  and ) and if a worker or union official does not comply with their employment obligations, in accordance with that legislation, they can be dismissed following the procedures established in law.
.The Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate communicated the following information about the case:' with regard to the disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement established in a memorandum on  March  between various trade unions and the former administration of the MTI (the memorandum in question stipulates that drivers will be paid an amount equivalent to  extra hours each month), the Labour Inspectorate handed down Resolution No. -, ruling on the complaint lodged by Mr Roger Eduardo Martnez Domnguez and others, against the administration of the MTI for violation of their acquired labour rights. It was considered that the claimants did not prove that a right laid down in any legal standard contained in articles  and  of Act No.  had been broken, nor did they show that they had at any time received the additional salary payment which, according to the workers, had been authorized at the time by the Minister in charge of that institution by signing the  memorandum' document. The General Labour Inspector considered that the contents of that document, and the fact that it was signed by the Minister at the time, does not make it a vested labour right, because a memorandum cannot be, and is not, a document that generates rights or obligations. As a result, she upheld the decision handed down by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate for the Agriculture, Farming and Industry Sector, at  p.m. on  February ;' with regard to Mr Javier Adolfo Ruiz Alvarez, there are two different situations. Firstly, the General Labour Inspectorate handed down the ruling of . a.m. on  June , rejecting the request for authorization to cancel the employment contract of Mr Ruiz Alvarez, in his capacity as a union official, brought by the MTI, for not complying with the concluding part of article  of the Labour Code. Later, in another case, the General Labour Inspectorate, in Resolution No. -, decided to overrule the appeal lodged by Mr Javier Adolfo Ruiz Alvarez in his capacity as a worker, who holds the post of publications and press secretary of the board of directors of the Independent Union of Workers of the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, against the ruling of the Departmental Local Labour Inspectorate One of  June , wholly upholding the ruling appealed by Mr Ruiz Alvarez. The following legal considerations are worth mentioning here: that Mr Ruiz Alvarez was suspended from work by the MTI until the ruling of the Tripartite Committee (which is hearing the specific case of Mr Ruiz Alvarez); it emerges from this situation that suspension with salary is not a violation of trade union immunity, as it was verified through a special inspection report that Mr Ruiz Alvarez s ordinary payroll salary was not withheld and that he was physically present at the institution, but without defined functions. As a result, the General Labour Inspectorate considers that the worker was not sanctioned and that it was a provisional decision of the employer while awaiting a ruling on his dismissal, which has been submitted for the consideration of the Ministry of Labour. Therefore, the existence of a request to cancel the employment contract in the Departmental Labour Inspectorate is not a violation of trade union immunity, in so far as the action of the employer is linked to the legal provisions on labour matters, on the basis of which the employee has the right to appeal the measure within  days following his knowledge of it, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code;' with regard to the case of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, the General Labour Inspectorate ruled in the second instance on the appeal lodged by the Minister of the MTI, who expressed the grievances caused by the resolution of the Departmental Labour Inspectorate One, on  May , alleging that the dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern was a result of a reengineering of all the posts occupied by employees that were not matched to their abilities and which represented an exorbitant cost to the State. It considered that the MTI does not have the authority to unilaterally carry out reorganization or reengineering, because article  of Act No. , Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act, establishes that in cases of institutional restructuring and reorganization leading to the dismissal of civil servants or employees, these effects shall be established in the corresponding programmes or plans for the adaptation of human resources drawn up by the Government and approved by the Governing Body, and that in the present case the institution does not have the authority to unilaterally carry out reorganization, or reengineering as the MTI",1,2007,Nicaragua
25,"calls it, to cancel the employment contract of a public servant, which must be previously approved by the Governing Body, and which was not. Furthermore, Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern is a trade union official and is protected by trade union immunity, so it was decided in Resolution No. - of  August  to overrule the appeal lodged by the Minister of the MTI, and as a result the appealed resolution was upheld.' with regard to the breaking of certain clauses of the collective agreement and the request to revise its economic clauses, Mr Carlos Manuel Valdivia Chavarra and other officials from trade unions of workers at the MTI presented a formal complaint against the Minister of the MTI with the Departmental Labour Inspectorate One, for breaking certain clauses of the collective agreement and requesting to revise its economic clauses. In a resolution from the Departmental Labour Inspectorate One, on  May , it was decided to uphold the complaint made by the officials from trade unions of workers at the MTI, as a special inspection had noted that the Minister of the MTI had broken certain clauses of the collective agreement. In Resolution No. - of  August , the General Labour Inspectorate ruled on the appeal lodged by the Minister of the MTI, who did not agree with the resolution handed down by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate One. The General Labour Inspectorate verified by means of a special inspection that the MTI, represented by its Minister, had indeed broken the collective agreement of the MTI in clauses Nos: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  and ; in addition, the employer did not present any reliable evidence to show that the aforementioned clauses of the collective agreement of the MTI had been complied with. Therefore and in accordance with the provisions of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua and articles  and  of the Labour Code and article  of the Labour Inspectors' Regulations, Decree No. -, the appealed resolution was wholly upheld;' with regard to the alleged persecution and workplace harassment of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, the Departmental Inspectorate for the Agriculture, Farming and Industry Sector issued Resolution No. - of  July  finding against the worker. The injured party (Mr Gustavo Antonio Gonzlez Gutirrez) appealed and expressed grievances to the General Labour Inspectorate, which in Resolution No. - of  September  established and shared the opinion issued by the authority, because the reason for the dismissal alleged by the employer was accepted by Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez. This figures in the Record of the Tripartite Committee, the worker alleging that the employer had acted contrary to the provisions of the law (specifically Ministerial Accord No. - that prohibits departmental delegates of the MTI to issue operating permits in any form, proof of authorization, changes of hours, renewal or licences), through verbal instructions by way of telephone calls made by the then Director-General of Land Transport. In addition, that resolution clarified that because Mr Gonzlez Guitrrez is a member of the Executive Committee of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI, he is protected by trade union immunity and the competent authority to authorize his dismissal for just cause is the Ministry of Labour, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code, and not the disciplinary procedure established in Act No. , Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act, as claimed by Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez. Therefore, the General Labour Inspectorate denied the appeal and upheld the resolution of first instance by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate for the Agriculture, Farming and Industry Sector.
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that with a view to destroying and getting rid of the trade unions that are not in agreement with the ideas of the new Government, trade union officials have been dismissed and collective agreements or accords are being broken. Specifically, the complainant alleges: (i) disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  by workers at the MTI regarding the recognition by way of a salary adjustment, the equivalent of  extra hours per month for all the drivers; (ii) violation of numerous clauses of the current collective agreement by the MTI (regarding among other things the use of vehicles assigned to the trade unions on weekends, the use of the premises by the General Secretary of the Independent Trade Union of the MTI and of the auditorium used by this trade union for holding its meetings, etc.); (iii) dismissals, without respect for trade union immunity or legal process, of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI on  April , and of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SMETIAC) on  May ; (iv) workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, Secretary for Labour Matters of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) ' he was dismissed on  May and reinstated the same day and is currently again at risk of dismissal; (v) the transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MIT  Andrs Castro' (SMETIAC); (vi) suspension from work of Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, publications and press secretary of the Independent Union of Workers of the MTI; and (vii) persecution and harassment in order to later on proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI.
.With regard to the alleged disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  by workers at the MTI regarding the recognition by way of a salary adjustment the equivalent of  extra hours per month for all the drivers, the Committee notes from the Government s report that: () it requested information from the MTI and that body indicated that extra hours worked are being paid for as established in law; and () the Labour Inspectorate reported that Resolution No. - had been handed down, ruling on a complaint lodged by the workers; in this regard, considering that the complainants did not prove that a right laid down in any legal standard has been broken, nor that they had at any time received payment for salary adjustment and that a memorandum is not a document that generates rights or obligations; therefore the decision handed down by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of  February  was upheld. In this regard, considering that the Government also reported that the MTI and the trade union organizations concerned signed an agreement extending the validity of the collective agreement in the MTI, the Committee expects that this matter regarding the recognition by way of a salary adjustment, of the equivalent of  additional hours per month for all the drivers, will be the object of negotiations in the future, if it has not been dealt with yet in the current collective agreement.
.With regard to the alleged violation of numerous clauses of the collective agreement by the MTI (regarding, among other things, the use of vehicles assigned to the trade unions on weekends, the use of the premises by the General Secretary of the Independent Trade Union of the MTI and of the auditorium used by this trade union for holding its meetings, etc.), the Committee notes that according to the Government: () the MTI reports that it took the decision to denounce the collective agreement to the Ministry of Labour because upon assuming responsibility for the MTI, the new authorities found it to be in an economically precarious situation and that denouncing it has provoked the start of negotiations, taking into account the current situation of the institution; () in a resolution from the Departmental Labour Inspectorate One on  May  (upheld by a resolution from the General Labour Inspectorate on  August ), the complaint made by the officials from trade unions of workers at the MTI was upheld, as a special inspection had noted that the MTI had broken certain clauses of the collective agreement; the employer did not present any reliable evidence to show that the agreement had been complied with; and () the MTI and the trade union organizations concerned agreed to extend the validity of the collective agreement.
.In these conditions, while recalling that it has underlined on numerous occasions that  agreements should be binding on the parties' and that  mutual respect for the commitment undertaken in collective agreements is an important element of the right to bargain collectively and should be upheld in order to establish labour relations on firm ground' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth edition, , paras  and ], the Committee concludes that all the elements seem to indicate that this question is no longer topical and will therefore not proceed with its",1,2007,Nicaragua
26,"examination.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SMETIAC) on  May , the Committee notes that the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate reported that it decided in the second instance to overrule the appeal lodged by the MTI against the resolution made by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate One on  May  and thereby confirmed that the MTI does not have the authority to unilaterally carry out reorganization or reengineering because the Civil Service and Administrative Careers Act establishes that in cases of institutional restructuring and reorganization leading to the dismissal of civil servants or employees, the effects of the restructuring or reorganization shall be established in the corresponding programmes or plans for the adaptation of human resources drawn up by the Government and approved by the Governing Body, and that in the present case the institution does not have the authority to unilaterally carry out reorganization or reengineering to cancel the employment contract of a public servant; that must be previously approved by the Governing Body and furthermore, Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern is a trade union official protected by trade union immunity. In these conditions, the Committee urges the Government to implement the administrative resolutions and to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that the dismissed union official is reinstated in his post, with payment of outstanding wages and other benefits. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.
.With regard to the alleged persecution and harassment in order to later on proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI, the Committee notes that the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate denied the appeal presented by the official in question against the resolution of the Departmental Inspectorate for the Agriculture, Farming and Industry Sector of  September , because the reason for the dismissal alleged by the employer was accepted by the official in question (according to the Government this figures in the Record of the Tripartite Committee and the worker alleged that they had acted contrary to Ministerial Accord No. - that prohibits departmental delegates of the MTI to issue operating permits in any form, proof of authorization, changes of hours, renewal or licence). In this regard, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal appeal that the union official, Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, may have presented against the resolution of the General Labour Inspectorate.
.With regard to the alleged suspension from work of Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, publications and press secretary of the Independent Union of Workers of the MTI, the Committee notes that according to the Government, the General Labour Inspectorate reports that: () on  June , a request for authorization to cancel the employment contract for not complying with the provisions of the Labour Code was rejected; () the appeal lodged by the union official in question against the ruling of the Departmental Labour Inspectorate One, of  June , with regard to his suspension from work until the ruling of the Tripartite Committee, was overruled; () suspension with salary is not a violation of trade union immunity, as it was verified through a special inspection report that Mr Ruiz Alvarez s salary was not withheld and that he was physically present at the institution, but without defined functions; () the worker was not sanctioned and the suspension was a provisional decision of the employer while awaiting a ruling on his dismissal, which has been submitted for the consideration to the Ministry of Labour; () a request to cancel the employment contract in the Departmental Labour Inspectorate does not constitute a violation of trade union immunity. In this regard, the Committee understands that in this case the official in question has been suspended from work, with payment of salary and without prohibiting his entry into the workplace, and that there is a pending request to cancel the employment contract. In these conditions, the Committee requests the Government to provide information on the specific reasons behind the request to cancel the employment contract of the union official, Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, and to inform it of the final outcome of the proceedings before the Departmental Labour Inspectorate.
.Lastly, noting that the Government states that the High Directorate of the MTI has indicated in a general manner that, with regard to the dismissal of trade union officials, the Labour Code establishes that if a worker or union official does not comply with their employment obligations in accordance with the legislation, they can be dismissed following the procedures established in law, the Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations with regard to the following allegations: (i) dismissal, without respect for trade union immunity or legal process, of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI on  April ; (ii) transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SMETIAC), and (iii) workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, Secretary for Labour Matters of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) ' he was dismissed on  May and reinstated the same day and is currently again at risk of dismissal.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)	With regard to the alleged disregard for and suspension of the bilateral agreement reflected in a memorandum signed on  March  between workers and the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure with regard to the recognition by way of a salary adjustment of the equivalent of  additional hours per month for all the drivers, the Committee, while noting that the MTI and the trade union organizations concerned agreed to extend the validity of the collective agreement in the MTI, expects that this matter will be the object of future negotiations if it has not been dealt with yet in the current collective agreement.(b)	With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr Jos David Hernndez Caldern, secretary of promotion and advertising of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SMETIAC) on  May , the Committee urges the Government to implement the administrative resolutions and to take the necessary measures without delay to ensure that the dismissed union official is reinstated in his post, with payment of outstanding wages and other benefits. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in that regard.(c)	With regard to the alleged persecution and harassment in order to later on proceed to the dismissal of Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, finance secretary of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal appeal that the union official, Mr Gonzlez Gutirrez, may have presented against the resolution of the General Labour Inspectorate.(d)	The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the specific reasons behind the request to cancel the employment contract of the union official, Mr Javier Ruiz Alvarez, and to inform it of the final outcome of the proceedings before the Departmental Labour Inspectorate.(e)	The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations with regard to the following allegations: (i) dismissal, without respect for trade union immunity or legal process, of Mr Jos Mara Centeno, leader of the SINATRA-DGTT-MTI on  April ; (ii) transfer of Mr Marcos Meja Lpez, a member of the Executive Committee of the Union of Employees of the MIT  Andrs Castro' (SMETIAC); and (iii) workplace harassment of union official Mr Alvaro Leiva Snchez, Secretary for Labour Matters of the Union of Employees of the MTI  Andrs Castro' (SEMTIAC) ' he was dismissed on  May and reinstated the same day and is currently again at risk of dismissal.",1,2007,Nicaragua
27,".The Committee last examined this case, concerning the dismissal in  of a trade union official from the Directorate General of Taxes (DGI), at its March  meeting [see th Report, paras ' ]. On that occasion, the Committee noted that the legal proceedings under way concerning the dismissal of the trade union official, Mr Chvez Mendoza, were before the Labour Chamber of the Court of Appeals of the Judicial District of Managua and, regretting the long time that had elapsed since the dismissal of the trade union official, expressed the firm hope that the judicial authority in the second instance would issue a ruling in the very near future.
.In a communication dated  October , the Government reported that: () the case of Mr Chvez Mendoza had concluded with a decision being handed down by the Labour Chamber of the Court of Appeals of Managua in favour of the worker; () according to the assistant labour prosecutor of the DGI, it was impossible to comply with the decision of the judicial authority, and consequently an application was made to the First Labour Court of the Judicial District of Managua to cancel the employment relationship, in accordance with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code; and () the judicial authority found the employment relationship between the worker and the DGI to be ended and ordered that the institution pay him his final settlement pay, due under the law in accordance with abovementioned section  of the Labour Code, without prejudice to the right of Mr Chvez Mendoza to claim payment of any other labour benefits due.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee recalls that when it examined this case in March  and March  it emphasized that Mr Chvez Mendoza was a trade union official and hence should have enjoyed the particular protection afforded by trade union immunity, according to which a trade union official may not be dismissed without the authorization of the Ministry of Labour, a condition which was not fulfilled in this case. The Committee observes that the Government does not refute the failure to comply with the law with respect to the special protection to which union officials are entitled. The Committee notes that, in general, in various complaints against the Government of Nicaragua pending before the Committee concerning anti-union dismissals, the judicial authorities have ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union officials or members and that there has been a failure to comply with those rulings as a result of the payment of compensation prescribed by the law [see, for example, the th Report, Case No. ]. The Committee once again expresses its concern at the fact that it would appear, even in the cases where it was clear that there had been an anti-union dismissal or that the dismissal had not respected legislation relating to the special protection to which union officials should be entitled, that the employer can choose between reinstatement or payment of compensation equivalent to the amount due for the worker s years of service. In this regard, the Committee stresses that no one should be subjected to discrimination or prejudice with regard to employment because of legitimate trade union activities or membership, and the persons responsible for such acts should be punished [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. In addition, on a number of occasions the Committee has emphasized that in the event of the dismissal of trade union officials or members on account of their trade union membership or activities, the best solution is the reinstatement of the workers in their posts and that, in cases where an independent competent body determines, for compelling and objective reasons, that reinstatement in that specific post is no longer possible, steps must be taken to ensure that the complainants receive full and adequate compensation and that there are sufficiently dissuasive sanctions in place to deter anti-union dismissals. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that these principles are upheld in the future and to examine in full consultation with the most representative employers' and workers' organizations, the possibility of amending section  of the Labour Code.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting. The Committee urged the Government to take all steps at its disposal, while respecting the independence of the state authorities, to have trade union official Mr Chvez Mendoza reinstated in his post ' for example, through informal procedures, good offices or mediation ' pending a ruling from the judicial authority on his dismissal [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication dated  November , the Government states that the case of Mr Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza has been heard in two instances: () the First Court of the District of Managua, No. --LB; and () before the Labour Chamber of the Court of Appeal of Managua, No. -ORM-LB. The first stage of the labour procedure was exhausted in this regard. The competent legal authority, the First Judge of the Constituency of Managua, consequently ordered the reinstatement of Mr Chvez Mendoza through a ruling of  April . Making use of the rights conferred upon the parties by labour law, the employer party (the defendant in this case) appealed against the ruling in question, thus initiating the second and definitive stage of the labour court proceedings. According to labour legislation, once an appeal has been accepted, the ruling in the first instance remains unenforced, with the decision issued by the highest labour body, in this case, the Labour Chamber of the Appeal Court of the Constituency of Managua, resolving the case. The case of Mr Chvez Mendoza is currently at this stage. Any ruling issued by this legal body will be respected by the Directorate General of Revenues (DGI), the employer party and defendant in the labour procedure. The Government states that, throughout the proceedings which took place before the corresponding judicial bodies, Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza made use of the rights and guarantees granted him by the Political Constitution and the national labour laws.
.The Committee takes note of this information. While regretting that such a long time has elapsed since the dismissal of the trade union leader Mr Chvez Mendoza (July ), the Committee expresses the firm hope that the judicial authority in the second instance will issue a ruling in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any rulings handed down.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting. The Committee previously urged the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that union official Mr Chvez Mendoza was reinstated in his post without loss of pay until the judicial authority had ruled on his dismissal, and asked the Government to keep it informed in that regard and to send a copy of the final ruling as soon as it was handed down. The Committee also requested the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent investigation was carried out to determine whether there was in fact an anti-union policy against trade unions that were not in agreement with the Government and, if these allegations were shown to be true, to put an immediate end to such anti-union measures and to guarantee free exercise of the trade union activities of those organizations and their officials. At its March  meeting, the Committee noted the Government s statement that workers in Nicaragua have at their disposal two possible ways of enforcing their rights, namely, administrative, through the Ministry of Labour, and judicial, through the labour courts, that Mr Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza chose the second option, and that proceedings are therefore under way in the competent court. The Committee noted with regret that the Government had not communicated the requested information, which suggested that the Government had not taken the measures called for, and it therefore reiterated its previous recommendations [see rd Report, paras ' ].
.In its communication dated  June  the Government stated, with regard to the recommendation to reinstate Mr Chvez Mendoza in his post pending the judicial authority s ruling on his dismissal, that this recommendation is legally impossible to implement in Nicaragua for several reasons. Article  of the Political Constitution determines the independence of the state authorities and article  thereof provides that the judicial power to hand down rulings and enforce them belongs exclusively to the judicial authority. Hence the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity cannot interfere with matters outside its jurisdiction, issuing an order for reinstatement and payment of outstanding wages, which is precisely the matter under dispute in the present case. It is for the judicial authority to determine whether or not the reinstatement and payment of outstanding wages should go ahead. The ILO, being aware of the labour legislation of Nicaragua, knows that the administrative authority has no power to issue any measure once the case is outside its jurisdiction. Moreover, the labour legislation is clear",1,2007,Nicaragua
28,"in this respect since section  of the Labour Code establishes as every worker s legitimate right the power to bring an action in a labour court to seek reinstatement and the payment of outstanding wages if the worker considers that there has been an infringement of the labour legislation, a restriction of his or her rights as a worker or an act of retaliation for exercising or seeking to exercise trade union rights. The Government points out that section  of the Labour Code provides that where termination of the contract by the employer is proven to have been in breach of the prohibitive provisions of the Labour Code and other labour regulations, or constitutes an act which restricts the worker s rights, or has the nature of retaliation against the worker for exercising or seeking to exercise labour or trade union rights, the worker shall be able to bring an action in the labour court to request reinstatement in the same post as before and under identical working conditions, the employer being obliged, if the reinstatement is upheld, to pay all outstanding wages and effect the reinstatement. Where the reinstatement is upheld and the employer fails to comply with the judicial ruling, the latter shall be obliged to pay the worker, on top of the compensation due, a sum equivalent to  per cent thereof. The labour court must settle such cases within  days of the action being filed and in the event of an appeal, the court in question must do so within  days of taking over the proceedings. Both deadlines are mandatory and, should any judge or magistrate fail to settle the case within the prescribed deadline, the respective superior shall, at the request of the injured party, impose a fine equivalent to  per cent of the salary of the judicial officer concerned.
.As regards the Committee s recommendation that the Government take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent investigation was carried out to determine whether there was in fact an anti-union policy against trade unions that were not in agreement with the Government, the Government gives the assurance that the complaint on which this recommendation is based is groundless, for the following reasons. Trade union pluralism has prevailed in Nicaragua since  and this is closely linked to political pluralism. Thousands of workers freely and peacefully join trade unions of their own choosing. The wide range of unions includes the following: Confederation of Trade Union Action and Unity (CAUS); General Confederation of Independent Workers (CGT(I)); Workers' Federation of Nicaragua (CTN); General Confederation of Education Workers (CGTEN ANDEN); Federation of Health Workers (FETSALUD); Jos Benito Escobar Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST(JB)); Nicaraguan Workers' Federation (CNT); Pablo Martnez Sandinista General Workers' Confederation (CGST); Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC); National Employees' Union (UNE); Confederation of Labour Unification (CUS); Autonomous Workers' Federation of Nicaragua (CTN(A)); Confederation for Worker Unification (CUT); National Teachers' Confederation of Nicaragua (CNMN); National Workers' Front (FNT). The above list comprises just the organizations which are national in scope. All of them are linked to various partisan organizations or ideologies and all of them are active in the country, without any limitations imposed. They also include workers from the various public and private economic sectors of the country and all the departments into which Nicaragua is politically divided. They are vigorous in the defence of their union interests and can at any given time present a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, with highly politicized overtones, to the relevant bodies of the ILO, for alleged violations of freedom of association or for failure to comply with the provisions of a Convention ratified by Nicaragua. Furthermore, they can submit a request to the country s labour authorities for failure to comply with one or more clauses of the collective agreement or for alleged violations of the national labour legislation. Moreover, freedom of association in Nicaragua is guaranteed by the provisions of the Political Constitution, and the Labour Code ensures trade union immunity for persons who have established, or are in the process of establishing, a trade union. Trade union autonomy is protected inasmuch as unions have the right to: (a) freely draft their statutes and regulations; (b) freely elect their representatives; (c) choose their organic structure, administration and activities; and (d) formulate their programme of action. (Attached to the Government s reply are statistics showing the numbers of organizations established in various years, as follows:  trade unions,  federations, three confederations and two central organizations (centrales) in ;  trade unions,  federations and seven central organizations in ; and  trade unions, six federations and one confederation in .)
.The Committee notes this information and in particular the statistics sent by the Government in connection with the number of trade unions established between  and . The Committee recalls that when it examined this case in March  it emphasized that Mr Chvez Mendoza was a trade union official and hence should have enjoyed the particular protection afforded by trade union immunity, according to which a trade union official may not be dismissed without the authorization of the Ministry of Labour, a condition which was not fulfilled in this case. The Committee further recalls that the union official in question was dismissed in July , that he took legal action in this connection, and that section  of the Labour Code, quoted by the Government, states that judicial proceedings of this type must be settled within  days at the first instance and within  days at the second instance (the section also states that these deadlines are mandatory and any judges who fail to respect them may be penalized). In this respect, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that even though nearly three years have elapsed since the dismissal no judicial ruling has been issued in this respect. Consequently the Committee, as it has done in previous cases involving excessive delays in judicial proceedings relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders, urges the Government to take all steps at its disposal, while respecting the independence of the state authorities, to have trade union official Mr Chvez Mendoza reinstated in his post ' for example, through informal procedures, good offices or mediation ' pending a ruling from the judicial authority on his dismissal. The Committee also recalls that justice delayed is justice denied and firmly expects the judicial authority to issue a ruling in the very near future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting and on that occasion urged the Government once again to take the necessary steps to ensure that Mr Chvez Mendoza was reinstated in his post without loss of pay until the judicial authority had ruled on his dismissal, and asked the Government to keep it informed in that regard and to send a copy of the final ruling as soon as it was handed down. The Committee requested the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent investigation was carried out to determine whether there was in fact an anti-union policy against trade unions that were not in agreement with the Government and, if these allegations were shown to be true, to put an immediate end to such anti-union measures and to guarantee free exercise of the trade union activities of those organizations and their officials [see st Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication dated  December , the Government reiterates the statements made in its communication of  May , when it indicated that workers in Nicaragua have at their disposal two possible ways of enforcing their rights, namely, administrative, through the Ministry of Labour, and judicial, through the labour courts. In this case, Mr Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza chose the second option, and proceedings are under way before the competent court.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not communicated the information requested, which suggests that the Government has not taken the measures it had requested; it therefore reiterates its previous recommendations.
.The Committee last examined this case at its meeting of March , at which it made the following recommendations:(a)	Bearing in mind the status of Mr Chvez Mendoza as a trade union official, and that the legislation requires the authorization of the Ministry of Labour to dismiss a trade union official, which did not occur in the present case, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that he is reinstated in his post without loss of pay until the judicial authority gives its final judgement and to send a copy of the ruling as soon as it is handed down.(b)	The Committee further requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that an independent investigation is carried out to determine if there is in fact an anti-union policy against trade unions that are not in agreement with the Government and, if these allegations are shown to be true, immediately to put an immediate end",1,2007,Nicaragua
29,"to such anti-union measures and to guarantee the free exercise of trade union activities of those organizations and their officials. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that it sent observations in a timely reply, and repeats that in Nicaragua there are two means of redress available to workers claiming their rights, administrative remedies, through the Ministry of Labour, and judicial remedies, through the labour courts. In this case, Mr Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza chose the second option, so judicial proceedings are under way in the appropriate labour court.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It recalls that when it last examined this case, pointing out that Mr Chvez Mendoza had the status of a trade union official and that the legislation requires the authorization of the Ministry of Labour to dismiss such an official, it observed that this did not occur in the present case. In these circumstances, the Committee once again urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that Mr Chvez Mendoza is reinstated in his post without loss of pay until the judicial authority has ruled on his dismissal, and asks the Government to keep it informed in this regard and to send a copy of the final ruling as soon as it is handed down. The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation and asks the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out to determine whether there is in fact an anti-union policy against trade unions that are not in agreement with the Government and, if these allegations are shown to be true, to put an immediate end to such anti-union measures and to guarantee free exercise of the trade union activities of those organizations and their officials.
.This complaint is contained in a communication dated  August .
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September and  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  August , the Confederation of Labour Unification (CUS) alleges that Mr Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza was dismissed on  July  from his post in the Directorate General of Taxes (DGI), a decentralized agency attached to the Ministry of the Treasury and Public Borrowing, despite his position as trade union official, serving as finance secretary to the Democratic Staff Union of the DGI.
.According to the complainant organization, the arguments presented by the employer for proceeding with the dismissal were that Mr Chvez Mendoza exercised a position of trust. The complainant organization adds that neither the right of employment stability established in article  of the Act on the Civil Service and the Administrative Career, nor the trade union rights established in article  of the Labour Code, whereby the dismissal of a trade union official requires the authorization of the Ministry of Labour, were respected.
.The CUS alleges that Mr Chvez Mendoza submitted a judicial appeal on  July , which has still not been decided, and indicated that there are considerable delays in issuing judgements in the judicial system in Nicaragua.
.The complainant organization adds that this dismissal is part of a policy aimed at the destruction of trade unions which oppose the new Government. The complainant organization indicates that the directors of public entities, recently appointed by the new Government, interfere in trade union activities and participate in trade unions supportive of the Government, with the intention of destroying organizations which are not in agreement with the Government, dismissing the latter s officials, without respecting trade union rights or legal provisions, due to their trade union activities in defence of workers' rights and collective agreements concluded previously.
.In its communications of  September and  October , the Government indicates that Mr Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza was dismissed from the DGI in accordance with the legislation. Mr Chvez Mendoza was employed as adviser in the Procurement Unit of the Material and Financial Resources Division of the DGI. According to the Government, this is a position of trust within the institution, as laid down in article  of the Labour Code and article  of the Act on the Civil Service and the Administrative Career, which provides that the category of employee and official in a position of trust applies to those  whom the Administration of the State contracts to provide personal services or hold permanent advisory posts in technical assistance and technical assistance and/or directive administration in offices of the principal public officials'  Mr Chvez Mendoza was the sole adviser on procurement matters in the DGI. It was he who directly advised the administrative finance director on legal matters related to State contracts. Without his signature, the finance director could not contract or acquire the goods and services needed by the DGI at national level. In addition, he acted as legal adviser to the Tenders Committee, which is the administrative organ which administers over  per cent of the public budget allocated to the Directorate General of Taxes.
.The Government adds that article  of the Act on the Civil Service and the Administrative Career establishes exceptions relating to the administrative career for officials and employees in positions of trust, whereby there is no prior legal procedure or requirement for terminating their employment.
.In addition, the Government indicates that Mr Chvez Mendoza did not instigate administrative actions against his dismissal but appealed directly to the court, where the action is still pending.
.The Committee observes that this case refers to the dismissal of a trade union official in the Directorate General of Taxes (DGI) without the relevant removal of trade union immunity.
.The Committee notes that, according to the allegations submitted by the Confederation of Labour Unification (CUS), Mr Donaldo Jos Chvez Mendoza was dismissed on  July  from his post in the DGI despite his trade union immunity as finance secretary to the Democratic Staff Union of the DGI. The Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, the dismissal was part of a policy aimed at the destruction of all those trade unions which opposed the new Government. The Committee also notes that Mr Chvez Mendoza initiated legal action for reinstatement, which despite the time elapsed is still pending.
.The Committee notes the Government s observation that Mr Chvez Mendoza was employed in the Directorate General of Taxes in a position of trust, in relation to which article  of the Act on the Civil Service and the Administrative Career establishes exceptions relating to the administrative career for officials and employees in positions of trust, whereby there is no prior legal procedure or requirement for terminating their employment. The Committee notes that the Government indicates that Mr Chvez Mendoza resorted to the court, and that no judgement has been given up to now.
.In this respect, the Committee emphasizes that although according to the Government, Mr Chvez Mendoza exercised a position of trust and consequently in accordance with the law, it could terminate his services without any prior proceedings, he was also a trade union official and by virtue of that position, should have been the subject of the special protection provided by the guarantee of trade union immunity according to which an official cannot be dismissed without the authorization of the Ministry of Labour, which was not done. In this respect, the Committee recalls that one way of ensuring the protection of trade union officials is to provide that these officials may not be dismissed, either during their period of office or for a certain time thereafter except, of course, for serious misconduct. One of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association, fifth edition, , para. ].
.As regards the allegations that the dismissal of Mr Chvez Mendoza is part of a policy intended to destroy trade unions opposed to the new Government, the Committee observes that the Government does not send its observations in this respect. The Committee recalls that freedom of association entails respect for the right of trade unions and their officials to their opinions, even in those cases where they criticize the",1,2007,Nicaragua
30,"country s social and economic policies.
.In these circumstances, bearing in mind the status of Mr Chvez Mendoza as a trade union official, and that the legislation requires the authorization of the Ministry of Labour to dismiss a trade union official, which did not occur in the present case, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that he is reinstated in his post without loss of pay until the judicial authority gives its final judgement and to send a copy of the ruling as soon as it is handed down. The Committee further requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that an independent investigation is carried out to determine if there is in fact an anti-union policy against trade unions that are not in agreement with the Government and, if these allegations are shown to be true, to put an immediate end to such anti-union measures and to guarantee the free exercise of trade union activities of those organizations and their officials. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Bearing in mind the status of Mr Chvez Mendoza as a trade union official, and that the legislation requires the authorization of the Ministry of Labour to dismiss a trade union official, which did not occur in the present case, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure that he is reinstated in his post without loss of pay until the judicial authority gives its final judgement and to send a copy of the ruling as soon as it is handed down.(b) The Committee further requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that an independent investigation is carried out to determine if there is in fact an anti-union policy against trade unions that are not in agreement with the Government and, if these allegations are shown to be true, immediately to put an immediate end to such anti-union measures and to guarantee the free exercise of trade union activities of those organizations and their officials. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2007,Nicaragua
31,".At its November  meeting, the Committee took due note of the Government s information that, as a result of the judgement issued by the Trade Union Associations Directorate on  May , the executive committee of the Trade Union of Employees in Higher Education  Ervin Abarca Jimenes' (SIPRES-UNI, ATD) was registered, and that, on  June , the parties were notified. The Committee requested the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the union dues were paid over to the trade union in question, and to promote collective bargaining and keep it informed in that respect [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication of  August , the SIPRES-UNI, ATD states that the Trade Union Associations Directorate in June  registered the executive committee in the light of the ruling given by the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, but some weeks ago revoked the registration, citing a judicial order which it claims was issued by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court to suspend the union s registration in order to deprive the union of its leadership and render it powerless to exercise its rights, the ruling in question not being subject to further appeal. As regards trade union membership dues, the Labour Affairs Chamber of the Managua Appeals Court, instead of ensuring that the dues in question were paid in accordance with the ruling of the First Civil Affairs Judge, overturned that ruling and disallowed any further appeal. As a result of this, the dues in question have to date still not been paid to the union. As regards the negotiation of a collective agreement, the Ministry of Labour authorities refuse to resume collective bargaining despite a number of requests to do so.
.In a communication of  December , the Government states that this case, since , has resulted in a number of administrative and judicial actions on the part of the two unions in dispute. Both unions have sought recourse to the authorities, which in some cases has led to disputes regarding competence that have had to be resolved by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. The most recent of these rulings was given on  June  by the Constitutional Chamber. The Trade Union Associations Directorate and the Labour Relations Directorate of the Ministry of Labour were informed in a writ of the following decision resulting from the application for constitutional protection (amparo) (No. -) filed by Mr Silvio Joel Araica Aguilar:  The court considers that: (i) the effect of suspension blocks or suspends the decision claimed by the petitioner to be unconstitutional, which must in consequence not be implemented; (ii) once an order has been given to suspend an official decision, the authorities concerned must refrain from further action of whatever nature to implement that decision, as failure to do so will constitute disregard for the explicit decision of the authority ordering the suspension which has the effect of prohibiting any action by the responsible authorities to carry out the action in question. Consequently this Chamber hereby decides: that in accordance with section  of the Act on constitutional protection (amparo) in force, the current Director of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour, Mr Roberto Jos Rodrguez Arias, is required to comply with the suspension of the decision issued by Civil Chamber  of Managua Appeals Court; and (iii) the registration of the executive board of the Trade Union of Employees in Higher Education  Ervin Abarca Jimenes' (SIPRES-UNI, ATD), comprising the General Secretary, Mr Julio Noel Canales, and other members, is suspended and has no legal force until such time as the Constitutional Chamber give a ruling on the substance of the claim' 
.This decision by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice is of crucial importance for the Ministry of Labour, as it is legally binding. Article  of Nicaragua s Political Constitution states that the following are constitutional laws: the Electoral Act (Ley Electoral), the Emergencies Act (Ley de Emergencia) and the Act regarding constitutional protection (Ley de Amparo). In other words, the Act on constitutional protection has constitutional status and is an integral part of the fundamental framework of Nicaraguan law. Article  of the Nicaraguan Constitution stipulates that an application for constitutional protection can be made  against any provision, act or decision and in general against any action or omission by any official, authority or agent thereof, that violates or is intended to violate the rights and guarantees enshrined in the Political Constitution'  According to article  of the Political Constitution, it is the function of the Supreme Court of Justice:  ...() to examine and resolve applications for constitutional protection arising from violations of rights established in the Constitution, in accordance with the Act concerning constitutional protection'  Lastly, article  of the Constitution stipulates that  Rulings and decisions of courts and judges must be implemented by the state authorities, organizations and natural or legal persons concerned by them ' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.Given this legal framework, Ministry of Labour officials are required to implement Supreme Court rulings. It is not within the competence of the state authorities to qualify such rulings; they are required to comply with them or face criminal proceedings for contempt. That means that, according to the ruling in question, no department of the Ministry of Labour may carry out any act that could be interpreted as non-compliance with what has been decided by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. The parties to the dispute similarly must comply with what has been ordered by the Constitutional Chamber until such time as the latter has ruled on the substance of the dispute. Lastly the Government indicates that the certification given by the Directorate for Trade Union Associations on  June , concerning the SIPRES-UNI, ATD was issued following a recommendation by the ILO s Committee on Freedom of Association, but also pursuant to the aforementioned ruling of the Constitutional Chamber; the latter is the  final ruling of the Constitutional Chamber, which will rule on the substance of the matter'  and orders a suspension of further action on this case. The Directorate of Trade Union Associations suspended the certification of the executive body in question until such time as the application for constitutional protection could be resolved. The parties concerned have, to their credit, availed themselves of the remedies provided for by national legislation, both administrative and legal.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It trusts that the judicial authorities will hand down a ruling very soon regarding the registration of the executive board of SIPRESUNI, ATD and that the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that the trade union membership dues are paid to the union in question and to promote collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee urged the Government to register the executive committee of the Trade Union of Employees in Higher Education  Ervin Abarca Jimenes' (SIPRES-UNI, ATD) without delay, to ensure that the union dues are paid over to it and to promote collective bargaining [see th Report, paras  to ].
.In its communication dated  June , the Government reports that, as a result of the judgement issued by the Trade Union Associations Directorate on  May , the executive committee of the Trade Union of Employees in Higher Education  Ervin Abarca Jimenes' (SIPRES-UNI, ATD) was registered and on  June  the parties were notified.
.The Committee takes due note of this information. The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the union dues are paid over to the trade union in question and to promote collective bargaining, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.At its meeting in March  the Committee made the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee regrets that the Trade Union Associations Directorate of the Ministry of Labour has not enforced the appellate judgement against the General Labour Inspectorate decision of  February , ordering the registration of the executive committee of the complainant trade union, and that the Trade Union Associations Directorate has not extended certification to that executive, thus preventing the complainant trade union from defending its members' interests, in particular through collective bargaining. The Committee regrets the administrative delays which occurred in this case, and requests the Government to execute the ruling of the judicial authority dated  August , mentioned by the Government, which ordered the registration of the executive committee of Mr. Julio Noel Canales.(b) The Committee expects the Government in future to guarantee fully the right of workers' organizations to elect their representatives in full freedom, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , as well as the principle that  in order to avoid the danger of serious limitations on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom, cases brought before the courts by",1,2004,Nicaragua

.In its communication dated  May , the Trade Union of Employees in Higher Education  Ervin Abarac Jimenez' (SIPRES UNI, ATD) denounces the Government s failure to comply with the Committee s recommendations despite the complainant organization s request to the President of the Republic and to the Rector of the National University of Engineering (the employer), with the result that the union s executive committee is still not registered, its members' monthly dues have still not been paid over to the union and collective bargaining is still suspended.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the complainant organization while at the same time regretting the lack of information from the Government, and urges the Government to register the executive committee of the complainant trade union without delay, to ensure that the union dues are paid over to it and to promote collective bargaining. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

33,".The Committee last examined this case at its March  session, and on that occasion hoped that the Managua Appeals Court would hand down a decision in relation to the dismissal of the teachers and trade union leaders, Norlan Jos Toruo Araz and Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto, and recalled that justice delayed is justice denied [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication of  December , the Government recalls that the teachers in question lodged an appeal against the ruling in the first instance in relation to the dismissal proceedings and indicates that, according to the Ministry of Education, in a decision of  December , the Labour Chamber of the Court of Appeals of Managua rejected the appeal and upheld the ruling of the court of the first instance, which did not accept the petition for reinstatement.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee recalls that, according to the Government, in its communication of  September  (communication considered by the Committee in its previous examination of the case), the court of the first instance did not accept the petition for reinstatement but ordered that the officials in question be paid the social benefits provided by law, such as a Christmas bonus and proportionate holidays. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the payments of such benefits are made.
.The Committee examined this case at its March and November  sessions and, on that occasion, expressed the hope that the judicial authority in the second instance would hand down a decision soon and requested the Government to keep it informed of the judgement rendered in relation to the dismissal of trade union leaders Norlan Jos Toruo Araz and Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto and, if a reinstatement order was issued, to take the necessary measures to comply with that order immediately [see th Report, paras ' ; and rd Report, paras ' ].
.In a communication of  October , the Government points out that the teachers in question filed an appeal against the judicial decision in the first instance with the Managua Appeals Court, which is currently pending judgement.
.The Committee takes note of this information and regrets the long time that has elapsed without a final judicial decision in relation to the dismissal of the trade union leaders in . The Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied, hopes that the Managua Appeals Court will hand down a decision soon and requests the Government to send it a copy of the judgement rendered.
.The Committee last examined this case at its March  meeting and, on that occasion, requested the Government to keep it informed of the court judgement concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders Norlan Jos Toruo Araz and Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto and, if the court so directed, to take the necessary effective measures to comply with the reinstatement order immediately [see th Report, paras. -].
.In a communication of  May , the Government points out that, as it had stated in its previous communication, the administrative authority authorized the termination of the teaching contracts of Mr. Norlan Jos Toruo Araz and Mr. Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto at the request of the director of the NERA  Rubn Daro' educational establishment, in accordance with sections , subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), (h) and (m), and  of the Labour Code, and sections (), () and () and (), of the Act respecting the teaching profession, as well as sections , (), () and (), (a) and (a), (c) and (d) of the latter Act, which relate to unethical conduct, dereliction of duty, and repeated and unjustified failure to discharge the obligations inherent in the job. The Departmental Inspectorate for the Service Sector approved the termination, and its decision was upheld on appeal by the General Labour Inspectorate. Since Mr. Toruo and Mr. Rodrguez did not agree with the decisions handed down by the administrative authority, on  November , they decided to initiate proceedings for reinstatement before the court of the municipality of Tipitapa which, on  November , handed down a judicial decision rejecting the action brought before the ordinary labour court. An appeal against the judicial decision in the first instance was filed with the Appeal Court of Managua and is now pending judgement.
.The Committee notes this information. The Committee hopes that the judicial authority in the second instance will hand down a decision shortly and requests the Government to keep it informed of the judgement rendered.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  July .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that on examining this case at its March  session, it requested the Government to keep it informed of the ongoing legal cases regarding the dismissal of union leaders, the work situation of union members, the failure to implement judicial orders for reinstatement, the inability of CGTEN-ANDEN to participate in the National Education Commission, the refusal to allow CGTEN-ANDEN leaders to access the academic establishments or to benefit from union leave, and the preferential treatment for other trade unions in the sector. Recalling that in the past it had observed problems of cooperation in relation to the submission of complete information by the Government, the Committee notes with interest the efforts now carried out in order to respond to its requests.Recommendation (a)()
.Regarding the work situation of union leader Mr. Julio Jimmy Hernndez, the Committee is satisfied to note that the Government and the complainant have reported that he has been reinstated to his post and paid wage arrears.Recommendation (a)()
.Regarding the professional situation of trade union leader Norlan Jos Toruo Araz and Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant organization, these workers have been reinstated in , but dismissed again. According to the Government, both officials appealed the decision to terminate their contracts to the judicial authority. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the judicial decisions that will be issued in respect of these two union officials and to take effective measures to reinstate them immediately, if the court directs it.Recommendation (b)

.As regards the alleged failure to implement judicial orders for the reinstatement of union leaders and the payment of outstanding wages (Jos Antonio Zepeda, Rger Benito Acevedo Jimnez, Miriam Olivas Ardn and Miriam Gutirrez Garca), the Committee is satisfied to note that, according to the complainant organization, trade union leaders Jos Antonio Zepeda and Rger Benito Acevedo Jimnez have been reinstated in their posts with back-pay, and that officials Miriam Olivas Ardn and Miriam Gutirrez Garca have received their salary and do not want to resume their duties.Recommendation (d)
.With regards to the allegation concerning the Government s refusal to allow CGTEN-ANDEN to participate in the National Education Commission, the Committee is satisfied to note that the Government and the complainant report that since April , CGTEN-ANDEN has participated in the National Education Commission.Recommendation (e)
.With respect to the allegations concerning written orders from the MECD to educational establishments to bar entry to CGTEN-ANDEN leaders in the context of the exercise of their union duties, the Committee is satisfied to note that, according to the information provided by the complainant organization and the Government, these leaders can now access education establishments.Recommendation (f)
.Concerning the alleged preferential treatment of certain unions by the MECD, providing office facilities and other benefits such as the use of telephones in return for supporting the Government, the Committee is satisfied to note that according to the complainant organization and the Government, the latter has ceased giving preferential economic treatment to other trade unions. The Committee also notes the Government s indication that the MECD currently treats all trade union organizations equally and that they all enjoy the same social benefits as in the education sector.Recommendation (g)
.As regards the allegations concerning the refusal of the MECD to grant paid union leave to officials of the complainant organization, the Committee is satisfied to note that according to the complainant organization and the Government, the latter complies with its obligation to grant trade union leave to its leaders.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the court judgement concerning the dismissal of trade union leaders Norlan Jos Toruo Araz and Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto and, if the court so directs, to take the necessary effective measures to comply with the reinstatement order immediately.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the General Confederation of Education Workers of Nicaragua (CGTEN-ANDEN) dated May . In communications dated  and  June , the International Confederation",1,2004,Nicaragua
34,"of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and Education International (EI) supported the complaint.
.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  September and  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May , the General Confederation of Education Workers of Nicaragua (CGTEN-ANDEN) states that between June and July , agreements were signed between the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (MECD) and the trade unions in the education sector. The agreements are the culmination of a long struggle by the teaching profession since early .
.Nevertheless, the complainant organization alleges the following violations of Conventions Nos.  and  by the Government:
.Finally, the complainant organization states that the MECD refuses to initiate negotiations as provided for by law, claiming that it is not yet time to do so since the budget has not been approved, but above all it calls on its affiliated organizations to manoeuvre and display reluctance to negotiate.
.In its communications dated  September and  October , the Government states that there is full freedom in Nicaragua for workers and employers to establish the organizations they consider relevant for watching over and protecting their interests, and that the right to organize as trade unions is a constitutional right for both parties to the labour relationship. The Political Constitution lays down that there is unlimited freedom for organizing as trade unions or for not doing so.
.With respect to the complaint in question, the Government indicates that it maintains a clear policy of negotiation (employers and workers), guaranteeing the human rights of workers and employers, in particular the principles of freedom of association and trade union pluralism.
.As regards the situation of the union officials referred to by the complainant organization, the Government points out that it is the State s obligation to guarantee that workers' representatives enjoy effective protection against any harmful act committed on account of their union status or activities. This is the concept of trade union immunity, which employers are obliged to accept and in accordance with which they may not interfere in any way with the formation or operation of trade unions. Anyone enjoying trade union immunity may not be punished or dismissed without just cause previously authorized by the Ministry of Labour. Labour legislation invokes clear grounds for termination of a contract and authorization by the Ministry of Labour to dismiss those to whom the law affords special protection. The Government adds that the holding of union office does not confer such immunity on the holder as to allow him to break the law: trade union immunity shall and does protect lawful acts. When a worker is continually absent from work without the employer s permission, it does not constitute a violation of the freedom of association.
.The Government makes the following specific points:- with respect to Mr. Julio Jimmy Hernndez Paisano, labour secretary of the Departmental Federation of Teaching Staff in Managua, the appropriate channels under current labour legislation were used to secure his compliance with his obligations, in view of the fact that, in full violation of his contractual obligations, he refused to perform his duties consistently (according to the Government, he is not on trade union leave);- as regards Mr. Norlan Jos Toruo Araz, member of the union affiliated to ANDEN, the head of NERA  Rubn Daro' education centre in the municipality of Tipitapa in the department of Managua appeared before the departmental labour inspectorate to request authorization to terminate his contract. The administrative proceedings opened with a four-day period involving both parties. The respondent alleged that the departmental labour inspectorate was not competent to handle proceedings concerning his dismissal, since there are specific labour provisions which take precedence over the General Act establishing the Labour Code, and he therefore asked that the inspectorate be taken off the case. During the evidentiary period, the complainant submitted abundant evidence to support the grounds invoked by the employer, laid down by section (d) of the Labour Code. Proof was given of the misconduct of which the teacher had been guilty, failing to discharge the obligations laid down in his contract and those contained in the General Regulations on Primary Education. According to testimonies from the employer, the teacher took it upon himself to set parents and members of the school council against the headmaster. The school suffered serious harm from interruptions to classes, the organization of protests, the closure of gates preventing staff access, and from his dereliction of duty for the purpose of performing tasks not specified by his plan of work, all these actions having no legal authorization. The departmental inspector issued an order for the termination of the contract. Availing himself of his rights under labour law, the worker appealed against the order (the Government also refers in its reply to another worker who was not mentioned by the complainant organization);- concerning union leader Mr. Manuel Sebastin Mendieta Martnez, the Government requests further information in this respect, since to date, no action has been brought before the Ministry of Labour by either the employer or the worker.
.With regard to the alleged non-compliance with judicial rulings ordering the reinstatement of dismissed union officials and the payment of outstanding wages, the Government points out that where the employer unilaterally cancels the contract of a union official, the latter may apply to the labour judge to request reinstatement and the payment of outstanding wages and benefits, within  days following the dismissal. If the labour judge orders the reinstatement, the employer is obliged to implement it and pay the wages and benefits owed to the workers in question. The Government indicates that the Labour Code provides that the employer may pay double the seniority indemnity to a worker in respect of whom a definitive reinstatement order has been issued. According to case law, union officials have the choice either to accept the double indemnity or actually to be reinstated.
.Regarding the premises for union meetings in the education sector, the MECD reiterates its undertaking to provide facilities for trade unions which are signatories to the collective agreement. The said unions are provided with the use of the facilities of departmental study centres for holding assemblies or meetings or undertaking any other union activity.
.As regards trade union leave, the collective agreement provides the unions with up to  days each for activities which they consider appropriate. The MECD has a fund of up to NIC, to cover replacements for leave granted for union training, seminars and congresses. Leave with pay is granted by the Central Human Resources Department no later than two days after the request is made. The unions undertake in turn to ensure that leave is used appropriately and in accordance with the applicable conditions.
.The Government emphasizes that at the MECD there are  organizations of education workers duly constituted and registered with the Directorate of Trade Unions at the Ministry of Labour, and that CGTEN-ANDEN and the other unions are joint signatories to the collective agreement in force for -. There is therefore no violation of freedom of association or social/labour rights as claimed in the present complaint.
.With regard to the alleged exclusion of CGTEN-ANDEN from the National Education Commission, the Government indicates that this statement has no legal basis, as proved by the memo issued on  July  by the President of the National Education Commission placing on record that there is no application for membership from the representatives of CGTEN-ANDEN in the Commission s files.
.With respect to the exercise of the right to strike, the Government indicates that Article  of the Political Constitution recognizes the right to strike and that the right to strike of workers and their organizations constitutes one of the fundamental means at their disposal for promoting and defending their interests. According to the Government, holding public demonstrations is an important aspect of union rights. Nevertheless, the distinction must be made between demonstrations with purely union aims and demonstrations which have other objectives, such as criticizing the Government s economic and social policy. The important thing is that those means are exercised peacefully in accordance with the principles of freedom of association laid down in ILO Convention No. .
.With regard to trade union dues, the Government states that the opening of a check-off code for CGTEN-ANDEN was authorized in April . Every duly constituted trade union in the education sector, such as CGTEN-ANDEN, can access the codes in order to receive its respective trade union dues as laid down by section  of the Labour Code.
.Finally, the Government declares that Article () (in Chapter V, Labour Rights) of the Political Constitution reads as follows:  The inalienable right of workers to conclude collective agreements with employers in defence of their individual or union interests is guaranteed.'  The MECD has followed the procedures and conducted the negotiations prescribed by law with the various unions of education workers which have",0,2004,Nicaragua
35,"been duly constituted and registered with the Directorate-General of Trade Unions at the Ministry of Labour, concluding a collective labour agreement which guarantees economic, social and employment-related improvements for education workers. This is confirmed and demonstrated by the conclusion of the - collective agreement, negotiated with six confederations (including CGTEN-ANDEN), six federations, four departmental unions and seven unions.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organization alleges acts of anti-union persecution against its leaders, non-compliance with orders for the reinstatement of dismissed union leaders and the payment of outstanding wages, the granting of benefits (offices, use of telephones, etc.) to pro-Government organizations in the sector, the denial of union leave to its leaders, the impossibility of participating in the National Education Commission, the violation of agreements between the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (MECD) and educational establishments, the failure to pay salary increases agreed upon in the collective agreement, the declaration by the authorities that a strike in the sector would be illegal, the refusal to deduct members' union dues at source, the MECD s refusal to launch the negotiations prescribed by law or to allow union leaders access to various educational establishments.
.As regards the allegations concerning acts of anti-union persecution against leaders of the complainant organization, Messrs. Julio Jimmy Hernndez Paisano, Norlan Jos Toruo Araz, Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto and Manuel Sebastin Mendieta Martnez, the Committee notes that the Government indicates that: () with regard to Mr. Julio Jimmy Hernndez Paisano, who is not on union leave, the latter has refused to comply with his obligation to resume his duties; () as regards Mr. Norlan Jos Toruo Araz: (a) the management of NERA  Rubn Daro' education centre requested authorization to terminate his contract; (b) an administrative investigation was set in motion and evidence was given of misconduct on the part of the official in question (the entrance gates were closed, barring entry to the staff, and he abandoned his duties for the purpose of engaging in tasks not specified by his plan of work); (c) the departmental inspectorate issued an order for termination of his contract and he lodged an appeal against the order; and () with regard to union official Mr. Manuel Mendieta Martnez, further information is needed since no proceedings have been brought before the Ministry of Labour by either the worker or the employer.
.In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed: () on the work situation of union leader Mr. Julio Jimmy Hernndez Paisano (specifically, whether he has been dismissed for dereliction of duty) and on whether he has lodged an appeal in this respect; and () on the result of the appeal made by union leader Mr. Norlan Jos Toruo Araz against the administrative decision to authorize the termination of his contract. In addition, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation in relation to the work situation of union official Mr. Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto, with respect to whom it was also alleged that the termination of his contract had been requested, and to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the allegation that union leader Mr. Manuel Sebastin Mendieta Martnez was the victim of anti-union persecution, having had a person assigned to watch his movements, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to carry out an investigation into these allegations and to send its observations in this respect.
.As regards the alleged failure to implement judicial orders for the reinstatement of union officials and the payment of outstanding wages (the complainant organization refers by name to the officials concerned), the Committee notes that the Government states that: () if an order for reinstatement is issued by the labour judge, the employer is obliged to comply with it and pay the outstanding wages; and () the Labour Code stipulates that the employer may pay double the seniority indemnity to a worker covered by a definitive reinstatement ruling and, according to case law, union leaders have the choice either to accept the double indemnity or actually to be reinstated. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the union officials named above by the complainant organization may opt freely for the implementation of the judicial decision or to accept the said indemnity. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.Concerning the alleged preferential treatment of certain unions by the MECD, providing office facilities and other benefits such as the use of telephones in return for supporting the Government, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the MECD repeats its undertaking to provide facilities for those unions which are signatories to the collective agreement and accordingly provides them with facilities at departmental study centres so that they can hold assemblies, meetings or any other activity. In this respect, observing that all the unions which are representative in the sector may benefit from the use of the premises for carrying out their activities, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee that, in compliance with the undertaking mentioned above, the complainant organization may enjoy the same benefits as the other unions of the sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.As regards the allegations concerning the refusal of the MECD to grant paid union leave to officials of the complainant organization, while doing so for other unions in the sector, the Committee notes the Government s statement that: () up to  days each for all the unions is laid down in the collective agreement so that they can carry out whatever union activities they see fit, and () paid leave is granted by the Central Human Resources Department no later than two days after the request is made, and the unions undertake in turn to ensure that leave is used appropriately. In this respect, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement, the officials of the complainant organization can avail themselves of paid union leave. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the Government s refusal to allow CGTEN ANDEN to participate in the National Education Commission, the Committee notes the Government s statement that in the Committee s records there is no application to join the Committee from the complainant organization. In this respect, observing that the Government does not oppose the complainant organization s participation in the National Education Commission, the Committee requests the Government, if CGTEN-ANDEN formally applies for membership, to take steps to allow its admission.
.Concerning the allegation that the MECD does not allow the check-off of union dues from members of the complainant organization, the Committee notes with interest the Government s statement that in April  the opening of a check-off code for CGTEN ANDEN was authorized and that any duly constituted trade union in the education sector may access the codes in order to receive its respective union dues as laid down by section  of the Labour Code. The Committee hopes that CGTEN-ANDEN will be able to receive its members' union dues in the near future and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.With respect to the allegations concerning statements by the Ministry of Labour and the MECD that a strike in the sector would be illegal, the Committee notes the Government s statement that the right to strike of workers and their organizations constitutes one of the fundamental means at their disposal for promoting and defending their interests, but that a distinction must be made between demonstrations with purely union aims and demonstrations for other purposes, such as criticising the Government s economic and social policy. The Committee recalls in this respect that organizations responsible for defending workers' socio-economic and occupational interests should be able to use strike action to support their position in the search for solutions to problems posed by major social and economic policy trends which have a direct impact on their members and on workers in general, in particular as regards employment, social protection and standards of living [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.With regard to the allegations concerning the non-observance of a collective agreement in the teaching sector with respect to the payment of performance-related pay, the right to a  zone allowance' and other benefits, and to the allegation that the MECD refuses to start negotiations claiming that the budget has not been approved, the Committee notes with interest the Government s statement that CGTEN-ANDEN and other trade unions in the sector have concluded a collective agreement for - which guarantees economic, social and employment-related improvements for education workers. Taking this information into account, the Committee will not make any further examination of these allegations.
.Finally, with respect to the allegations concerning the written orders from the MECD to educational establishments to bar entry to CGTEN-ANDEN leaders, the Committee observes that the Government has not communicated its",1,2004,Nicaragua
36,"observations in this respect. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that CGTEN-ANDEN officials can have access to educational establishments in the context of the exercise of their union duties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed: () on the work situation of union leader Mr. Julio Jimmy Hernndez Paisano (specifically, whether he has been dismissed for dereliction of duty) and on whether he has lodged an appeal in this respect; and () on the result of the appeal made by union leader Mr. Norlan Jos Toruo Araz against the administrative decision to authorize the termination of his contract. In addition, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation in relation to the work situation of union official Mr. Jos Ismael Rodrguez Soto, with respect to whom it was also alleged that the termination of his contract had been requested, and to keep it informed in this respect.(b) With regard to the allegation that union leader Mr. Manuel Sebastin Mendieta Martnez was the victim of anti-union persecution, having had a person assigned to watch his movements, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to carry out an investigation into these allegations and to send its observations in this respect.(c) As regards the alleged failure to implement judicial orders for the reinstatement of union officials and the payment of outstanding wages (the complainant organization refers by name to the officials concerned), the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the union officials named above by the complainant organization may opt freely for the implementation of the judicial decision or to accept the said indemnity. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(d) With regard to the allegation concerning the Government s refusal to allow CGTEN-ANDEN to participate in the National Education Commission, the Committee requests the Government, if CGTEN-ANDEN formally applies for membership, to take steps to allow its admission.(e) With respect to the allegations concerning the written orders from the MECD to educational establishments to bar entry to CGTEN-ANDEN leaders, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that CGTEN-ANDEN officials can have access to educational establishments in the context of the exercise of their union duties. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(f) Concerning the alleged preferential treatment of certain unions by the MECD, providing office facilities and other benefits such as the use of telephones in return for supporting the Government, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee that, in compliance with the undertaking mentioned above, the complainant organization may enjoy the same benefits as the other unions of the sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.(g) As regards the allegations concerning the refusal of the MECD to grant paid union leave to officials of the complainant organization, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that, in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement, the officials of the complainant organization can avail themselves of paid union leave. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2004,Nicaragua
37,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Jos Benito Escobar Workers' Trade Union Confederation (CST-JBE), dated  November . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  November , the CST-JBE states that, as a consequence of the non-compliance of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len with a collective agreement which entered into force in , on  June  the Trade Union of Workers of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len (SITRADEL) presented a list of demands to the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of the Department of Len with the aim of activating a revision procedure for the agreement.
.The complainant organization adds that the administrative authority acknowledged SITRADEL as representing the workers and appointed a Counsel for Conciliation. The two parties were subsequently summoned to a conciliation hearing on  August . Six conciliation sessions were held on  September . SITRADEL requested the Minster of Labour to appoint a new Counsel for Conciliation, as the existing Counsel had proven to be biased towards the employer. A new Counsel for Conciliation was appointed and a further nine conciliation sessions were held. The complainant organization states that the employer was not present at the last few meetings, and, following a request from SITRADEL, the new Counsel for Conciliation declared the Municipality of Len to be in default for not having attended sessions Nos. ,  and  of the negotiations regarding the list of demands.
.The complainant organization states that, upon receiving notice that it had been found to be in default, the Municipality of Len submitted an application on  September  requesting the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation to appoint a new conciliator and to transfer the bargaining procedure to the city of Managua. The Departmental Labour Inspector for the city of Len turned down the request and SITRADEL requested the Minister of Labour to appoint a Chair for a Strike Council.
.The complainant organization alleges that the Directorate for Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation did exceed its mandate in unilaterally proceeding to dismiss the Counsel for Conciliation. According to the complainant organization, only the Minister of Labour who had appointed the Counsel for Conciliation could reverse her appointment.
.The complainant organization states that the bargaining procedure in question went on for five months, breaking the time limit set down in legislation ( days extendable by a further eight days). The complainant organization states that this occurred as a consequence of the difficulties created by the employer and the complacent attitude adopted by the Ministry of Labour. According to the complainant organization, the employer failed to attend three sessions and attended four others without displaying any willingness to continue with the bargaining procedure. Finally, the complainant organization states that, in an effort to avoid having to appoint a Chair for a Strike Council, the Ministry of Labour failed to deal correctly with the bargaining procedure, the relevant request has been made on seven occasions and the administrative authority has so far failed to rule with regard to this.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government states that the bargaining procedure involving SITRADEL and the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len was conducted in accordance with the labour laws currently in force. The Government states that SITRADEL presented a list of demands to the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of the city of Len and Chinandega, requesting that the collective agreement signed on  July  be revised. The said list was accompanied by complaints of non-compliance with the labour standards contained in the aforementioned collective agreement and in particular with regard to methods of payment for the normal working day, overtime, social benefits and wages. As to this issue, article  of the Labour Code states that  the collective agreement shall be revised before its validity expires at the request of one of the parties, if there are substantial changes to the social and economic conditions of the company or the country that make this advisable' 
.The Government states that the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Len issued a decision in which it admits the list of demands that was submitted and appoints a Counsel for Conciliation, to whom proceedings were transferred so that negotiations could be initiated. On  June , the Directorate for Conciliation and Trade Union Associations for Len and Chinandega ordered that the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len be informed and also ordered the appointment of a negotiating committee within  hours, in accordance with the terms of article  of the Labour Code, whilst at the same time SITRADEL submitted an application in which it appointed its negotiating committee. On  August , the Counsel for Conciliation confirmed the negotiating committees of both parties and set the first hearing for Monday,  August , both parties being informed of this decision.
.The Government states that during the first hearing both parties were reminded that although differences might arise during the process, they should be discussed in a cordial and harmonious manner, with the Ministry of Labour ensuring that any subsequent agreement between the parties did not in any way infringe the minimum guarantees established in the Labour Code. The two parties set out convergence criteria regarding the spirit of the negotiations and had it recorded in the minutes that they would revise fully the points that made up the list of demands whilst agreeing on a timetable for meetings. The Government states that this is not a question of a dispute, as none of the grounds established in article  of the Labour Code apply.
.The Government states that  meetings took place in total and that subsequently the parties participated in a session with the Minister of Labour.
.As to the appointment of conciliators for the bargaining procedure, the Government states that, on  September , the Directorate for Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation of Managua ordered that all proceedings related to the case be transferred to a lawyer, Irella Esther Garca Guilln, in her capacity as ad hoc conciliator regarding the list of demands submitted by SITRADEL. The parties were also summoned for a hearing on Wednesday,  October  and a lawyer, Liduvina Molinares Canelo was appointed as Counsel for Conciliation.
.The Government states that the Ministry of Labour s actions with regard to the appointment of public servants for the bargaining procedure regarding the revision of the collective agreement with the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len, were strictly in accordance with the existing instruments. The Government adds that although the Minister is involved in the decision-making process at the highest level and has the legal authority to exercise authority over those departments and public servants within his Ministry, it is equally the case that the same legislation is clear when it states that these powers fall within the scope of his authority; that is to say, faced with the dilemma of having two general directorates at the same level in the hierarchy, a level at which they cannot and should not interfere in one another s particular field. It is the Minister who has the authority over their duties and departments and who, in the end, has the power to make the final decision in such disputes. Nevertheless, despite having the legal authority to appoint a labour inspector as an ad hoc conciliator, with regard to the scope of duties and authority, this automatically appointed ad hoc conciliator remains directly under the control of the Directorate for Collective Bargaining and Conciliation as it is the only competent authority with jurisdiction over the signing and revision of collective agreements. To proceed in any other manner would be to infringe the law set down in the Labour Code, known as the  law on constituting a Strike Council' 
.The Government adds that on  October , the  Salvador Espinoza' Trade Union for the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len (SITRALSE) submitted an application in which it requested that it be considered a full party to the negotiating committee. On  October , the Directorate for Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation of Managua issued the following decision:  the  alvador Espinoza' Trade Union for the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len, SITRALSE Trade Union, is considered to be one of the parties to the negotiations regarding the list of demands concerning the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len'  This action led to a dispute between the trade unions with regard to the participation of the trade union SITRALSE in the negotiations. The trade union SITRADEL maintains that it refuses to negotiate jointly with SITRALSE. On  October , SITRALSE submitted an application in which it requests that the Directorate for Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation should issue a",-1,2003,Nicaragua
38,"decision on the parties participating in the negotiations as soon as possible.
.The Government states that under no circumstances can, or indeed should, a duly established trade union organization with legal identity be refused the right to collective bargaining. The status of the trade union organization is always assessed once the process has moved ahead, that is to say, when no list of demands has been consolidated by the trade union organizations due to begin the bargaining procedure and so as not to delay the negotiations, the trade union organization which was the most recent in becoming a signatory to the action is accepted, which was not the case with the trade union organization SITRALSE. The Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len has expressed its willingness to continue the bargaining procedure with the existing trade unions within the Municipality of Len. However, the Mayor s Office states that until the trade unions resolve the situation, they will not be permitted to sit at the negotiating table.
.The Government adds that on  August , the Mayor of Len requested that he be excused from the upcoming hearings on the negotiations, given that he had been summoned by the Minister of Labour on the same day as the meeting. On  September , the Mayor of Len stated that on  September of the same year he sent an application to the Minister of Labour in which he requested that the negotiations concerning the list of demands related to the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len be transferred to the central administration and dealt with by a conciliator from the Ministry of Labour in Managua. On  September  the employer was ruled to be in default. On  September , SITRADEL, taking account of the default ruling, requested that the dossier be transferred to the Ministry of Labour in Managua for the relevant legal proceedings and the appointment of a Chair of a Strike Council.
.The Government states that the decision issued by the ad hoc conciliator declaring the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len to be in default was revoked for being unjustified. The Government states that it is regrettable that although in this case the negotiating procedure has not been exhausted, it has been interrupted owing to a prevailing negative position regarding the incorporation of another organization affiliated to the same trade union federation. The Ministry of Labour recognizes that the spirit and willingness of the parties must always prevail in the negotiations this being the reason behind the process in the first place. Consequently, the Ministry urges those involved in the process to put aside their differences and continue negotiating.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organization alleges that: () as a consequence of the non-compliance of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len with a collective agreement which entered into force in , on  June  the Trade Union of Workers of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len (SITRADEL) presented a list of demands to the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of the Department of Len with the aim of activating the revision procedure for the agreement; () the bargaining procedure in question went on for five months, breaking the time limit set down in legislation ( days extendable by a further eight days); () the delays were due to the attitude displayed by the employer which failed to attend several meetings (and was even declared to be in default by a conciliator) and attended meetings but was unwilling to continue with negotiations; and () the Ministry of Labour failed to deal correctly with the bargaining procedure and failed to initiate the appointment process of a Chairperson at the Strike Tribunal, as requested by the complainant organization.
.In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government states that: (i) the bargaining procedure between the Trade Union of Workers of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len (SITRADEL) and the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len was carried out in accordance with the existing labour laws; (ii) with regard to the conciliators appointed as a part of the process of revising the collective agreement, the administrative authority s actions were strictly in accordance with the instruments in force at that time; (iii) on  October , the  Salvador Espinoza' Trade Union for the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len (SITRALSE) requested that it be allowed to participate in the bargaining procedure, leading to a dispute with the trade union organization SITRADEL which refuses to negotiate jointly with SITRALSE; (iv) the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len has expressed its willingness to continue the negotiating process. However, the Mayor s Office states that until the trade unions resolve the situation they will not be permitted to come to the negotiating table; (v) the default ruling was revoked; and (vi) it is regrettable that the bargaining procedure should have been interrupted owing to a prevailing negative position regarding the incorporation of another trade union organization.
.In this context, the Committee notes that for different reasons, the process of revising the collective agreement concluded between the trade union organization SITRADEL and the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len has continued for an overly long period and the timetable envisaged in legislation has not been respected. In this respect, the Committee stresses  ...the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of the harmonious development of labour relations' and that  the principle that both employers and trade unions should negotiate in good faith and make efforts to reach an agreement means that any unjustified delay in the holding of negotiations should be avoided' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ].
.Under the circumstances, the Committee requests the Government, taking into account the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Nicaragua, to encourage the parties to conclude a new collective agreement to regulate the working conditions of the workers of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len as soon as possible.
.Finally, as to the Government s declaration on the delay affecting the bargaining procedure which was caused by a dispute between SITRADEL and another trade union organization (SITRALSE) which wishes to participate in the negotiation of the agreement, the Committee notes that the Nicaraguan Labour Code allows for the participation of more than one workers' organization and does not simply grant exclusive bargaining rights to the most representative organization. The Committee therefore considers that any dispute between workers' organizations over participation in a bargaining procedure should be resolved by an impartial arbitrator chosen by the parties, or by the courts.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government, taking into account the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Nicaragua, to encourage the parties to conclude a new collective agreement to regulate the working conditions of the workers of the Mayor s Office of the Municipality of Len as soon as possible.(b) The Committee considers that any dispute between workers' organizations over participation in a bargaining procedure should be resolved by an impartial arbitrator chosen by the parties, or by the courts.",1,2003,Nicaragua
39,".In its previous examination of the case, at its March  meeting, the Committee indicated that it understood that the reason for cancelling the registration of the  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union of the company Hansae Nicaragua SA (STIS), was the reduction in the minimum number of workers needed to form a trade union (section  of the Labour Code). In this regard, the Committee indicated that it could not rule out that the  requests to leave the union and the resignations of union members from the enterprise were a result of anti-union activity. The Committee therefore requested the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that an investigation was carried out to determine the reasons behind the members leaving the union and resigning, which had led to the cancellation of the union s registration, and to keep it informed in this regard. Furthermore, the Committee requested the Government to report on the reason for the dismissal of the union leader Ms Zoila Cceres Rodrguez and to send the corresponding decisions, as well as to indicate whether the union leader in question had lodged an appeal against the decision of the General Labour Inspectorate before the judicial authority and, finally, it requested the Government to send the rulings handed down and information concerning the alleged threats against trade unionists Ms Marjorie Sequeira and Ms Johana Rodrguez [see th Report, paras ' ].
.In its communication of  June , the Government indicates that freedom of association is a constitutional right in Nicaragua for individuals who organize freely and peacefully for the defence of their trade union interests. Article  of the political Constitution establishes that right and provides that:  There is full freedom of association in Nicaragua. Workers shall organize voluntarily in trade unions and trade unions may be established in accordance with the law. No worker shall be obliged to belong to a particular trade union or withdraw from a trade union to which he or she belongs. Full trade union autonomy shall be recognized and trade union immunity shall be respected. In line with the Constitution, section  of the Labour Code provides that:  Provided that it is through lawful means and for lawful purposes, trade unions shall have the right to: (a) draw up their constitutions and rules in full freedom; (b) elect their representatives in full freedom; (c) organize their administration and activities; and (d) formulate their programmes.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.With regard to the status of the Idalia Silva Workers' Trade Union of the company Hansae Nicaragua SA, the Government indicates that the department of trade union associations received a total of  copies of requests to leave the union and six copies of requests from members of that union to leave their posts at the company Hansae Nicaragua SA. It should be mentioned that it is on record that the ruling of the Court of First Instance which gave rise to the dissolution of the trade union was not appealed by the injured party, therewith consenting with the content of the ruling. It is not appropriate to speculate about why the injured party did not exercise its right to appeal. However, what is important in this case is to point out that the authorities in charge of the Ministry of Labour since  January  have not produced any requests to leave any trade union organizations that were either registered or in the process of being registered. As long as the current administration is in charge of the Ministry of Labour, there will not be a situation ' like has not been a situation ' giving rise to requests to leave a trade union.
.In relation to paragraph  of the Committee s th Report, the Government refers to Resolution No. - (which states that the reasons for the dismissal were absence from work and forgery of a medical certificate relating to that absence; see copy attached to its reply) concerning the case of Ms Zoila Cceres Rodrguez, which contains the reasons for her dismissal. On  November , Ms Cceres Rodrguez lodged an appeal against the resolution authorizing the cancellation of her employment contract. On  November , the Regional Labour Inspectorate for the Agribusiness Sector allowed the appeal lodged by Ms Cceres Rodrguez. On  December , the General Labour Inspectorate issued Resolution No. - rejecting the appeal lodged by Ms Cceres Rodrguez, thereby upholding the resolution authorizing her dismissal. According to the labour legislation, the resolution issued by the General Labour Inspectorate exhausts the administrative channels, leaving the injured party with two options: () file an action for protection of constitutional rights (amparo), or () institute legal proceedings. It is not known whether Ms Cceres Rodrguez made use of these options.
.With regard to paragraph  of the th Report concerning the ruling handed down and information requested concerning the alleged threats against trade unionists Ms Marjorie Sequeira and Ms Johana Rodrguez, the Government indicates that it requested information from the Third Local Criminal Court of Managua, which issued a report communicated to the Committee. The report indicates that the case was settled by means of a mediation procedure in which the parties participated at the appropriate time and, since the ruling was considered final, the case has been closed.
.The Committee notes this information. In particular, the Committee notes that the legal proceedings relating to alleged threats against trade unionists Ms Marjorie Sequeira and Ms Johana Rodrguez were closed on account of a mediation procedure conducted by the parties. It also notes the reasons for the dismissal of the trade union leader Ms Zoila Cceres Rodrguez (forgery of medical documents) and that the appeal lodged by that trade union leader was rejected. Moreover, with regard to the allegations relating to the dissolution of the Idalia Silva Workers' Trade Union of the company Hansae de Nicaragua SA, by court ruling, taking into account the information provided by the Government and, in particular, that the court ruling ordering the dissolution was not appealed by the workers and that it concerns allegations made in , the Committee shall not continue to examine these allegations.
.On its last examination of the case, at its November  meeting, the Committee noted that the complainant (National Federation of  Heroes and Martyrs' Trade Unions of the Textile, Clothing, Leather and Footwear Industry (FNSHM)) stated with regard to the  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union (STIS) in the company Hansae Nicaragua SA in the export processing zone that the Second Labour Court of Managua had handed down a ruling ordering that the case concerning dissolution of the trade union be shelved since neither of the parties had expedited the proceedings, and that a subsequent ruling ordered the dissolution of the trade union, followed by cancellation of the trade union s registration by the Ministry of Labour (notified on  November ) and pointed out the contradiction between the two judicial decisions, which also violate the principle of double jeopardy. Moreover, the General Secretary of the trade union, Ruth Meza Orozco, was dismissed on  December  on grounds that she was no longer covered by trade union immunity, and then Zoila Cceres, Secretary of the organization, was also dismissed. The Committee requested the Government to reply without delay to that additional information. Also, the Committee requested the Government to send the rulings handed down and information concerning the alleged threats against Marjorie Sequeiro and Johana Rodrguez [see rd Report, paras ' ].
.In its communication of  September , the Government stated with regard to the state of the STIS in the company Hansae Nicaragua SA, that on  September , the trade union held an extraordinary general assembly, in which it restructured its committee, which was registered including a list of  signatures of participating members. On  March , in an extraordinary general assembly, the trade union again restructured its committee, including a list of  signatures. On  July , the trade union held an extraordinary general assembly in which it elected to change its committee, which was then registered. In the meantime, the Department of Trade Union Associations received a total of  copies of requests to leave the union and six copies of requests from members of that union to leave their posts at the company Hansae Nicaragua SA. The Government adds that, in accordance with case No.  and ruling No.  of the Second District Labour Court of  July , it was decided, based on articles ,  and  of the Labour Code: () to go ahead with the dissolution of the STIS in the company Hansae Nicaragua SA, as requested by the general legal representative of the company Hansae Nicaragua SA; () once the ruling was final, to serve an official notice to the Department of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour. The ruling was not appealed and was referred for advice to the Managua District Court of Appeal. In ruling No. / of  October , the",1,2003,Nicaragua
40,"Labour Tribunal of the Managua District Court of Appeal ruled, in accordance with articles ,  and  of the Labour Code, to uphold the ruling that had been referred for advice to the Second Labour Judge of the Managua District. On  December , the Second Labour Judge of the Managua District ordered the Department of Trade Union Associations to cancel the STIS in the company Hansae Nicaragua SA, based on the aforementioned rulings. In compliance with the ruling, the Department of Trade Union Associations proceeded to remove the trade union from the trade unions' register maintained by the Department. The Committee notes this information and understands that the reason for cancelling the registration was the reduction in the minimum number of workers needed to form a trade union (article  of the Labour Code). In this regard, the Committee cannot rule out that the  requests to leave the union and the resignations of union members from the enterprise were a result of anti-union activity. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures so that an investigation is carried out to determine the reasons behind the members leaving the union and resigning, which led to the cancellation of the union registration, and to keep it informed in this regard.
.With regard to the alleged dismissal of Ruth Meza Orozco, the Government notes that the Regional Labour Inspectorate for the Agribusiness Sector had no record of the alleged cancellation of Ruth Meza Orozco s contract, in her capacity as General Secretary of the STIS, as mentioned in the complaint. With regard to the situation of Zoila Cceres Rodrguez, the Government reports that on  October , the Regional Labour Inspectorate for the Agribusiness Sector received a request from the human resources manager and the general legal representative of the company Hansae Nicaragua SA to cancel her contract as an employee and as the Secretary of the organization, based on articles  and  of the current Labour Code, Act No. . On  October  the Regional Labour Inspectorate for the Agribusiness Sector issued an official notice to all parties to appear for conciliatory proceedings. On  October , Ms Cceres Rodrguez appeared and signed the request. On  October the trial began. On  November , in resolution No. -, the Regional Labour Inspectorate for the Agribusiness Sector approved the request for dismissal made by the human resources manager and the general legal representative of the company Hansae Nicaragua SA, and notified both parties on  November . Zoila Cceres Rodrguez appealed this measure on  November . On  November , the Regional Labour Inspectorate for the Agribusiness Sector received the appeal and on  December , the General Labour Inspectorate issued resolution No. - which rejected the appeal. The Committee takes note of this information and requests the Government to report on the reason for the dismissal of the union official Zoila Cceres Rodrguez and to send in the corresponding resolutions, as well as to indicate whether the official in question appealed the decision of the General Labour Inspectorate before the judicial authority.
.Lastly, the Committee again requests the Government to send the rulings handed down and information concerning the alleged threats against union members Marjorie Sequeiro and Johana Rodrguez.
.At its last examination of the case, at its November  meeting, the Committee formulated the following recommendations [see th Report, para. ]:(a) As regards the judicial proceedings initiated on the basis of a request for the dissolution of the trade union  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union (STIS), the Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings, and emphasizes that allowing the representatives of a company to request the dissolution of a union may give rise to acts of interference by the employer.(b) As regards the alleged death threats against trade unionists Marjorie Sequeira and Johana Rodrguez, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures adopted by the judicial authority following the police inquiry.
.In its communication of  January , the complainant (National Federation of  Heroes and Martyrs' Trade Unions of the Textile, Clothing, Leather and Footwear Industry (FNSHM)) stated with regard to the  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union (STIS) in the export processing zone that the Second Labour Court of Managua handed down a ruling ordering that the case concerning dissolution of the trade union be shelved since neither of the parties had expedited the proceedings, and a subsequent ruling ordering the dissolution of the trade union, followed by cancellation of the trade union s registration by the Ministry of Labour (notified on  November ). The complainant points out the contradiction between the two judicial decisions, which also violate the principle of double jeopardy. Moreover, the general secretary of the trade union, Ruth Meza Orozco, was dismissed on  December  on grounds that she was no longer covered by trade union immunity, followed by Zoila Cceres, secretary of the organization.
.The Committee requests the Government to reply without delay to the additional information sent by the complainant, and to the Committee s previous recommendations. The Committee regrets the Government s delay in sending this information and requests it in particular to send the rulings handed down and information concerning the alleged threats against Marjorie Sequeira and Johana Rodrguez, the dissolution of the STIS and the dismissal of trade union officials Ruth Meza Orozco and Zoila Cceres.
.At its meeting in March , the Committee examined this case and presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see rd Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in March ].
.The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  May .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In view of the preceding conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to adopt the following recommendations:(a) As regards the judicial proceedings initiated on the basis of a request for the dissolution of the trade union  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union (STIS), the Committee once again requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of these proceedings, and emphasizes that allowing the representatives of a company to request the dissolution of a union may give rise to acts of interference by the employer.(b) As regards the alleged death threats against trade unionists Marjorie Sequeira and Johana Rodrguez, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures adopted by the judicial authority following the police inquiry.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Federation of  Heroes and Martyrs' Trade Unions of the Textile, Clothing, Leather and Footwear Industry (FNSHM) dated  May . This organization sent additional information in the communication of  July . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  September .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  May and  July , the National Federation of  Heroes and Martyrs' Trade Unions of the Textile, Clothing, Leather and Footwear Industry (FNSHM) refers to anti-union practices at the Hansae de Nicaragua S.A. export processing zone enterprise against the  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union (STIS) (affiliated to the Sandista Workers' Confederation). More specifically, the complainant alleges that shortly after the establishment of this trade union on  July , the enterprise concluded a collective agreement on  July  with the Democratic Trade Union of Workers at Hansae de Nicaragua S.A. (SDTH); that this trade union is affiliated to the Autonomous Confederation of Nicaraguan Workers (which is financially supported by the export processing zone enterprises) and has close links to the enterprise; in fact, its executive committee was granted a four-month extension by the Ministry of Labour following the expiry date of its one-year term. According to the complainant, the collective agreement that was concluded contained clauses that were damaging to workers in terms of dismissals and overtime, and negotiations with STIS were put aside; the Ministry of Labour authorized this collective agreement. The enterprise refuses to negotiate with STIS despite having been called to the Ministry of Labour for this purpose.
.On the other hand, the enterprise, and subsequently four workers and an adviser paid by the enterprise, requested the authorities to dissolve STIS and the corresponding proceedings were initiated. In this context, the Ministry of Labour refused to register the reorganization of the STIS executive committee and suspended the collective bargaining process.
.The complainant also alleges that trade unionists Ms. Marjorie Sequeira and Ms. Johana Rodrguez filed a complaint on  August  with the state police and the competent court regarding death threats issued by persons linked to the enterprise s administration (the plant manager and a former employee) who attempted to make them leave STIS.
.Furthermore, the",1,2003,Nicaragua
41,"Ministry of Labour approved the internal regulations of the enterprise on  August  without taking into account the involvement of trade union officers or workers. In March , the Labour Inspectorate conducted an inspection which involved only the SDTH which has close links with the employer.
.In its communication of  September , the Government refers to two requests to cancel the registration of the  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union (STIS) and its executive committee; the Ministry of Labour stated that it was incompetent to deal with these requests and ordered the file on this case to be closed. The Government indicates that when STIS requested the registration of the reorganization of its executive committee on  October , the Directorate for Trade Union Associations rejected the request owing to the legal proceedings under way against STIS (relating to the cancellation of the registration of the trade union and its committee). On  October, the appeal against this decision was rejected, but, following a new appeal, the Directorate for Trade Union Associations notified STIS on  January  that the registration of the committee s new structure had been processed.
.The Government states that, contrary to the allegations, the Directorate for Trade Union Associations only extended the SDTH executive committee for a period of one month (from  July to  August ), and that this had been at the request of the trade union.
.As regards the alleged death threats against STIS officers at the Hansae de Nicaragua S.A. enterprise, the Government states that Ms. Marjorie Sequeira filed a complaint with the state police in district No.  against Mr. Csar Jarqun Reyes and Mr. Orlando Vallecillo for having issued death threats. On  September , the case was referred to the Third Local Criminal Court of Managua.
.With reference to the signing of the internal regulations without the involvement of STIS officers, the Government indicates that Hansae de Nicaragua S.A. enterprise submitted a draft of the disciplinary internal regulations to the Labour Inspectorate for them to be duly revised and approved. The Inspectorate subsequently issued a document to inform workers that they had  hours to put forward any comments they saw fit on the draft internal regulations submitted by the employer. This was also notified to the General Secretary of SDTH who appeared and provided the trade union s comments. Once the draft had been revised and corrected accordingly, the Inspectorate proceeded to authorize the internal regulations on  August . The STIS was not notified of the draft because this trade union had still not been established.
.The Government rejects the allegation that STIS was excluded from the comprehensive labour inspection conducted at the enterprise in March . In fact, the document containing the observed infractions and the corrective measures to be taken within specific deadlines was signed by the General Secretary of STIS and by a representative of the other trade union (SDTH).
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant alleges that: () the Hansae de Nicaragua S.A. enterprise excluded and continues to exclude the  Idalia Silva' Workers' Trade Union (STIS) from collective bargaining and concluded a collective agreement with the SDTH trade union, which has close links to the employer, containing clauses that were damaging to workers, shortly after the establishment of STIS; () the enterprise, and subsequently four workers and an adviser paid by the enterprise, requested the dissolution of STIS, and proceedings are under way in this respect, which led the Ministry of Labour to refuse to register the reorganization of the STIS executive committee and to suspend the collective bargaining process with STIS; () death threats were made against two trade unionists; () trade union officers were not involved in the procedure for approving the internal regulations of the enterprise; and () a labour inspection was conducted with the participation of only the SDTH trade union. The Committee considered that information was lacking on this case. In particular, the Committee requests the Government to approach the employers' organizations concerned by the questions at issue, with a view to having at its disposal the views of the enterprise concerned.
.Regarding the allegation that a collective agreement was concluded, without the involvement of STIS, containing clauses that were damaging to workers, with a trade union that has close links to the employer, the Committee observes that the complainant has not sent a signed copy of the collective agreement, and that the Committee is unable to assess the clauses contained in this agreement. Furthermore, the annexes provided by the complainant clearly show that STIS requested the possibility of bargaining jointly with the other trade union. Furthermore, it emerges from the documentation sent by the complainant that legislation allows for the signing of a second collective agreement with STIS, and that the other trade union has made various demands similar to those of STIS. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the collective agreement in question, so as to be able to pronounce itself in this respect.
.With reference to the request made by the enterprise, and subsequently by four workers, for the dissolution of STIS, the Committee notes that the Government confirms that this issue (the cancellation of the trade union s registration) was submitted to the judicial authority, observes that STIS is still operational, and requests the Government to send the rulings handed down in the two proceedings under way. The Committee regrets that the administrative authority used this situation to refuse to register the reorganization of the STIS executive committee for several months (as emerges from the allegations and the Government s statements) and (according to the complainant) to suspend the collective bargaining process initiated by STIS. Nonetheless, the Committee observes that, following a second appeal, the reorganization of the STIS executive committee was registered. The Committee regrets the delay in registration of the executive committee due to an initial refusal and requests the Government to refrain from interfering in trade union affairs in the future.
.As regards the alleged death threats against trade unionists Ms. Marjorie Sequeira and Ms. Johana Rodrguez so that they would leave the trade union, the Committee notes the Government s statements, according to which Ms. Marjorie Sequeira filed a complaint with the national police, which referred the complaint to the judicial authority. Furthermore, the Committee observes that the annexes of the complaint include a mediation agreement between the two trade unionists and the two persons accused of issuing the threats. In this agreement the latter agrees that they will not visit the trade unionists in question or cause them any future problems, thereby bringing the case to a close. It requests the Government to take the necessary measures to institute an independent investigation in this respect and, if the allegations are found to be true, to punish the guilty parties and immediately provide adequate protection to the trade unionists in question. The Committee condemns these threats and requests the Government to ensure that all workplaces and especially the export processing zone remain free from violent acts against trade unionists.
.Lastly, the Committee notes the Government s statements rejecting the idea that STIS was excluded from the labour inspection conducted at the enterprise in March , and points out that the General Secretary of this trade union signed the inspection document. Furthermore, the Committee notes that STIS could not have been consulted (as was not the case with SDTH) when drawing up the internal regulations of the enterprise, since at this point in time it had still not been established.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee requests the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee considered that information was lacking on this case. In particular, the Committee requests the Government to approach the employers' organizations concerned by the questions at issue, with a view to having at its disposal the views of the enterprise concerned.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the two proceedings under way in which the cancellation of the registration of STIS was requested. Moreover the Committee regrets the delay in the registration of the STIS executive committee due to an initial refusal and requests the Government to refrain from interfering in trade union affairs in the future.(c) The Committee condemns the death threats against trade unionists Ms. Marjorie Sequeira and Ms. Johana Rodrguez and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to institute an independent investigation in this respect and, if the allegations are found to be true, to punish the guilty parties and immediately provide adequate protection to the trade unionists in question.(d) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that all workplaces and especially the export processing zone remain free from violent acts against trade unionists.(e) With regard to allegations that a collective agreement, containing clauses that were damaging to workers, was concluded with a trade union that has close links with the employer, the Committee requests the Government to send a copy of the collective",1,2003,Nicaragua
42,agreement in question so as to be able to pronounce itself in this respect.,1,2003,Nicaragua
43,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting [see th Report, paras.  to ] and made the following recommendations:  As regards the dismissal of a number of trade union officials, observing that the dismissals of Mr. Edwin Garca and Ms. Blanca Alejandrina Aruz took place in  and , the Committee deplores the delay in the judicial proceedings and trusts that if the judicial authority confirms the anti-trade union character of those dismissals, both officials will be reinstated without delay and without loss of pay. If the judicial authority determines that reinstatement is not possible, both officials should be fully compensated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed thereof. The Committee further requests the Government to inform it if Ms. Surez was in fact reinstated in her post.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:
.In a communication dated  May , the Government rejects the Committee s view about the judicial proceedings provided for by the law. There has been no delay; these proceedings are a matter for the Nicaraguan judicial authorities, which are competent to carry out this work. On the other hand, as regards the dismissals of Edwin Garca and Blanca Alejandrina Aruz, which took place in  and  respectively, the Government notes that it has had no information from the complainant, which is actively promoting the case before the labour courts. The Committee regrets that despite the time that has passed, the judicial authorities have not made a ruling on these dismissals. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the judicial proceedings. The Committee also once again requests the Government to inform it if Ms. Surez was in fact reinstated in her post.
. As regards the alleged restrictions on collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure in the future the implementation of the obligation to encourage and promote collective bargaining provided in Article  of Convention No.  and observance of the principle of good faith in collective bargaining. The Committee recalls to the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is available in this regard.' The Government states that there are no obstacles to the negotiation of a collective agreement between a trade union and an employer or employers' organization. In Nicaragua, employers and workers have mechanisms of conciliation and mediation available to them to solve any socio-economic and legal disputes, whether individual or collective, which may arise regarding labour relations, with a view to solving socio-economic disputes through the conclusion or revision of collective agreements. The Ministry of Labour Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation analyses, approves and registers collective agreements; the Government thanks the Committee for its offer of technical assistance. The Committee takes note of this information.
. As regards the allegation concerning the conclusion of a collective agreement with a trade union financed by the employer, the Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation in this respect and to keep it informed of the result, in particular as regards the representative character or otherwise of the Roo Sing Garment Co. Democratic Workers' Union.' In this regard the Government reports that the Roo Sing Garment Co. Democratic Workers' Union is representative, and legally enjoys trade union rights in accordance with the law. There is no trade union organization financed by the employer. The Committee takes note of this information.
. As regards the proceedings for slander and libel initiated against trade union officials and members, the Committee requests the Government to send information on the criminal proceedings initiated against the members of the trade union s executive board and other workers and hopes that, since the administrative authority has confirmed that there had indeed been acts of sexual harassment, the dismissals will be cancelled and the criminal proceedings against the trade unionists declared inadmissible.' In this regard the Government indicates that in matters regarding the criminal proceedings for slander and libel against Eddy Reyes and against Csar Prez Rodrguez and others, the Ministry of Labour is not a party in that case, and so is not linked to it, and has no jurisdiction in strictly criminal matters. There is no information from the complainant trade union organization about the outcome of this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the progress of the criminal proceedings.
. As regards the alleged drawing up of blacklists, the Committee requests the Government to conduct a thorough and independent investigation into the matter and to keep it informed in this respect.' The Government reports that prior to the installation of an enterprise or enterprises covered by the export processing zones scheme, they are informed of the rights and obligations under national labour law. Ministerial resolutions are binding on both employers (Nicaraguan or foreign) and workers (Nicaraguan or foreign) who settle in Nicaragua. No evidence has been found of the existence of  blacklists' that are detrimental to the rights of workers as laid down in the law or that target members of trade unions in enterprises covered by the export processing zones scheme. The Nicaraguan administrative and judicial authorities do not, under any circumstances, allow this sort of practice, which seriously infringes the rights of workers. The Committee takes note of this information.
.The complaint is set out in a letter from the National Federation of Heroes and Martyrs Trade Unions of the Textiles, Clothing, Leather and Shoe Industry on behalf of the Roo Sing Garment Co. Workers' Union (STERSG) of  May . In a letter of  July , the complainant sent additional information.
.The Government sent its observations in letters of  September and  October  and  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter of  May  the complainant organization begins by stating that, after having to overcome problems with its formation in January , the Roo Sing Garment Co. Workers' Union (STERSG) submitted a list of demands on  April . In May , the Trade Unions Directorate convened the trade unions (STERSG and another trade union called '  January' also active in the company) and the company to begin negotiations. Eight meetings were held in this way and over  per cent of the clauses were negotiated. In June the same year, the company sent a letter requesting suspension of the negotiations because the leadership of the  January union had been contested. The complainant alleges that from that moment, the company in connivance with officials of the Ministry of Labour, set out to contest the STERSG.
.On  June , the STERSG held an extraordinary general meeting to restructure its executive board and elect new negotiators. The documentation was submitted to the Trade Unions Directorate which, on  June, issued a directive stating that certain items must be rectified as they were illegible. Subsequently, on  October of the same year, the Directorate issued resolution No. - in which it decided not to accept the request for restructuring. Two days later, the company sent a letter to the Trade Unions Directorate requesting the negotiations of the list of demands to be archived. Meanwhile, the company had presented a counter-proposal to the list of demands and the STERSG had in turn presented counter-proposals to reach a final agreement and conclude the collective agreement. On  October, the Trade Unions Directorate reiterated its decision to refuse approval of the restructuring of the executive board and ordered the suspension of the other board members. In consequence, it accepted the company s request and ordered the records of the negotiations to be archived. The complainant alleges that the Ministry of Labour ignored article  of the Labour Code which provides that  when trade union leaders are involved in negotiations over an industrial dispute and their term of office expire, that circumstance shall not be grounds for not recognizing their representative capacity'  On  October, the company dismissed the general secretary of the STERSG, Edwin Garca. The court action for reinstatement was heard by the labour court and is now before the Labour Chamber in the Court of Appeal.
.On  March , elections were held in the STERSG for new trade union officers at an extraordinary general meeting. On the following day, the company unjustly dismissed the elected trade union officers, Blanca Alejandrina Aruz, minutes and agreements secretary, Wilfredo Genaro Palacios, labour affairs secretary, and Johanela Conde Morales, women s secretary (who in addition was pregnant at the time). Actions for reinstatement were initiated in the labour courts. Subsequently, two of them dropped their actions. In the case of Blanca Alejandrina Aruz, the labour judge ordered her reinstatement but the company refused to comply. The case is currently before the Court of Appeal.
.The complainant alleges that on  February , the company signed a collective agreement with a pro-management trade union affiliated to the (autonomous) Nicaraguan Workers'",1,2003,Nicaragua
44,"Federation (CTN) based in the Ministry of Labour. In this way, the Ministry of Labour and the CTN were able to exert pressure on the STERSG. The complainant points out that the CTN is an organization which receives funds from employers. The help received is intended to isolate, along with Ministry of Labour officials, organizations such as the STERSG which defend the workers' interests.
.The complainant also alleges that, in July , anti-union acts worsened when the manager of the company asked the Ministry of Labour to suspend the STERSG.
.In September ,  workers reported acts of sexual harassment and abuse of their position by company supervisors to the departmental labour inspectorate for the agro-industry sector. Following the inspection that was carried out, the supervisors initiated criminal proceedings for abuse and libel against members of the STERSG executive board and workers who testified against them during the special inspection by the Ministry of Labour. Those concerned are: Csar Prez Rodrguez, Walter Chvez Garca, Walter Prez Canales, Gretchel Surez Martnez, Francisco Rodrguez Alvarado, Adriana Aguirre Traa, Hazel Briones, Paula Pavn, Tania Carazo Rodrguez, Johana Meja Obando, Socorro del Carmen Bello, Martha Lorena Trujillo, Ana Snchez, Xochilt Gonzles, Janneh Balladares and Cenely Benevidez. The complainant reports that the criminal proceedings are continuing, that the company is paying for the supervisors' lawyer and that the majority of these workers have been dismissed.
.On  March , a new executive board of the STERSG was elected, with Ms. Gretchel Surez Martnez as general secretary. On  March the same year, the company informed her that it had decided to suspend her from work with pay. This violation was reported to the departmental labour inspectorate. However, as at the date of submission of the complaint, it had not taken any action in that respect. The general secretary has not been paid her wages for two months.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that after the trade unionists have been dismissed, employers in the free zones draw up blacklists to prevent them being hired by other companies.
.In a letter of  July , the complainant reports that the Labour and Trade Union Affairs Committee in the National Assembly made a public statement in June  condemning violations of the human, labour and trade union rights of workers in free zones by various companies including the Roo Sing Garment Co. The complainant encloses the text of this statement.
.In a letter of  September  the Government states, with respect to the complaint of sexual harassment of workers by two supervisors, that the departmental inspectorate carried out an inspection of the company in September  and that, through several interviews with workers, confirmed the complaint. The inspectorate decided to fine the company the maximum fine of C$, crdobas and ordered the company to discipline those responsible on pain of further sanctions.
.As regards the suspension of Ms. Gretchel Surez Martinez' contract, the Government states that on  March  the company presented a request for individual cancellation of her contract, based on articles (d) and (a), (b) and (d) of the Labour Code and articles , ,  and  of the Company s internal regulations. None of the parties attended the conciliation proceedings. After examining the evidence presented by the parties and verifying that the parties were not undefended, it was found that there were no grounds for cancelling Ms. Surez' contract as the company had not succeeded in proving the grounds invoked. In May the same year, the company entered an appeal which was decided by the Inspectorate General, which fully upheld the decision of the departmental inspectorate for the industry sector.
.In a letter of  March , concerning the dismissal of Mr Edwin Garca, the Government confirms that the reinstatement proceedings are before the labour courts.
.With regard to the case of Blanca Alejandrina Aruz, it states that the case is in progress in the Labour Chamber of the Court of Appeal.
.As regards the negotiation of a collective agreement between a trade union and the company, the Government points out that on  April , the  January union, also belonging to the Roo Sing Garment Co., presented a list of demands. On the following day, the complainant presented another list of demands. Subsequently, in May , the two unions together presented a joint list of demands to the company. In June the same year, the company presented a letter in which it stated that it did not agree with the  January union continuing to participate in the negotiations on the list of demands because it had sought to have that union challenged in the Trade Unions Directorate which had accepted its request. On  June , the company presented a letter to the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation, requesting suspension of the negotiations on the list of demands because the  January union  was not legally constituted and did not have any trade union credentials'  The Government also states that on  June , the STERSG presented a decision of the extraordinary general meeting electing a new executive board in order to obtain the necessary certification. On  September, the STERSG again presented a decision of another meeting held on  June in which it had agreed on a new executive board. On  October , the Trade Unions Directorate decided not to accept the restructuring of the STERSG s executive board. On  October, at . p.m., a further extraordinary general meeting was held to change the executive board, the decision of which was sent to obtain certification. On  October, the company sent a letter requesting the records of the negotiation to be archived taking into account that the STERSG  had lost its representativeness' by virtue of the abovementioned resolution of  October . On  October , the Directorate of Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation issued an order based on that resolution, accepting the company s request and ordering the proceedings to be archived. Subsequently, in February , the Directorate was informed of the conclusion of a collective agreement between the Roo Sing Garment Co. and the Roo Sing Garment Co. Democratic Workers' Union (Nicaragua) with the request that it be registered. The registered agreement was signed on  February  for a period of two years. The agreement covers all the company s workers, irrespective of the trade union to which they belong.
.As regards the alleged request for suspension of the STERSG, the Government states that on  June , the Roo Sing Garment Co. asked the Trade Unions Directorate to undertake an inspection of the STERSG to ascertain whether it satisfied the legal requirements, such as the minimum number of members. In the course of the inspection, the Trade Unions Directorate informed the company, with respect to its request for cancellation of the STERSG s legal personality, that such an action should be addressed to the competent authority, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code.
.Finally, the Government states that no evidence has been found of blacklists of workers or of members of trade unions in companies covered by the free zone scheme. Under no circumstances do the administrative and judicial authorities allow such practices which are a serious violation of workers' rights and the legal framework in which such companies are set up in the country.
.The Committee observes that the present case refers to allegations of a series of anti-trade union acts, in particular: the dismissal of several officials of the Roo Sing Garment Co. Workers' Union (STERSG); refusal by the Roo Sing Garment Co. to comply with a court order to reinstate a trade union leader; negotiation of a collective agreement with a trade union financed by the employer, setting aside the agreement that was being negotiated with STERSG; application for suspension of the STERSG by the company in July ; criminal proceedings against the STERSG executive board for slander and libel, suspension of a trade unionist s wages and drawing up of blacklists of trade union members. The committee observes the existence of a statement by the Labour and Trade Union Affairs Committee of the National Assembly in June  condemning violations of the human, labour and trade union rights of workers in free zones by various companies including the Roo Sing Garment Co.Dismissal of trade union officials
.The Committee notes the allegations concerning the dismissal of trade union official Edwin Garca in October  whose legal proceedings for reinstatement are currently before the Labour Chamber of the Court of Appeal. The Committee also notes that on  March , on the day following their election, the trade union officials Blanca Alejandrina Aruz, Wilfredo Genaro Palacios and Johanela Conde Morales (who was also pregnant at the time) were unjustly dismissed. According to the complainant, the latter two dropped their legal proceedings. In the case brought by Blanca Alejandrina Aruz, although the court ordered her reinstatement, the company refused to comply and the case is currently before the Court of Appeal. The Committee notes that the Government confirms",1,2003,Nicaragua
45,"that the legal proceedings initiated by Mr. Edwin Garca and Ms. Blanca Alejandrina Aruz are now pending in the labour courts and the Labour Chamber of the Court of Appeal, respectively. The Committee also notes that on  March , days after being elected, Ms. Gretchel Surez Martinez, general secretary of the complainant union, was suspended from her post. In this respect, the Government reports that the departmental inspectorate for the industry sector decided not to allow the cancellation of Ms. Surez' contract requested by the company as the company had not succeeded in proving the grounds invoked, a decision that was upheld by the Inspectorate General.
.The Committee emphasizes that the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate if they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed and recalls that the Government is responsible for preventing all acts of anti-trade union discrimination and must ensure that complaints of anti-union discrimination are examined in the framework of national procedures which should be prompt, impartial and considered as such by the parties concerned [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , th edition, paras. -]. Observing that the dismissals of Mr. Edwin Garca and Ms. Blanca Alejandrina Aruz took place in  and , the Committee deplores the delay in the judicial proceedings and trusts that if the judicial authority confirms the anti-trade union character of those dismissals, both officials will be reinstated without delay and without loss of pay. If the judicial authority determines that reinstatement is not possible, both officials should be fully compensated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. The Committee further requests the Government to inform it if Ms. Surez was in fact reinstated in her post.Restrictions on collective bargaining
.The Committee notes that the STERSG, together with the  January trade union, both active in the Roo Sing Garment Co., presented a joint list of demands in May  for the negotiation of a collective agreement. The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that after negotiating over  clauses of the agreement, the company contested the  January trade union and requested suspension of the negotiations claiming that the latter had ceased to be representative. The complainant alleges that the company then also set out on a campaign to contest the STERSG.
.The Committee points out that, according to the information provided by the Government on  September , the STERSG held an extraordinary general meeting to restructure its executive board and submitted the decision of that meeting to the Trade Unions Directorate in order to obtain the relevant certification. On  October , the Trade Unions Directorate decided not to accept the restructuring of the STERSG s executive board. The Committee observes that it appears from the notice sent by the Trade Unions Directorate to the STERSG, attached by the complainant to the complaint, that the rejection of the restructuring was due to the failure to comply with the legal requirements for holding the meeting of  September. According to the documentation attached to the complaint, it also appears that on  October the employer sent a letter of apology for not being able to participate in the negotiations planned for  October and asking for the negotiating meeting to be rescheduled. According to the Government, on  October, the STERSG held a further extraordinary general meeting to change its executive board and sent the decision to obtain the relevant certification. As confirmed by the Government, on  October the company sent a letter requesting the negotiating proceedings to be archived considering that the STERSG had ceased to be representative, invoking the abovementioned resolution of  October . On  October , the Directorate for Collective Bargaining and Individual Conciliation issued an order in respect of that resolution allowing the company s request and ordered the proceedings to be archived.
.The Committee observes that the company, two days after sending apologies for being unable to attend the negotiating meeting and requesting its rescheduling, requested the archiving of the proceedings, thus ending a bargaining process in which over  clauses on the list of demands had been negotiated. The Committee also observes that the administrative authorities ordered the collective bargaining proceedings to be archived despite the fact that the union had held a further extraordinary meeting to restructure its executive board and had sent the minutes for certification by the authorities, this being the executive board whose validity was not disputed by the Government in its reply. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls the importance of the obligation to encourage and promote collective bargaining, as provided in Article  of Convention No.  and requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure its application in the future. The Committee also recalls the importance which it attaches to the obligation to negotiate in good faith for the maintenance of harmonious development of industrial relations [see Digest, op. cit., para. ] and requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure observance of this principle in the future. The Committee recalls to the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is available in this regard.Request for suspension of the STERSG
.As regards the alleged request for the suspension of the STERSG, the Committee notes that the Government states that in  June , the Roo Sing Garment Co. presented a request for the cancellation of the trade union s legal personality and requested the Trade Unions Directorate to carry out an inspection to verify if it satisfied the legal requirements. The Committee notes that the Directorate carried out the inspection and informed the company, on several occasions, that the application for cancellation should be made to the competent judicial authority, in accordance with article  of the Labour Code. The Committee notes this information and observes that neither the complainant nor the Government have reported the submission of any application by the company to the courts.Conclusion of an agreement with atrade union financed by the employer
.The Committee notes that the complainant alleges that, in February , the company concluded an agreement with the Roo Sing Garment Co. Democratic Workers' Union (a pro-management union according to the complainant) affiliated to the (autonomous) Nicaraguan Workers' Federation (CTN) based in the Ministry of Labour. The Committee notes that the Government confirms the conclusion of the abovementioned agreement which covers all the company s workers, but does not send information on the pro-management character of the trade union in question. The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation into the complainant s allegation and to keep it informed of the result, in particular as regards the representative character or otherwise of the Roo Sing Garment Co. Democratic Workers' Union.Criminal proceedings for slander
.The Committee observes that two company supervisors initiated criminal proceedings for slander and libel against members of the STERSG executive board and workers who testified against them during the special inspection by the Ministry of Labour, within the context of a report of sexual harassment and abuse of position by these company supervisors. According to the complainant, the trade union leaders and workers against whom the slander proceedings were brought are: Csar Prez Rodrguez, Walter Chvez Garca, Walter Prez Canales, Gretchel Surez Martnez, Francisco. Rodrguez Alvarado, Adriana Aguirre Traa, Hazel Briones, Paula Pavn, Tania Carazo Rodrguez, Johana Meja Obando, Socorro del Carmen Bello, Martha Lorena Trujillo, Ana Snchez, Xochilt Gonzles, Janneh Balladares and Cenely Benevidez. The complainant reports that the criminal proceedings are continuing, that the company is paying for the supervisors' lawyer and that the majority of these workers have been dismissed. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Government reports that the inspection confirmed the reported acts of sexual harassment and it was decided to fine the company. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the progress in the criminal proceedings initiated against the members of the trade union s executive board and other workers and hopes that the dismissals resulting from the union testimony in the inspection concerning sexual harassment will be cancelled and the criminal proceedings against the trade unionists for slander and libel declared inadmissible.Blacklists
.Finally, the Committee notes that the complainant alleges that after the trade unionists are dismissed, the employers in the free zones draw up blacklists to prevent them being hired by other companies. The Committee notes that the Government confines itself to stating that no evidence has been found of such blacklists and that under no circumstances do the administrative and judicial authorities allow such practices. The Committee, observes that there is nothing in the Government s statement to indicate that an investigation was conducted into the specific case. The Committee, recalling that all practices involving the  blacklisting' of trade union officials constitutes a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights and governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices [see Digest, op. cit., para. ], requests",1,2003,Nicaragua
46,"the Government to conduct a thorough and independent investigation into the alleged existence of blacklists and to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the dismissal of a number of trade union officials, observing that the dismissals of Mr. Edwin Garca and Ms. Blanca Alejandrina Aruz took place in  and , the Committee deplores the delay in the judicial proceedings and trusts that if the judicial authority confirms the anti-trade union character of those dismissals, both officials will be reinstated without delay and without loss of pay. If the judicial authority determines that reinstatement is not possible, both officials should be fully compensated. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed thereof. The Committee further requests the Government to inform it if Ms. Surez was in fact reinstated in her post.(b) As regards the alleged restrictions on collective bargaining, the Committee requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure in the future the implementation of the obligation to encourage and promote collective bargaining provided in Article  of Convention No.  and observance of the principle of good faith in collective bargaining. The Committee recalls to the Government that the technical assistance of the ILO is available in this regard.(c) As regards the allegation concerning the conclusion of a collective agreement with a trade union financed by the employer, the Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation in this respect and to keep it informed of the result, in particular as regards the representative character or otherwise of the Roo Sing Garment Co. Democratic Workers' Union.(d) As regards the proceedings for slander and libel initiated against trade union officials and members, the Committee requests the Government to send information on the criminal proceedings initiated against the members of the trade union s executive board and other workers and hopes that, since the administrative authority has confirmed that there had indeed been acts of sexual harassment, the dismissals will be cancelled and the criminal proceedings against the trade unionists declared inadmissible.(e) As regards the alleged drawing up of blacklists, the Committee requests the Government to conduct a thorough and independent investigation into the matter and to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2003,Nicaragua
47,".The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  May .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any collective agreements concluded between the Lidia Maradiaga Trade Union and Presitex Corp. S.A. enterprise.(b) With respect to the judicial decision on the dismissal of the four members of the executive committee of the Lidia Maradiaga Trade Union, a copy of which had been requested by the Committee, the Committee requests the complainant organization to provide additional information on these dismissals and requests the Government to send it a copy of the decision as soon as it is handed down.(c) The Committee requests the Government to provide information about the acts of labour insubordination supposedly committed by the members of the Lidia Maradiaga Trade Union, Evelin Moreno and Lilian Moreno, that gave rise to their dismissals, and to indicate whether they have initiated judicial proceedings in this regard. The Committee requests the Government to obtain observations on this issue from the enterprise concerned through the relevant employers' organization.
.The Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC) presented a complaint in a communication dated  April . This organization sent further information in a communication dated  May . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  April and  May , the Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC) alleges that the Presitex Corp. S.A. textile company in the export processing zone, which employs , workers, has committed various violations of trade union rights against the trade union officials of the Lidia Madariaga Trade Union.
.The complainant organization indicates that, following a number of anti-union dismissals, disputes and obstacles to collective bargaining and violations of the collective agreement in previous years, on  January , the company informed the trade union that on  January  there would be new methods for production and for payment of wages and it presented a range of decisions that unilaterally changed the method of payment. On  January , Evelin Moreno and Lilian Moreno were dismissed for their links with the trade union and their opposition to the unilateral changes in the method of payment. On  January , the company prevented the members of the executive committee of the trade union from entering the workplace. On the following day, Miguel Angel Laguna, Secretary-General of the trade union, was attacked by a security employee; the workers protested and stopped work to support this trade union official. On  January, company representatives closed the company and on  January the company made a formal announcement that it was considering withdrawing its investments in Nicaragua and requested a deferral in order to communicate its definitive decision on  February. The complainant organization also refers to pressure that was aggressively and disrespectfully brought to bear by the Embassy of Taiwan and its diplomatic representative on the Ministry of Labour. In the middle of meetings with the authorities and the parties to the dispute, the company requested authorization for the dismissal of the trade union executive committee and the police began to guard the company buildings. Finally, on  March , the labour inspectorate authorized the termination of the employment contracts of four trade union officials, a decision that was confirmed on administrative appeal on  March.
.The complainant organization indicates that in this case it is clear that the workers and their trade unions have been compelled to take part in activities involving partial stoppages and temporary strikes as a last resort to succeed in containing the retaliation offensive of their employer. These situations, perhaps lacking in formal legal status but highly legitimate when faced with a lack of state protection for the rights of workers, have also been examined by the bodies of the ILO in other contexts.
.Finally, the complainant organization states that it has petitioned the legal authorities.
.In its communication of  September , the Government, referring to the dismissal of four members of the Lidia Madariaga Trade Union executive committee, states that the Presitex Corp. S.A. company requested authorization to dismiss from the Ministry of Labour, as laid down in the legislation. The workers submitted in writing a request for a hearing on a collective basis; a decision indicating a hearing for the workers for the second and last time was issued. The workers stated that if they were not allowed to have a hearing on a collective basis they would not appear. A decision was issued to open the procedure to evidence and testimony to both parties for a period of four days, and the time period was extended to enable the authorities to complete this. The Departmental Inspectorate of Labour of Matagalpa admitted all the evidence, submitted by both parties, endeavouring to obtain compromises from the parties so that in the hearing granted to the workers the dispute might be resolved through understanding and agreement. However, this was impossible as the workers requested a collective hearing and the employer requested that the hearing take place on an individual basis with each worker; both parties submitted photographs as evidence but it was not possible to determine what really occurred just by examining these. The workers submitted  signatures in their favour, which were not dated, and none of the three points to which they referred, related to the request in itself or to the authorization for dismissal; the opposite was the case with the  signatures submitted by the employer supporting the company.
.With regard to the witnesses' statements proposed by the workers, the Government states that the workers restricted themselves to giving their version of what occurred without contradicting the main facts, and this was accepted in the complainant s favour. However, the witnesses' statements proposed by the employer, including sworn statements, show that the trade union officials acted disrespectfully towards the employer and work colleagues, reaching the point of abusive words and behaviour, endangering the security of staff and the company and causing economic losses to the company. One of the determining evidentiary elements in this case was a video, which is part of the file and which was seen in the presence of both parties, clearly showing that the trade union officials appearing in said video are those who organized the work stoppage on  January .
.The Government states that the decision issued by the labour inspectorate gave rise to the authorization for dismissal based on the legislation and the internal regulations of the Presitex Corp. S.A. company. The workers appealed the administrative decision of the labour inspector, which allowed workers Miguel Antonio Laguna Laguna, Dulce Lila Osejo Roque, Luisa Ortega Jarquin and Hector Casimiro Centeno Rizo to submit their version of the grievances in reply to those in the abovementioned decision. Subsequently, on  March , the General Inspector for Labour of Managua, of the Ministry of Labour, considered that there was sufficient evidence to show that the persons mentioned were directly responsible for the acts of insubordination that took place in the Presitex Corp. S.A. company, as it was they who incited the other workers to abandon their posts and to continue their defiance by not returning to work, which, as a direct consequence, led to a climate of violence and instability in the workplace as these workers did not fulfil the obligations that their respective employment contracts imposed on them, as can clearly be seen in the file.
.Moreover, the General Inspector for Labour considered that while it is true that the political Constitution of Nicaragua, and the Labour Code, grants workers the right to organize and to carry out any type of demonstration with regard to the fulfilment of their rights, whether they be individual or collective in character, it is nonetheless true that the same law provides, at all times, that the procedures used should be those laid down in the legislation; and that, with their acts of insubordination the persons mentioned above caused economic hardship to the company, which clearly represents non-fulfilment of the obligations that they have as workers. Based on all of the abovementioned, he confirmed entirely the decision appealed against and authorized the termination of the employment contracts of the four trade union officials in question.
.Furthermore, the Government points out that the same complaint from the complainant organization indicates that  in this case it is clear the workers and their trade unions have been compelled to take part in activities involving partial stoppages and temporary strikes as a last resort to succeed in containing the retaliation offensive of their employer. These situations perhaps lack formal legal status but are highly legitimate when faced with a",0,2003,Nicaragua
48,"lack of state protection'  The Government states that protection of freedom of association by the State is particularly exercised against any act that aims to dismiss a worker or to cause prejudice for a worker in any form because of his/her trade union affiliation, but that, in the present case, the confession by the complainants of  activities involving partial stoppages and temporary strikes is clear'  These situations do in fact lack formal legal status; and they can never become in any way legal or officially permitted. The complainant recognizes that the practice used by the trade union executive board was completely inappropriate and illegal when it encouraged the other workers to abandon their work and posts, misrepresenting the trade union right to demonstrate in accordance with the law.
.The Government concludes by stating that on  June , a collective agreement was signed between the Presitex Corp. S.A. company and the Democratic Workers' Trade Union of the Presitex Corp. S.A. company, for two years from the date of signature.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in the present case refer mainly to the dismissal of four members of the executive committee of the Lidia Madariaga Trade Union as a result of a collective dispute relating to the unilateral changes by the Presitex Corp. S.A. company in the methods of production and payment of wages. The Committee notes that the Government justifies the administrative authorization for the dismissal of the four trade union officials by stating that they incited the other workers to abandon their posts and to continue their acts of insubordination by not returning to work, with the direct consequence of a climate of violence and instability as these workers did not fulfil the obligations imposed upon them by their respective employment contracts; the Government also states that these acts of insubordination led to economic hardship for the company, and that the complainant organization recognizes in its complaint that partial stoppages and temporary strikes lacked formal legal status; according to the Government s reply the trade union officials acted disrespectfully towards the employer and work colleagues, reaching the point of abusive words and behaviour.
.The Committee notes, however, that, although this is a collective dispute, the Government recognizes that in the procedure carried out by the labour inspectorate, the workers requested a collective hearing and the employer requested that the hearing be on an individual basis with each worker and that because of this it was impossible for the dispute to be resolved through understanding and agreement. Moreover, the complainant organization highlighted pressure from the Embassy of Taiwan and its diplomatic representative on the Ministry of Labour, and the threat of the company to withdraw its investments in Nicaragua. Furthermore, the Government has not indicated whether, as maintained by the complainant organization as the cause of the dispute, the employer unilaterally imposed new methods of production and payment of the workers; neither has it provided its observations on the previous dismissal of two workers belonging to the trade union (Evelin Moreno and Lilian Moreno) as a result of their opposition to the unilateral changes in the method of payment, nor on the attack that the Secretary-General of the trade union suffered at the hands of a security employee of the company.
.The Committee requests the Government to send information on: (i) the alleged unilateral decision of the Presitex enterprise to modify the methods of production and the system of wage payments without consulting the union; (ii) the reasons why the enterprise and the Ministry refused to accept the collective audience requested by the workers aimed at obtaining the conclusion of a collective agreement; (iii) the alleged pressure exercised by diplomatic representatives of a foreign country on the Ministry of Labour. The Committee requests the Government to promote an appropriate procedure for collective bargaining at the enterprise and to ensure that no outside pressure is brought to bear on the collective bargaining process in violation of Convention No. .
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to provide it with a copy of the decision handed down by the judicial authorities on the dismissal of the four members of the trade union executive committee, as well as information on the specific facts that were cause for the dismissal of the trade union members Evelin Moreno and Lilian Moreno. The Committee also requests the Government to ensure that those concerned are reinstated in their jobs without loss of pay if it is shown that their dismissals were due to anti-union motives.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to send information on: (i) the alleged unilateral decision of the Presitex enterprise to modify the methods of production and the system of wage payments without consulting the union; (ii) the reasons why the enterprise and the Ministry refused to accept the collective audience requested by the workers aimed at obtaining the conclusion of a collective agreement;and (iii) the alleged pressure exercised by diplomatic representatives of a foreign country on the Ministry of Labour.

49,".The complaint is set out in a communication from the National Union of Employees (UNE) General Confederation dated  May . This organization sent further information in the communication of  June . The Public Services International (PSI) supported the complaint made by the UNE in the communications dated  June and  July . The Government sent its observations in communications of  September  and  January .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the National Union of Employees (UNE) General Confederation alleges that following a decision made public by the former President of the Republic on  February , the Government suspended the check-off of the trade union contributions of UNE members as provided for in current collective agreements and section  of the Labour Code, according to which  employers must deduct the ordinary and extraordinary contributions established by the trade union according to its statutes from the salaries of workers who are affiliated to the trade union and give their voluntary authorization'  On the basis of this, the UNE filed a petition before the Appeals Court of the Circumscription of Managua on  March . In the text of the petition and that of the Court s decision to grant the admissibility of the petition, it is specified that the question relates to statements made by the President and  the threat to prohibit and eliminate the deductions made by trade unions from their members as trade union contributions from the state payroll through a presidential agreement'  This situation is financially  asphyxiating' trade unions.
.In its communication of  June , the UNE makes allegations concerning the dismissal in April  of Mr. Edgard Marenco Torres and Mr. Eduardo Jos Lacayo Castillo, officials from the Trade Union of Workers of the Supreme Electoral Council (SITRACSE). Neither official has been reinstated in his job by the Supreme Electoral Council authorities despite administrative resolutions requesting their reinstatement which date back to May .
.In its communications of  September  and  January , the Government states that the complainant organization indeed filed a petition of amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) relating to the deduction of trade union contributions from workers, and that the only action to be taken is to wait for the verdict of the judicial authority.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Edgard Marenco Torres and Mr. Eduardo Jos Lacayo Castillo, the Government states that two petitions have been made relating to this case, the first being through administrative action before the Ministry of Labour, and the second through legal action before the labour courts. The two people concerned submitted a document to the Departmental Labour Inspectorate for the Services Sector of Managua denouncing their dismissal by the employer, the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE), through the CSE General Division of Human Resources and Training ' with allegations, inter alia, that the procedures established in section  of the Labour Code had been violated. Subsequently, the abovementioned Inspectorate confirmed that the cancellation of the employment contracts of Mr. Marenco Torres and Mr. Lacayo Castillo violated the procedures established in sections  and  of the Labour Code. The Directorate of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour issued a statement that both persons in question enjoyed the trade union immunity established in the Labour Code. The Inspectorate subsequently decided to cancel the dismissals and issued a warning that one working day after receiving notification, the employer had to reinstate the workers in question in their previous jobs and with the original salaries. Furthermore, the employer ' the CSE ' had to respect the resolution of the Departmental Labour Inspectorate in time and form; this was not the case. Since the resolution was not appealed, it remained in force. Following these events, the persons in question presented their case through legal action before the First Labour Court, requesting their effective reinstatement and the payment of lost earnings, thereby opening the respective judicial proceedings. The Labour Court judge issued a resolution ordering their reinstatement and requesting a writ of execution of the sentence given in their favour. It is now up to the parties to institute all necessary proceedings to have the sentence applied.
.As regards the allegation concerning the suspension of the check-off of the trade union contributions of UNE members in violation of national legislation, the Committee notes that the Government states that this issue has been referred to the judicial authority, and that the only action to be taken is to wait for the judicial verdict. The Committee recalls that the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee observes that at its November  meeting it examined another complaint against the Government of Nicaragua for the suspension of the check-off facility [see th Report, Case No. , paras.  and ]. The Committee concludes with concern that this problem affects several trade union organizations and expresses the hope that the judicial authority will take the aforementioned principle fully into account when formulating its ruling. The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the ruling handed down in this regard.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union officials, Mr. Edgard Marenco Torres and Mr. Eduardo Jos Lacayo Castillo from the Supreme Electoral Council, the Committee notes with interest that, according to the Government, both the administrative authority and the judicial authority confirmed that their dismissal violated national legislation and ordered their reinstatement in their jobs. The Committee urges the Government to ensure that both officials are effectively reinstated without loss of pay in their jobs without delay and to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegation concerning the suspension of the check-off of the trade union contributions of UNE members in violation of national legislation, the Committee expresses the hope that the judicial authority will take the principle according to which  the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided' fully into account when formulating its ruling. The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the ruling handed down in this regard.(b) As regards the dismissal of the trade union officials Mr. Edgard Marenco Torres and Mr. Eduardo Jos Lacayo Castillo from the Supreme Electoral Council, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that both officials are effectively reinstated without loss of pay in their jobs without delay and to keep it informed in this regard.",0,2002,Nicaragua
50,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  meeting, and on that occasion expressed regret that the negotiation of a list of demands presented by the Jos Benito Escobar Workers' Trade Union Confederation (CST-JBE) in the construction sector had gone on for more than a year. The Committee notes with interest that the parties involved and officials from the Ministry of Labour signed agreements in August and September  which ended the dispute. The Committee requested the Government to take steps to ensure that, in future, collective bargaining procedures are carried out within reasonable time limits [see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in its th Session (November )].
.In a communication dated  November , the CST-JBE alleges serious delays in the negotiation of a collective agreement, in contravention of the time limits established by legislation. It adds that the Nicaraguan Construction Chamber (CNC) failed to attend the hearings set by the conciliator, which delayed negotiations, and that the Ministry of Labour has not responded to the complainant's request to appoint the president of the strike council.
.In its communication of  November , the Government states that the collective agreement of  provided for its own revision from  February . The Government adds that, according to the employers, a considerable number of construction companies had closed down during the negotiations, while in others, workers were at their lowest productive capacity. The workers' committee complained of the repeated absences of the CNC from meetings. A request was made to the collective negotiations directorate to take steps in accordance with the law (section  of the Labour Code) to establish a strike council. The Government adds that, at the request of the members of the trade unions and confederations in this sector, the strike council was appointed within the statutory period once the negotiation process had been exhausted. The Government states that although this process took longer than the period stipulated by law, extensions were given at the request of the parties for the purpose of consulting their respective leaders and economic sectors on the proposals that had been made. The Government concludes by stating that on  August , definitive agreements were reached between the parties.
.The Committee takes note of this information and expects that, in future, the process of negotiating the collective agreement will take place within the time limits provided for in legislation.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  from the Jos Benito Escobar Workers' Trade Union Confederation (CST-JBE). Subsequently, the CST-JBE sent further information in a communication dated  June . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July and  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In communications dated  May and  June , the Jos Benito Escobar Workers' Trade Union Confederation (CST-JBE) states that, in accordance with the provisions of article  of the Labour Code:  The collective agreement shall be revised before its validity expires at the request of one of the parties, if there are substantial changes to the social and economic conditions of the company or the country that make this advisable'  On  May  the National Trade Union of Carpenters, Bricklayers and Allied Trade Unions (SNSCAASC) presented a list of demands to the Ministry of Labour to activate the revision procedure for the collective agreement that had been signed in April  with the Nicaraguan Construction Industry Association (CNC).
.The complainant organization states that the periods laid down in article  of the Labour Code were not respected ( days extended by another period of eight days) in the negotiating process. According to the CST-JBE, the negotiating period was extended to more than one year and the CNC was not present at  of the  meetings that were held.
.The complainant organization also states that on more than six occasions it requested the Directorate of Conciliation and Counsel for Mediation to appoint a Strike Council to resolve the conflict but the administrative authority has not ruled with regard to this. Finally, the complainant organization states that the Directorate of Individual and Collective Conciliation of the Ministry of Labour determined unilaterally to extend the collective agreement for a period equal to the previous one, violating the negotiation process.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government stated that the Departmental Inspectorate of Labour, Construction, Transport and Telecommunications Sector of Managua received a list of demands submitted by the SNSCAASC and transferred proceedings to the Directorate of Individual and Collective Conciliation in a decree dated  April .
.The Government also states that both parties set the criteria for agreement on the spirit of the negotiation and established written records to the fact that they would revise totally the list of rates beginning with the carpenters and establishing a temporary wage while the negotiations took place. With regard to this, the Government states that it could be said that there is no conflict as none of the grounds established in article  of the Labour Code are present.
.The Government states that owing to the fact that the wages of workers in the construction industry, in accordance with the legal provisions of article b of the Labour Code, are stipulated by unit of work, piece or item, the clause in question is considered fundamental as what the negotiation procedure hoped to correct was the wage discrepancies in this sector. However, the Government indicates that the collective agreement of the construction industry was still valid, therefore the procedure was not the correct one inasmuch as the wage demands were a revision and not a submission of a list of demands.
.The Government states that while article  accepts the possibility of revision, the legislation does not state clearly whether the procedure to follow is that stipulated in articles  to  inclusive of the Labour Code on conciliation. In any case, the Government indicates that the Directorate of Conciliation reminded the parties that while differences could arise during the proceedings, these should occur in an atmosphere of agreement and harmony, and it repeated to the parties that the revision taking place was exclusively on the wage clause and was not a negotiation of a list of demands with regard to the collective agreement, the latter having been extended automatically in accordance with article  of the Labour Code (this article states that:  The term of the collective agreement being expired, without there being any request for revision, the agreement shall be extended for a period equal to that of its previous validity' , to expire on  April . The Government states that the process is continuing and at a recent meeting held at the Ministry of Labour in July , the parties, in mutual agreement, decided to continue the negotiations for a wage revision for a further three months from the signing of the agreement, both undertaking in a climate of harmony to reach consensus on the proposals and that these agreements would be communicated to the ILO at the end of the period.
.In its communication of  October , the Government declares that agreements signed on  August and  September  between, on the one hand, the Nicaraguan Construction Chamber (CNC), the National Trade Union of Carpenters, Bricklayers and Allied Trade Unions (SNSCAASC-CST), the Nicaraguan Federation of Construction and Wood Workers (FITCMN), and, on the other hand, civil servants from the Ministry of Labour, put an end to the labour conflict in the construction sector.
.The Committee notes that in this case the complainant organization states that: () in May , the National Trade Union of Carpenters, Bricklayers and Allied Trade Unions (SNSCAASC) submitted a list of demands to the administrative authority to begin revision proceedings of the collective agreement concluded in April  with the Nicaraguan Construction Industry Association (CNC); () this proceeding took place over more than one year, violating the time period laid down in the Labour Code for negotiations; () the CNC was not present at a number of meetings relating to the negotiation hearings; () on various occasions the administrative authority was requested to convoke a Strike Council but there has been no ruling in this respect; and () finally, the Directorate of Individual and Collective Conciliation of the Ministry of Labour decided unilaterally to extend the collective agreement for a period equivalent to that for which it had previously been valid.
.The Committee notes the Government s statement that: (i) this case does not represent a collective conflict (change in the collective agreement as a whole) but tries to clarify wage discrepancies in the sector; (ii) there is a collective agreement in force, which means that the procedure that should have been followed is that of revision of the agreement and not submission of a list of demands; (iii) the collective agreement was extended according to article  of the Labour",1,2002,Nicaragua
51,"Code which states that:  The term of the collective agreement being expired, without there being any request for revision, the agreement shall be extended for a period equal to that of its previous validity'  (iv) the parties, in mutual agreement, decided in July  to continue the negotiations for a wage revision for a further three months from the signing of the agreement, both parties undertaking to reach a consensus on the proposals in a climate of harmony; and (v) in August and September , the parties and the Ministry of Labour signed agreements which put an end to the labour dispute.
.First, the Committee regrets that, although the procedure begun was not the correct one, the negotiation of a list of demands has lasted more than one year. In this sense, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that, in the future, collective bargaining procedures are carried out within reasonable time limits.
.Second, the Committee notes with interest that the parties and civil servants from the Ministry of Labour have signed agreements in August and September  which put an end to the labour dispute.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:Regretting that the negotiation of a list of demands has lasted more than one year, the Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that, in the future, collective bargaining procedures are carried out within reasonable time limits.",1,2002,Nicaragua
52,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC) dated  November ; subsequently the association submitted further information on  March . The Government replied in a communication dated  November . On two occasions, the Office requested, without success, clarifications from the complainant organization on statements made by the Government.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  November , the Latin American Federation of Education and Culture Workers (FLATEC) states that in Nicaragua, in accordance with national legislation, the State deducts the trade union dues of education workers belonging to the trade union association in question, and pays the trade union dues by cheque directly to the Education and Culture Workers' Federation of Nicaragua (FENITEC), affiliated to FLATEC. The complainant organization states that this customary practice for the whole of the labour collective and the other trade union associations of the country underwent a serious change after the President of the Republic, in a public speech, said that, finding himself in disagreement with the executive committees of the trade union associations for education, the check-off facility for trade union dues would be withdrawn for the trade unions of the country, and among them FENITEC, as they had indicated their willingness to begin strike action in March . This interference by the State in the trade union freedoms of local workers of the organization was carried out and, to date, as a result of this reprisal against the trade unions, FENITEC is undergoing serious economic problems in continuing to develop its trade union programme and activities in defence of the interests of its members.
.In its communication dated  March , FLATEC stated that, following the submission of the complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Government convoked FENITEC to find a solution to the problem, thus providing a possibility of resolving the conflict in the framework of a renewal of collective bargaining in the education sector.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government states that the provisions of the Labour Code are compulsory for all natural or legal persons established in the country. With regard to the deduction of the trade union dues of workers, this must take place expressly, that is to say the workers must accept, by signing a document, that trade union dues are deducted from their wages. The document must be submitted by members of the executive committee of the trade union organization so that the deduction of trade union dues from the wages of the staff is carried out. The Government states that if the executive committees of trade union organizations follow the relevant procedures and the employer refuses to carry out the deductions, the trade unions can submit a complaint to the departmental delegations of the Ministry of Labour, which will take the necessary steps to ensure that the labour legislation is complied with.
.The Government states that the complaint lacks the following clarifications: the number of workers allegedly affected; any indication that the trade union organization complied with the relevant procedures in accordance with the law; and information on the departmental delegations of the Ministry of Labour where the respective complaints were presented.
.The Committee notes that, in this case, the complainant organization alleges that the trade union dues of the trade union federation FENITEC were not deducted as a result of the statement of their willingness to begin strike action in March . The Committee also notes that the complainant organization stated in March  that the Government had convoked FENITEC to find a solution to the problem in order to resolve the conflict. The Government, meanwhile, while recognizing that the deduction of trade union dues from wages is provided for and regulated in the legislation, with the possibility of recourse to the administrative authorities if the legislation is not complied with, emphasizes that the complaint lacks clarification (number of workers affected, compliance with the legal procedures and presentation of complaints to the administrative authorities). The Committee notes that the Office has requested on two occasions, without success, that the complainant organization clarify these details.
.The Committee recalls that  the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided' [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee is of the opinion that non-deduction of trade union dues should not in any circumstances, be a measure caused by the carrying out of legitimate trade union activities. In this case, taking into account that national legislation allows for the deduction of trade union dues from wages, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation and, if it finds that FENITEC has complied with the legal requirements, to ensure the immediate restoration of the deduction of the trade union dues of its members from their wages. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to carry out an investigation into the allegations and, if it finds that FENITEC has complied with the legal requirements, to ensure the immediate restoration of the deduction of the trade union dues of its members from their wages.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",0,2001,Nicaragua
53,".The Committee last examined this case, relating to anti-union dismissals and transfers and withdrawal of the check-off facility in the health sector, at its June  meeting [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee requested the Government to ensure that the transferred officers are not impeded in the exercise of their trade union activities, and to re-establish the payroll check-off facility.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government refers to the communication of the Ministry of Labour dated  April , already examined by the Committee at its June  meeting, in which it points out that the deduction of union dues is carried out once the express consent of each worker has been obtained and that a list of such deductions must be submitted to the employer; should the employer refuse to authorize them, the trade union has the right to ask the departmental offices of the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary measures to guarantee compliance with labour legislation.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided any new information and urges the Government immediately to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee the exercise of trade union activities by the transferred officers and to proceed to re-establish the payroll check-off facility.
.The complaint is contained in two communications dated  January and  March  from the Health Workers' Federation (FETSALUD). The Government replied in communications dated  March and  April .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Workers' Representatives Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  January , the Health Workers' Federation (FETSALUD) claims that the Government is conducting a campaign of repression and discrimination against the country s trade union movement, and against the leadership of FETSALUD in particular.
.The Federation alleges that, on the spurious ground that they had refused to be transferred to the emergency zones established in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, a number of trade union officers (Oscar Lon Godoy, Elio Artola Navarrete, Roberto Lpez Vargas, Harry Torrez Sols, Jos Dionisio Morales Castillo, Carlos Torrez Lacourt and Guillermo Porras Cortez), were deprived of their trade union immunity and dismissed (with Ministry of Labour approval) pursuant to two decisions, respectively dated  and  December , by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Inspectorate.
.The officers in question having instituted amparo proceedings against both decisions on grounds of violation of trade union rights, on  September  the Supreme Court of Justice handed down a final ruling (No. ) that the Government, via the Labour and Health Ministries, had committed serious violations of freedom of association and trade union rights. The Court consequently ordered that the complainants be reinstated under the same conditions of employment and with the same responsibilities as those held at the time of their dismissal, and that they be paid their wages in arrears and the corresponding benefits. It also underscored that there were to be no retaliatory measures.
.The Government rejected the above ruling on various grounds, all of which were declared inadmissible by the Supreme Court. In a decision dated  December , the Office of the Procurator-General for Human Rights stated that the Minister of Health had infringed the officers' human rights in systematically refusing to comply with the ruling. In view of the foregoing, on  December the Health Minister officially announced the Ministry s recognition of the court order of reinstatement.
.Four days later, however, the Health Ministry s Director of Human Resources informed the officers that they had been appointed to run hospitals in remote parts of the country, such as Karawala, Wiwilli, Nueva Guinea, Waslala and Siuna. The complainants regarded this as a measure of internal exile and geographical confinement of trade union officers, taken in retaliation for the judicial proceedings they had brought before the country s highest judicial body.
.In a communication dated  March , the complainant organization reports that on  February  President Arnaldo Alemn issued an order via the written press withdrawing payroll check-off for public sector employees, thereby affecting deductions in favour of the unions, in violation of article  of the Labour Code.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government declares that the Managua branch of the Departmental Labour Inspectorate approved the requests submitted by the directors of certain hospitals to terminate the contracts of employment of Dr. Gustavo Porras Cortez and other physicians. The Government adds that the individuals concerned appealed against the Inspectorate s decision within the prescribed deadlines and in compliance with the mandatory procedures.
.Having specified that administrative action under the Labour Code is not subject to the strict provisions of ordinary law, the Government explains that the physicians in question were dismissed for refusing to comply with an order of transfer to areas devastated by Hurricane Mitch ' on which ground the Labour Inspectorate challenged the appeal brought by the dismissed physicians, pursuant to articles (d) (reasons for termination of the employment relationship) and  (relative to trade union immunity, which stipulates that workers enjoying such immunity may not be dismissed without the Labour Ministry s prior authorization, based on a legitimate reason provided for in law and duly substantiated) of the Labour Code, among other legal sources.
.The physicians concerned nevertheless initiated amparo proceedings before the Supreme Court of Justice, whose Constitutional Chamber declared their appeal receivable. The High Directorate of the Ministry of Justice thus invalidated the administrative decisions of the Managua branch of the Departmental Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Inspectorate, which subsequently ordered that the physicians be reinstated in their posts under identical conditions of employment and that they be paid their wages in arrears along with the benefits to which they were entitled, in accordance with the ruling handed down by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court.
.The Ministry of Health for its part raised the question of a conflict of jurisdiction, claiming that competence to hear such cases lay with the labour courts. The Labour Court of Second Instance requested the General Labour Inspectorate to refrain from further action and decided to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for decision on which of the two bodies had jurisdiction ' the General Labour Inspectorate or the Labour Court of Second Instance.
.The Government adds that Dr. Gustavo Porras Cortez is not exercising his duties as Secretary-General of FETSALUD, because the Federation ceased to operate after  November  for failing to comply with the requirement to renew its executive committee within the time frame prescribed by the Regulations of Trade Union Associations.
.In a communication of  April , the Government indicates that the legislation provides for payroll check-off only if the union s member gives his or her express authorization to it.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case concern anti-union dismissals and transfers, and denial of payroll check-off. As regards the first allegation, it takes note that a number of trade union officers (Oscar Lon Godoy, Elio Artola Navarrete, Roberto Lpez Vargas, Harry Torrez Sols, Jos Dionisio Morales Castillo, Carlos Torrez Lacourt and Guillermo Porras Cortez) were deprived of their trade union immunity and dismissed in December , pursuant to decisions by the Departmental Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Inspectorate, for failing to comply with the order of transfer to areas devastated by Hurricane Mitch.
.The Committee further notes that the Supreme Court of Justice, after hearing the appeal lodged by the officers against the aforementioned decisions, handed down a final ruling (No. ) on  September , ordering that the complainants be reinstated without retaliation of any kind, under identical conditions of employment and with the same responsibilities as those held at the time of their dismissal, and that they be paid their wages in arrears and the corresponding benefits.
.The Committee nevertheless observes that, according to the complainant organization, on  December  ' i.e. after the Ministry of Health had officially announced the dismissed physicians' reinstatement by court order ' the Health Ministry s Director of Human Resources ordered the transfer of the officers to remote regions of the country. Consequently, the Committee recalls that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that union officials should enjoy adequate protection against acts of discrimination in respect of their employment, such as dismissal, [  transfer or other prejudicial measures, because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.The Committee considers that the transferred trade union officers should be able to continue performing their duties as before, as long as those who elected them mandate them to do so. The Committee accordingly requests the Government to ensure that the transferred officers are not impeded in the exercise",1,2001,Nicaragua
54,"of their trade union activities, and to keep it informed in this regard.
.The Committee further notes that the officers were deprived of their trade union immunity in December  already and that, according to the Government, Dr. Gustavo Porras Cortez is not exercising his duties as Secretary-General of FETSALUD because the latter ceased operating after  November  for failing to comply with the requirement to renew its executive committee within the time frame prescribed by the Regulations of Trade Union Associations. The Committee takes due note of the Government s statement but considers that such suspension of operation might simply be a logical consequence of the officers' dismissal.
.The Committee finally takes note of the allegation that in February  the Government ordered the suspension of payroll check-off for employees, in violation of article  of the Labour Code. In this connection, the Committee emphasizes that it is necessary to avoid withdrawal of the check-off facility, as this might lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations and is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee accordingly requests the Government to re-establish the check-off facility and to keep it informed in this respect.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Considering that the transferred trade union officers should be able to continue performing their duties as before, as long as those who elected them mandate them to do so, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the transferred officers are not impeded in the exercise of their trade union activities, and to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee recalls that it is necessary to avoid withdrawal of the check-off facility, as this might lead to financial difficulties for trade union organizations and is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial relations. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to re-establish the payroll check-off facility and to keep it informed in this respect.",1,2001,Nicaragua
55,".The Committee last examined this case, concerning the dismissal of a trade union official, at its meeting in March  [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee drew up the following recommendations:(a) In order to be able to give an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to supply the substance of the ruling handed down by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissals which were the subject of legal challenges, and of the ruling given by the criminal court dealing with the criminal proceedings initiated by the company against the ten trade union officials.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights can be freely exercised at CHENTEX Garments S.A. without the workers being subject to reprisals for their legitimate trade union activities.(c) The Committee is bound to emphasize the importance of the principle that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement. In accordance with this principle, the Committee reminds the Government that appropriate measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements.
.In its communication of  April , the Government sent the Committee a copy of the ruling handed down by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissals which were the subject of legal challenges. This ruling ordered the reinstatement of nine trade unionists into their previous positions, under the same terms and conditions that had previously applied. As soon as the Government has been informed of the ruling handed down by the criminal court, it will send a copy to the Committee. The Government stated that the Ministry of Labour maintains a labour inspectorate in the export processing zone to ensure that workers are not subject to reprisals for carrying out their legitimate trade union activities, including employees at CHENTEX Garments S.A. Furthermore, the Government sent a copy of the collective agreement signed by the enterprise and the Trade Union of Independent Workers, which, in accordance with the country s labour laws, covers all workers of the enterprise. With its communication of  May , the Government attaches a copy of the agreement concluded by the company and the complainant organization whereby: all the labour and criminal proceedings currently pending are withdrawn; four trade union leaders are reinstated into their jobs; and the phased-in reinstatement of  other workers is planned. The parties to the agreement further agree to resort to negotiation and dialogue to settle disputes.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.In their communications of  July,  August and  September , the ""Jos Benito Escobar"" Trade Union Confederation of Workers (CST) and the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation (ITGLWF) stated that in , the workers of the ""Las Mercedes"" export processing zones corporation began initiatives to form enterprise-level trade unions. According to them, on  January ,  employees of CHENTEX Garments S.A. held a general meeting with a view to establishing a trade union affiliated to the CST and appointing its executive committee. On  January,  workers at the enterprise were dismissed, including all members of the recently elected executive committee. On  January all the company's workers ( at the time) came out on strike to protest the dismissal of their colleagues, who were reinstated by the company on the same day. On  February, the trade union obtained legal personality and was entered on the appropriate register (although not within the period of ten days stipulated in section  of the Labour Code in force). Nevertheless, the same month, the company renewed its anti-union campaign and again dismissed the executive committee members as well as other company employees. On  February, these actions led to another strike which was immediately resolved in the same way as before.
.According to the complainant organization, two trade unions operated in the enterprise: the CHENTEX company trade union affiliated to the CST; and an autonomous union affiliated to the Nicaraguan Central Workers' Confederation (CNT), favoured by the enterprise. Indeed, one CST-affiliated union official stated that the company management had offered him money to change unions (to the CNT-affiliated union) and had dismissed him when he refused. Gradually, hundreds of workers who supported the CST-affiliated union were forced to leave it on threats of dismissal. Recent recruits were asked to join the CNT-affiliated union, and one CST-affiliated union official was forced to resign after being blackmailed. In addition, workers employed in the export processing zone suffered attacks, including physical assaults, and the Ministry of Labour interfered in the union's activities through spies and strike-breakers. The CNT-affiliated union distributed pamphlets calling into question the integrity of the other union's officials, and despite the latter's complaints the authorities did nothing. Finally, according to a former CHENTEX employee, the Deputy Minister of Labour told the press (in May ) that Taiwanese investors had threatened to close down their operations in the export processing zone if the Ministry of Labour came down in favour of the CST-affiliated union.
.In this context, the company concluded a collective agreement with both unions (in August ), by which it committed itself in an ""instrument of accord"" to review wages within a period of less than one year and to review transport and food subsidies in the light of available resources. Despite this, the head of the company on  June  again refused to enter into talks with the CST-affiliated union, although it had undertaken to do so. On  August, the union therefore presented a list of demands (signed by  workers) to the Ministry of Labour which passed it on to the company and called the parties together on a number of occasions between  January and  March . Although CHENTEX did not come to the talks, it did sign an agreement in the meantime with the autonomous CNT-affiliated union under which it agreed to review the wages of all the workers; the Conciliation Department of the Ministry of Labour rejected an application from the CST-affiliated union to declare the company in default, and indeed declared that the company had complied with the agreement, since it had offered a  per cent increase to  per cent of the workforce with effect from  March . Under these circumstances, the CST-affiliated union on  April challenged the company's account of the wage increase on the grounds that it had been agreed exclusively with the CNT-affiliated union and discriminated against members of the CST-affiliated union. It then initiated the appropriate proceedings with the Ministry of Labour (under section  of the Labour Code) to begin strike action, but it was forced to begin again when its application was disregarded (still without success).
.On  April the CST-affiliated union called a strike in protest at the refusal by CHENTEX to bargain in good faith. Although all the workers were at their posts when labour inspectors entered the plant to assess the situation, the Ministry of Labour informed the union's leaders on  May that the company was seeking the termination of their contracts of employment on the grounds of failure to perform their duties. Following a protest strike on the same day (in which  workers took part, not , as claimed by the Government), the company on  May hired a group of youths from a problem neighbourhood to cause disruption. Finally, on  May the Ministry of Labour authorized the dismissal of nine trade union officials who challenged the ruling in an appeal and amparo proceedings; a final ruling is still awaited. In this context, the company on  June  asked the labour tribunal to dissolve the CST-affiliated union on the grounds that it had fewer members than the number required by law (following successive reviews, only one official and two ordinary members remained at the enterprise). On  June the company initiated criminal proceedings against ten union officials for offences punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment without any possibility of commutation. On  June the members of the CHENTEX union declared that they would not hold elections until these cases were resolved.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that on  July , the administration of CHENTEX Garments S.A. petitioned the General Labour Inspectorate to apply the appropriate legal procedures to declare illegal the strike that had been called that day by company workers. It stated that some  per cent of the workers supported the strike for reasons of solidarity with workers dismissed from another textile company located in the same zone, because of the alleged failure to comply with the collective agreement and in order to force the company to allow negotiations in the enterprise with the participation of a trade union representative.
.Also on  July, following an",1,2000,Nicaragua
56,"on-site inspection, the enterprise was found to be paralysed and accordingly, on  July, the Labour Inspectorate ruled that the strike called by the union's executive committee was illegal since the latter had not complied with sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. According to these provisions, for a strike to be called, the relevant conciliation procedure with the Ministry of Labour must have been exhausted, the strike must be agreed at a general meeting of the workers and conducted in a peaceful manner by the majority of workers inside or outside the enterprise or establishment. Under the terms of the Code, striking workers were told that they would have to resume work within  hours of the ruling, and that the employer would terminate the employment contracts of any workers who continued to strike illegally.
.On  August, the company again petitioned the Labour Inspectorate to declare illegal the strike of  workers of the  who worked in the garment pressing area, since they, too, had failed to follow the procedure set out in section  of the Labour Code. Workers were on strike in protest at the termination of the employment contracts of Juan Baltodano and Juan Merenco. Following an on-site inspection, labour inspectors informed the workers that the employer could rescind a contract of employment under the terms of section  of the Labour Code (for an indeterminate period and without giving any reason), and that they could not withdraw their labour without first exhausting the procedure established under section  of the Labour Code. For this reason, the stoppage was not valid; the workers were told that any employee whose contract of employment was revoked could appeal to a competent judge for a ruling as to whether or not there were grounds for reinstatement, and it was not in the power of the Ministry of Labour to order a worker's reinstatement. On  August , the General Labour Inspectorate ruled that the strike directed by the executive committee of the CHENTEX union was illegal, and the striking workers were informed that they would have to resume work within  hours or their contracts of employment would be terminated by the employer in accordance with sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code.
.On  April , the CST-affiliated union and the other trade union involved discussed the wage claims with the company administration but no agreement was reached. On  April, the members of the union's executive committee left their workplaces for one hour and were told by the company that they had to exhaust the available statutory procedures. On  April, the company administration applied for the cancellation of the employment contracts of Gladis Manzanares, Santiago Villalobos, Flix Rosales Garca, Harlling Bobadilla Treminio, Blanca Torrez Seas, Roberto Manzanares, Maura Parson, Zeneyda Torres and Flix Sanches. They were summoned to a hearing but did not appear, and instead called on the other workers to stop work in protest at the notice. On  May the strikers resorted to damaging property, intimidation and violence. On  May they appeared before the local labour inspectorate (agricultural and industrial department). They did not deny the claims made by the company administration, which supported its demands for dismissal with written evidence and witness statements. On  May they were reinstated in their posts, but the Labour Inspectorate authorized the cancellation of the contracts of employment of the nine workers. Notification was received on  May and the workers appealed. The Labour Inspectorate passed the case on to the Minister of Labour to allow him to appoint an ad hoc General Labour Inspector. The latter dismissed the appeal and upheld the original ruling for dismissal on the grounds that the employer had shown that there were grounds for dismissal. On  July the ad hoc General Labour Inspector was informed of the ruling handed down by the Constitutional Division (Region III Managua) of the Supreme Court regarding the amparo proceedings initiated by Gladis Manzanares Tercero, Santiago Villalobos and others in their capacity as workers of CHENTEX Garments S.A. On  August the Labour Inspectorate sent the Court the report which the latter had requested and the matter is currently still pending before the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court.
.On  June the administration of CHENTEX asked the Labour Inspectorate to verify the current situation of the CST-affiliated union, given that a number of workers of the enterprise had allegedly resigned from it. It was found that of the  workers who had taken part in the most recent extraordinary general meeting,  had resigned from the company,  had been dismissed, three had put two signatures, two had written their names illegibly,  had left the union and two remained members. This clearly explains why the union is currently registered with the trade union associations directorate as ""inactive"", since in addition,  of the union officials who had formed the executive committee, only one female official remains active, the other  having been dismissed for contravening the terms of their contracts of employment and causing damage to the company (the company initiated legal proceedings against them on  June  for breaches of trade freedom, freedom to work and freedom of association, extortion, rioting, incitement to violence and conspiracy).
.With regard to the allegation of wrongful dismissals for anti-union reasons, the Committee notes that, according to the complainants, a number of employees of the textile company CHENTEX Garments S.A. on  January  joined forces to establish a company trade union affiliated to the ""Jos Benito Escobar"" Trade Union Confederation of Workers (CST) but that this initiative was restricted by a series of anti-union acts which began on  January with the dismissal without any apparent reason of  employees (including all the officers of the new union), which was followed by another dismissal of executive committee members, and ended in June , when the company sought the dissolution of the union after the competent authority had found that only one officer and a few members remained in it. The Committee notes that, according to the complainants, the inadmissibility of the dismissals in question lies in the fact that they were associated with the establishment of the CST-affiliated union, were supposedly motivated by the strikes that had taken place, and reflected the wish of the company to liquidate the union, whose officers (except one) and many of whose members had been dismissed.
.The Committee notes the arguments put forward by the complainant organization to demonstrate the anti-union nature of the dismissals, and is bound to note that during the past two years, many measures were adopted against the officials and members of the CST-affiliated union, including criminal proceedings. For this reason, in order to be able to give an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee considers that it would be very helpful for it to have the ruling given by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice on the dismissals that have been challenged. It also wishes to be informed of the ruling on the criminal proceedings initiated by the company against the ten trade union officials. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply the text of these rulings as soon as they are handed down.
.With regard to the ruling that the strikes initiated by members of the CST-affiliated union were illegal, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the ruling was based on sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. In this regard, the Committee notes that it does not consider legislation which provides for voluntary conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called as an infringement of freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, para. ]. It would appear that, in this case, all the strikes called were declared illegal by the Labour Inspectorate, but the Committee must underscore that the dismissal of the trade union leaders took place before the union had obtained legal personality, that is to say, in a situation in which the exercise of trade union activities was denied. For this reason, these trade union leaders cannot be reproached for not having fulfilled the legal conditions for the strike. Taking into account all these elements, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights can be freely exercised at CHENTEX Garments S.A. without the workers being subject to reprisals for their legitimate trade union activities.
.With regard to the allegations of trade union favouritism and refusal to bargain in good faith, the Committee notes, firstly, that within CHENTEX Garments S.A. two trade unions have been operating in parallel: the company union of CHENTEX (affiliated to the CST), and another union affiliated to the Nicaraguan Central Workers' Confederation (CNT). It also notes that the Government has not presented any observations on the statements made by the complainant organizations, in particular on the company's alleged indifference to appeals",1,2000,Nicaragua
57,"made by the CST (including by means of summonses from the Ministry of Labour) to comply with the collective agreement signed by both parties in August . It also notes that the Government, despite the reluctance of the employer in this matter, finally declared that the employer had complied with an agreement which, according to the complainants, was concluded only with the CNT-affiliated union and discriminated against members of the CST-affiliated union. In the light of these facts, the Committee is bound to emphasize the importance of the principle that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In accordance with this principle, the Committee reminds the Government that appropriate measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements [see Convention No. , Article ].
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In order to be able to give an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to supply the substance of the ruling handed down by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissals which were the subject of legal challenges, and of the ruling given by the criminal court dealing with the criminal proceedings initiated by the company against the ten trade union officials.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights can be freely exercised at CHENTEX Garments S.A. without the workers being subject to reprisals for their legitimate trade union activities.(c) The Committee is bound to emphasize the importance of the principle that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement. In accordance with this principle, the Committee reminds the Government that appropriate measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements.",1,2000,Nicaragua
58,".The Committee last examined this case, concerning the dismissal of a trade union official, at its meeting in March  [see th Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee drew up the following recommendations:(a) In order to be able to give an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to supply the substance of the ruling handed down by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissals which were the subject of legal challenges, and of the ruling given by the criminal court dealing with the criminal proceedings initiated by the company against the ten trade union officials.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights can be freely exercised at CHENTEX Garments S.A. without the workers being subject to reprisals for their legitimate trade union activities.(c) The Committee is bound to emphasize the importance of the principle that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement. In accordance with this principle, the Committee reminds the Government that appropriate measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements.
.In its communication of  April , the Government sent the Committee a copy of the ruling handed down by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissals which were the subject of legal challenges. This ruling ordered the reinstatement of nine trade unionists into their previous positions, under the same terms and conditions that had previously applied. As soon as the Government has been informed of the ruling handed down by the criminal court, it will send a copy to the Committee. The Government stated that the Ministry of Labour maintains a labour inspectorate in the export processing zone to ensure that workers are not subject to reprisals for carrying out their legitimate trade union activities, including employees at CHENTEX Garments S.A. Furthermore, the Government sent a copy of the collective agreement signed by the enterprise and the Trade Union of Independent Workers, which, in accordance with the country s labour laws, covers all workers of the enterprise. With its communication of  May , the Government attaches a copy of the agreement concluded by the company and the complainant organization whereby: all the labour and criminal proceedings currently pending are withdrawn; four trade union leaders are reinstated into their jobs; and the phased-in reinstatement of  other workers is planned. The parties to the agreement further agree to resort to negotiation and dialogue to settle disputes.
.The Committee notes this information with satisfaction.
.In their communications of  July,  August and  September , the ""Jos Benito Escobar"" Trade Union Confederation of Workers (CST) and the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation (ITGLWF) stated that in , the workers of the ""Las Mercedes"" export processing zones corporation began initiatives to form enterprise-level trade unions. According to them, on  January ,  employees of CHENTEX Garments S.A. held a general meeting with a view to establishing a trade union affiliated to the CST and appointing its executive committee. On  January,  workers at the enterprise were dismissed, including all members of the recently elected executive committee. On  January all the company's workers ( at the time) came out on strike to protest the dismissal of their colleagues, who were reinstated by the company on the same day. On  February, the trade union obtained legal personality and was entered on the appropriate register (although not within the period of ten days stipulated in section  of the Labour Code in force). Nevertheless, the same month, the company renewed its anti-union campaign and again dismissed the executive committee members as well as other company employees. On  February, these actions led to another strike which was immediately resolved in the same way as before.
.According to the complainant organization, two trade unions operated in the enterprise: the CHENTEX company trade union affiliated to the CST; and an autonomous union affiliated to the Nicaraguan Central Workers' Confederation (CNT), favoured by the enterprise. Indeed, one CST-affiliated union official stated that the company management had offered him money to change unions (to the CNT-affiliated union) and had dismissed him when he refused. Gradually, hundreds of workers who supported the CST-affiliated union were forced to leave it on threats of dismissal. Recent recruits were asked to join the CNT-affiliated union, and one CST-affiliated union official was forced to resign after being blackmailed. In addition, workers employed in the export processing zone suffered attacks, including physical assaults, and the Ministry of Labour interfered in the union's activities through spies and strike-breakers. The CNT-affiliated union distributed pamphlets calling into question the integrity of the other union's officials, and despite the latter's complaints the authorities did nothing. Finally, according to a former CHENTEX employee, the Deputy Minister of Labour told the press (in May ) that Taiwanese investors had threatened to close down their operations in the export processing zone if the Ministry of Labour came down in favour of the CST-affiliated union.
.In this context, the company concluded a collective agreement with both unions (in August ), by which it committed itself in an ""instrument of accord"" to review wages within a period of less than one year and to review transport and food subsidies in the light of available resources. Despite this, the head of the company on  June  again refused to enter into talks with the CST-affiliated union, although it had undertaken to do so. On  August, the union therefore presented a list of demands (signed by  workers) to the Ministry of Labour which passed it on to the company and called the parties together on a number of occasions between  January and  March . Although CHENTEX did not come to the talks, it did sign an agreement in the meantime with the autonomous CNT-affiliated union under which it agreed to review the wages of all the workers; the Conciliation Department of the Ministry of Labour rejected an application from the CST-affiliated union to declare the company in default, and indeed declared that the company had complied with the agreement, since it had offered a  per cent increase to  per cent of the workforce with effect from  March . Under these circumstances, the CST-affiliated union on  April challenged the company's account of the wage increase on the grounds that it had been agreed exclusively with the CNT-affiliated union and discriminated against members of the CST-affiliated union. It then initiated the appropriate proceedings with the Ministry of Labour (under section  of the Labour Code) to begin strike action, but it was forced to begin again when its application was disregarded (still without success).
.On  April the CST-affiliated union called a strike in protest at the refusal by CHENTEX to bargain in good faith. Although all the workers were at their posts when labour inspectors entered the plant to assess the situation, the Ministry of Labour informed the union's leaders on  May that the company was seeking the termination of their contracts of employment on the grounds of failure to perform their duties. Following a protest strike on the same day (in which  workers took part, not , as claimed by the Government), the company on  May hired a group of youths from a problem neighbourhood to cause disruption. Finally, on  May the Ministry of Labour authorized the dismissal of nine trade union officials who challenged the ruling in an appeal and amparo proceedings; a final ruling is still awaited. In this context, the company on  June  asked the labour tribunal to dissolve the CST-affiliated union on the grounds that it had fewer members than the number required by law (following successive reviews, only one official and two ordinary members remained at the enterprise). On  June the company initiated criminal proceedings against ten union officials for offences punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment without any possibility of commutation. On  June the members of the CHENTEX union declared that they would not hold elections until these cases were resolved.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that on  July , the administration of CHENTEX Garments S.A. petitioned the General Labour Inspectorate to apply the appropriate legal procedures to declare illegal the strike that had been called that day by company workers. It stated that some  per cent of the workers supported the strike for reasons of solidarity with workers dismissed from another textile company located in the same zone, because of the alleged failure to comply with the collective agreement and in order to force the company to allow negotiations in the enterprise with the participation of a trade union representative.
.Also on  July, following an",1,2000,Nicaragua
59,"on-site inspection, the enterprise was found to be paralysed and accordingly, on  July, the Labour Inspectorate ruled that the strike called by the union's executive committee was illegal since the latter had not complied with sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. According to these provisions, for a strike to be called, the relevant conciliation procedure with the Ministry of Labour must have been exhausted, the strike must be agreed at a general meeting of the workers and conducted in a peaceful manner by the majority of workers inside or outside the enterprise or establishment. Under the terms of the Code, striking workers were told that they would have to resume work within  hours of the ruling, and that the employer would terminate the employment contracts of any workers who continued to strike illegally.
.On  August, the company again petitioned the Labour Inspectorate to declare illegal the strike of  workers of the  who worked in the garment pressing area, since they, too, had failed to follow the procedure set out in section  of the Labour Code. Workers were on strike in protest at the termination of the employment contracts of Juan Baltodano and Juan Merenco. Following an on-site inspection, labour inspectors informed the workers that the employer could rescind a contract of employment under the terms of section  of the Labour Code (for an indeterminate period and without giving any reason), and that they could not withdraw their labour without first exhausting the procedure established under section  of the Labour Code. For this reason, the stoppage was not valid; the workers were told that any employee whose contract of employment was revoked could appeal to a competent judge for a ruling as to whether or not there were grounds for reinstatement, and it was not in the power of the Ministry of Labour to order a worker's reinstatement. On  August , the General Labour Inspectorate ruled that the strike directed by the executive committee of the CHENTEX union was illegal, and the striking workers were informed that they would have to resume work within  hours or their contracts of employment would be terminated by the employer in accordance with sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code.
.On  April , the CST-affiliated union and the other trade union involved discussed the wage claims with the company administration but no agreement was reached. On  April, the members of the union's executive committee left their workplaces for one hour and were told by the company that they had to exhaust the available statutory procedures. On  April, the company administration applied for the cancellation of the employment contracts of Gladis Manzanares, Santiago Villalobos, Flix Rosales Garca, Harlling Bobadilla Treminio, Blanca Torrez Seas, Roberto Manzanares, Maura Parson, Zeneyda Torres and Flix Sanches. They were summoned to a hearing but did not appear, and instead called on the other workers to stop work in protest at the notice. On  May the strikers resorted to damaging property, intimidation and violence. On  May they appeared before the local labour inspectorate (agricultural and industrial department). They did not deny the claims made by the company administration, which supported its demands for dismissal with written evidence and witness statements. On  May they were reinstated in their posts, but the Labour Inspectorate authorized the cancellation of the contracts of employment of the nine workers. Notification was received on  May and the workers appealed. The Labour Inspectorate passed the case on to the Minister of Labour to allow him to appoint an ad hoc General Labour Inspector. The latter dismissed the appeal and upheld the original ruling for dismissal on the grounds that the employer had shown that there were grounds for dismissal. On  July the ad hoc General Labour Inspector was informed of the ruling handed down by the Constitutional Division (Region III Managua) of the Supreme Court regarding the amparo proceedings initiated by Gladis Manzanares Tercero, Santiago Villalobos and others in their capacity as workers of CHENTEX Garments S.A. On  August the Labour Inspectorate sent the Court the report which the latter had requested and the matter is currently still pending before the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court.
.On  June the administration of CHENTEX asked the Labour Inspectorate to verify the current situation of the CST-affiliated union, given that a number of workers of the enterprise had allegedly resigned from it. It was found that of the  workers who had taken part in the most recent extraordinary general meeting,  had resigned from the company,  had been dismissed, three had put two signatures, two had written their names illegibly,  had left the union and two remained members. This clearly explains why the union is currently registered with the trade union associations directorate as ""inactive"", since in addition,  of the union officials who had formed the executive committee, only one female official remains active, the other  having been dismissed for contravening the terms of their contracts of employment and causing damage to the company (the company initiated legal proceedings against them on  June  for breaches of trade freedom, freedom to work and freedom of association, extortion, rioting, incitement to violence and conspiracy).
.With regard to the allegation of wrongful dismissals for anti-union reasons, the Committee notes that, according to the complainants, a number of employees of the textile company CHENTEX Garments S.A. on  January  joined forces to establish a company trade union affiliated to the ""Jos Benito Escobar"" Trade Union Confederation of Workers (CST) but that this initiative was restricted by a series of anti-union acts which began on  January with the dismissal without any apparent reason of  employees (including all the officers of the new union), which was followed by another dismissal of executive committee members, and ended in June , when the company sought the dissolution of the union after the competent authority had found that only one officer and a few members remained in it. The Committee notes that, according to the complainants, the inadmissibility of the dismissals in question lies in the fact that they were associated with the establishment of the CST-affiliated union, were supposedly motivated by the strikes that had taken place, and reflected the wish of the company to liquidate the union, whose officers (except one) and many of whose members had been dismissed.
.The Committee notes the arguments put forward by the complainant organization to demonstrate the anti-union nature of the dismissals, and is bound to note that during the past two years, many measures were adopted against the officials and members of the CST-affiliated union, including criminal proceedings. For this reason, in order to be able to give an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee considers that it would be very helpful for it to have the ruling given by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice on the dismissals that have been challenged. It also wishes to be informed of the ruling on the criminal proceedings initiated by the company against the ten trade union officials. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply the text of these rulings as soon as they are handed down.
.With regard to the ruling that the strikes initiated by members of the CST-affiliated union were illegal, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the ruling was based on sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. In this regard, the Committee notes that it does not consider legislation which provides for voluntary conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called as an infringement of freedom of association [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, para. ]. It would appear that, in this case, all the strikes called were declared illegal by the Labour Inspectorate, but the Committee must underscore that the dismissal of the trade union leaders took place before the union had obtained legal personality, that is to say, in a situation in which the exercise of trade union activities was denied. For this reason, these trade union leaders cannot be reproached for not having fulfilled the legal conditions for the strike. Taking into account all these elements, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights can be freely exercised at CHENTEX Garments S.A. without the workers being subject to reprisals for their legitimate trade union activities.
.With regard to the allegations of trade union favouritism and refusal to bargain in good faith, the Committee notes, firstly, that within CHENTEX Garments S.A. two trade unions have been operating in parallel: the company union of CHENTEX (affiliated to the CST), and another union affiliated to the Nicaraguan Central Workers' Confederation (CNT). It also notes that the Government has not presented any observations on the statements made by the complainant organizations, in particular on the company's alleged indifference to appeals",1,2000,Nicaragua
60,"made by the CST (including by means of summonses from the Ministry of Labour) to comply with the collective agreement signed by both parties in August . It also notes that the Government, despite the reluctance of the employer in this matter, finally declared that the employer had complied with an agreement which, according to the complainants, was concluded only with the CNT-affiliated union and discriminated against members of the CST-affiliated union. In the light of these facts, the Committee is bound to emphasize the importance of the principle that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. In accordance with this principle, the Committee reminds the Government that appropriate measures should be taken to encourage and promote the full development and utilization of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organizations and workers' organizations, with a view to the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements [see Convention No. , Article ].
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) In order to be able to give an opinion in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to supply the substance of the ruling handed down by the main Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissals which were the subject of legal challenges, and of the ruling given by the criminal court dealing with the criminal proceedings initiated by the company against the ten trade union officials.(b) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that trade union rights can be freely exercised at CHENTEX Garments S.A. without the workers being subject to reprisals for their legitimate trade union activities.(c) The Committee is bound to emphasize the importance of the principle that both employers and trade unions bargain in good faith and make every effort to reach an agreement.

61,".The Committee last examined this case, relating to unjustified dismissals of trade union officials, at its November  meeting [see rd Report, paras. -]. On that occasion the Committee urged the Government to ensure that the trade union official Mr. Osabas Varela was reinstated in his post at the El Relampago plantation and any back wage owed to him paid. The Committee also requested the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard. Likewise, noting that both the administrative and the judicial authorities had ordered the reinstatement of the union officials dismissed at the Emma plantation, the Committee urged the Government to ensure that Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales were reinstated in their posts and any back wages paid. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government informs the Committee that the situation has not changed because the parties to the dispute have not exhausted the legal means provided for in national legislation to resolve social and labour disputes. The Government recalls that the complainant organization is obliged to proceed with the legal proceedings in place for the protection of workers' rights, given the limited scope of these matters in both space and time.
.The Committee notes this information with regret and again requests the Government to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that Mr. Osabas Varela, Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales are reinstated in their posts and any back wages paid.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in March  and on that occasion presented an interim report to the Governing Body (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in March ). The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  June .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, when it considered allegations concerning unjustified dismissals of trade union officials, the Committee requested the Government to ensure the reinstatement of the trade union official Mr. Juan Osabas Varela, to send its observations on the alleged dismissals of the other members of the executive committee of the trade union at the El Relmpago plantation, and to inform it of any ruling handed down on the claim by the trade union officials at the Emma plantation, Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales, for reinstatement and payment of back wages.
.Firstly, the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the following principles relating to acts of anti-union discrimination against trade union officials and members: ""The government is responsible for preventing all acts of anti-union discrimination"", and ""In cases of the dismissal of trade unionists on the grounds of their trade union membership or activities, the Committee has requested the government to take the necessary measures to enable trade union leaders and members who had been dismissed due to their legitimate trade union activities to secure reinstatement in their jobs and to ensure the application against the enterprises concerned of the corresponding legal sanctions"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , paras.  and ).
.With regard to the reinstatement of the trade union official Mr. Juan Osabas Varela at the El Relmpago plantation, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that, as it informed the Committee on a previous occasion, the Chinandega District Labour Inspectorate refused the application to dismiss the official in question because it considered that there were no grounds for dismissal, and that it was the responsibility of the parties concerned to exhaust all available legal means of enforcing any ruling or decision. In this regard, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not taken the necessary measures to ensure the reinstatement of the trade union official Mr. Juan Osabas Varela - whose dismissal was overruled two years ago by the administrative authorities - which the Committee had requested at its meeting in March . Under these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that Mr. Juan Osabas Varela is reinstated in his post and that any back wages owed to him are paid. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of the other members of the executive committee of the trade union at the El Relmpago plantation, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that no other executive committee members have been dismissed apart from Mr. Varela. Under these circumstances, noting that the complainant has not provided any specific details (names, posts held, etc.) of these alleged dismissals, the Committee will not pursue its examination of this allegation.
.As regards the court application brought by the trade union officials of the Emma plantation, Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales, in connection with their dismissals, the Committee notes that there have been decisions by the Chinandega District Labour Inspectorate and a ruling by the El Viejo Court ordering the reinstatement of the officials in question and payment of any back wages owed to them; the officials must exhaust available legal means of ensuring that the decisions and/or ruling are enforced. In this regard, noting that both the administrative and the judicial authorities have ordered the reinstatement of the union officials dismissed at the Emma plantation, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales are reinstated in their posts and any back wages paid. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that the trade union official Mr. Osabas Varela is reinstated in his post at the El Relmpago plantation and any back wage owed to him paid. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.(b) Noting that both the administrative and the judicial authorities have ordered the reinstatement of the union officials dismissed at the Emma plantation, the Committee urges the Government to ensure that Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales are reinstated in their posts and any back wages paid. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  June  from the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF). That organization sent additional information in a communication dated  July . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  June and  July , the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) alleges that in October  the members of the executive committee of the Fransisco Prado Blanco trade union representing workers at the Alfonso y Angelina banana plantation were dismissed. The IUF adds that the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour, following a long inquiry, issued a ruling on  January  ordering the reinstatement of the executive committee members in their posts until a definitive ruling on the matter could be given. Despite this, the plantation owner came to an arrangement with the local inspector and has ignored the ruling.
.The IUF also alleges that the members of the executive committee of the trade union at the El Relmpago plantation, which has the same owner as the Alfonso y Angelina plantation, were dismissed in October  and have not been reinstated. This has deprived workers on the plantation of a trade union.
.The IUF also alleges that at the beginning of May , without any good reason and in an arbitrary manner, the employment contracts of Mr. Manuel Jess Canales Morales and Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes, officials of the Hroes y Mrtires de Septiembre trade union representing workers at the Emma banana plantation, were terminated. In a ruling dated  June , the Chinandega District Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour overruled the dismissals and ordered the immediate reinstatement of the workers concerned and payment of any back pay owed to them. Despite this, the plantation manager ignored the ruling when the two officials reported to their place of work on  July . The IUF claims that a charge against the officials was fabricated and unsubstantiated and that the fundamental reason for their dismissal was their position as trade union officials. The IUF supplies a copy of a communication dated  May  from the plantation director to",1,1999,Nicaragua
62,"the District Labour Inspector requesting the dismissal of the officials and accusing them of theft and abuse of trust. It also supplies a copy of the Inspector's ruling of  June  refusing permission for the dismissals.
.In its communication of  November , the Government supplies a copy of the rulings of the General Labour Inspectorate and of certain judicial proceedings relating to the allegations. As regards the alleged dismissal of seven executive committee members of the Fransisco Jos Prado Blanco trade union at the Alfonso y Angelina plantation, a ruling of  February , which was upheld on appeal on  February , authorized the dismissals on the grounds that there were good reasons for them. According to the ruling, it had been established that the workers interrupted their work on ,  and  September  and incited other workers to stop work. Also according to the ruling, the dismissed workers agreed that they had used work time to put forward demands without obtaining permission from management to interrupt work, and the plantation had incurred losses.
.As regards the alleged dismissals of the members of the executive committee of the El Relmpago plantation, the Government indicates that in a ruling dated  June  the Chinandega District Labour Inspectorate refused permission to dismiss trade union official Juan Osabas Bareta on the basis that there were no grounds for doing so.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union officials at the Emma banana plantation (Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel Jess Canales), the Government states that a ruling of the Chinandega District Labour Inspectorate on  June , which was upheld on appeal by a ruling of the General Labour Inspectorate on  July , refused permission for such dismissals on the basis that there were no grounds for doing so (the courts have still not proven the charge of theft and abuse of trust on the part of the union officials, or that the latter caused financial loss to the plantation). The matter was subsequently brought before the courts (the Government supplies a copy of the judicial proceedings that have taken place so far) because the officials were not reinstated by the company and did not receive the back pay owed to them.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint the complainant alleges dismissals of trade union officials at the Alfonso y Angelina, El Relmpago and Emma banana plantations.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government (which has supplied copies of Labour Inspectorate rulings), the seven trade union officials dismissed at the Alfonso y Angelina plantation used work time to put forward demands, interrupting work without permission and inciting other workers to stop work. The Committee also notes that the Labour Inspectorate refused permission to dismiss trade union official Juan Osabas Bareta of the El Relmpago plantation for want of adequate reasons. In this regard the Committee notes that the complainant referred not to one dismissal only but to the dismissal of all the members of the executive committee of the trade union at the El Relmpago plantation. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to ensure the reinstatement of trade union leader Juan Osabas Bareta and to send its observations on the alleged dismissals of the other members of the executive committee. As regards the dismissal of Mr. Bayardo Mungua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales (at the Emma plantation), the Committee notes that the Labour Inspectorate rulings refused permission for such dismissals on the basis that there were no grounds for dismissal. The Committee notes that this matter has been brought before the courts by the union officials in question because the plantation refuses to reinstate them and pay the back wages owed to them, and requests the Government to inform it of any ruling given on the matter. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the enterprises concerned reinstate without delay the workers for whom the labour inspectorate had ordered reinstatement and payment of the wages owed.
.In general terms, the Committee draws attention to the principle according to which ""(n)o person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th (revised) edition, , para. ). Given that in the present complaint it has been established that administrative rulings for the reinstatement of trade union officials in their posts on the Emma plantation have been ignored, the Committee emphasizes that ""(t)he basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to ensure the reinstatement of trade union leader Juan Osabas Bareta and to send its observations on the alleged dismissals of the other members of the executive committee of the trade union at the El Relmpago plantation.(b) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of any ruling given on the application for reinstatement and payment of back wages presented by the trade union officials at the Emma plantation (Mr. Bayardo Mangua Fuentes and Mr. Manuel de Jess Canales).(c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the enterprises concerned reinstate without delay the workers for whom the labour inspectorate had ordered reinstatement and payment of the wages owed.",1,1999,Nicaragua
63,".The Committee last examined this case, relating, in particular, to anti-union dismissals, at its June  meeting [see st Report, paras. -]. On that occasion, the Committee, after having noted that the workers who had accepted settlements could not be reinstated as the matter had been resolved once and for all, made the following conclusions and recommendations:The Committee regrets that the Government has not interceded on behalf of the  dismissed workers and recalls the principle that it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. , is granted by legislation in cases where employers can, in practice, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, dismiss any worker, if the true reason is the worker s trade union membership or activities.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government sent the ruling of the Appeals Court, Managua District, Labour Division, dated  May . By virtue of this, the Nicaraguan Telecommunications Company (ENTEL) shall reinstate, within three days of notification of the decision to the plaintiffs, Plcido H. Rojas Vlchez, Mario Rafael Malespn Martnez (who had trade union privileges) and Yarbn Jos Roa Vallejos in the same positions that they held and in identical working conditions, with the corresponding payment of the usual salaries owing to each one of them from the date of their dismissal until their reinstatement. The plaintiffs shall collect the social allowances and benefits to which they are entitled, in accordance with the law and the collective labour agreement in force.
.The Committee notes this information and repeats once again the principle mentioned in its previous conclusions and recommendations.
.The Committee last examined this case, which concerns dismissals and other anti-union measures - seizure of union offices and confiscation of property - at its meeting in November  [see th Report, paras. -]. At the time the Committee had made the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requested the Government to endeavour to secure the reinstatement of the  dismissed workers, at least until the courts have given a ruling on the matter.(b) The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed of developments in the collective talks at ENITEL.(c) The Committee requested the Government to carry out an independent investigation into the seizure of trade union premises and the confiscation of trade union papers and other property in Len, Chinandega, Granada and Matagalpa by paramilitary units and, if these allegations are found to be true, to take the necessary measures to ensure the immediate return of the premises, papers and property to the trade unions concerned and to ensure that the persons responsible are brought before the competent court.(d) The Committee requested the Government to take measures to begin an independent inquiry into the allegations concerning pressure in the form of threats of dismissal to persuade workers to relinquish the benefits of the collective agreement and their representation by the complainant and, if they are found to be true, to ensure that these workers in positions of trust can choose freely whether or not to be covered by the collective agreement and be represented by the trade union organization.(e) The Committee requested the Government to take measures to carry out an independent investigation into the allegations concerning the pressure applied to force workers to leave the complainant organization and, if the allegations are found to be true, to take appropriate steps to apply administrative and legal sanctions and to prevent any future recurrence of such acts. The Committee requested the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In a communication dated  March concerning the reinstatement of the  dismissed workers, the Government states that the authorization to dismiss a number of former employees of ENITEL for abandoning their duties on  October  was justified. Moreover, the  workers who accepted settlements cannot be reinstated as the matter has been resolved once and for all. Regarding the workers who did not accept settlements, on the other hand, the Government cannot determine whether or not their reinstatement is justified, even temporarily, as that would constitute interference by the Executive in matters that come within the purview of Judiciary. Finally, the Government states that the workers and employers reached a satisfactory agreement in the course of the conciliation procedure, wherein the workers negotiated and accepted the conditions of their cessation of work and explicitly notified the judicial authorities that they were abandoning their demand for reinstatement.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not interceded on behalf of the dismissed workers and recalls the principle that it would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, as set out in Convention No. , is granted by legislation in cases where employers can in practice, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, dismiss any worker, if the true reason is the worker's trade union membership or activities [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ].
.The Government further states that ENITEL signed a new collective agreement with the complainant organization and its two other trade union associations on  February  (the new trade union executive board took up office on  January ).
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Regarding the allegations that trade union premises were seized and various trade union papers confiscated, the Government states that there are no paramilitary units in Nicaragua and that no trade union premises were seized.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not provided any information on the outcome of the administrative appeal lodged by the complainant organization in this respect or on the findings of the independent investigation into these allegations that had been requested. The Committee therefore recalls that the right of the inviolability of trade union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities may not insist on entering such premises without prior authorization of their occupants or without having obtained a legal warrant to do so [see Digest, op. cit., para. ].
.The Government further gives its assurances that no pressure was exercised on the workers to induce them to relinquish the benefits of the collective agreement with ENITEL and also that no pressure was brought to bear on the workers to force them to leave the complainant organization.
.The Committee observes that, in its reply, the Government does not provide sufficient information concerning the pressure allegedly brought to bear on the workers to persuade them to relinquish their representation by the complainant organization and to leave it, or to the outcome of the independent inquiry that had been called for into these allegations. It recalls that when examining various cases in which workers who refuse to give up the right to collective negotiation were denied [certain rights], the Committee considered that it raised significant problems of compatibility with the principles of freedom of association, in particular as regards Article ()(b) of Convention No.  [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. It also emphasizes that workers [...] without distinction whatsoever have the right to establish and [...] to join organizations of their own choosing without previous authorization [see Article  of Convention No. ].
.El Comit toma nota de esta comunicacin.
.The complaint in the present case is contained in a communication dated  March  from the ""Enrique Schmidt Cuadra"" Federation of Communications and Postal Workers. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  August .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  March , the ""Enrique Schmidt Cuadra"" Federation of Communications and Postal Workers states that on  May  it submitted a list of demands to the Ministry of Labour with a view to negotiating a new collective agreement within the Nicaraguan Telecommunications Company (ENITEL). After  months of talks, in which two other trade union organizations of the company participated, deadlock was reached by October . The complainant states that on  October  it organized a day of protest, which meant convening meetings of workers throughout the country to inform them that talks had reached deadlock, and that when the meetings ended workers were prevented from going back to work. According to the complainant, from this moment onwards there began a campaign of repression and defamation directed against it. Specifically, the complainant alleges the following:-- the dismissal of  workers including  union officials (according to the complainant, the company took advantage of damage caused by ""Hurricane Mitch"" to accuse the dismissed workers of causing damage in the company);-- the seizure of union offices in Len, Chinandega, Granada and Matagalpa, as well as the confiscation of union documents and other property;-- the use of pressure on workers to force them to leave the union organization;-- the use of pressure in the form of threats of dismissal in order to force workers to relinquish the benefits of the",1,1999,Nicaragua
64,"collective agreement and the representation by the complainant.
.Lastly, the complainant states that there has been no progress in the administrative actions initiated in connection with the allegations and that although five applications have been brought before the courts to secure the reinstatement of the dismissed workers,  of the workers affected have been forced on economic grounds to accept the settlements.
.In its communication of  August , the Government states that on  May  the ""Enrique Schmidt Cuadra"" Federation of Communications and Postal Workers, the National Union of Telecommunications and Postal Workers (SINTRATELCO) and the ""Eighth of April"" Trade Union submitted a list of demands to the district inspectorate for the construction, transport and telecommunications sector with a view to negotiating a collective agreement with the Nicaraguan Telecommunications Company (ENITEL), following an initial meeting on  June . The Government states that by  October  only four clauses remained to be negotiated. The Government explains that the Labour Code provides for a period of  days for negotiating a collective agreement, but that in practice the period is extended, which leads to the parties becoming aggressive in their demands as talks progress and this creates a climate of distrust. Faced with such a situation, the Ministry of Labour started conciliation proceedings with a view to ending the deadlock. The Government indicates that in the present case, after the parties had been called on to continue talks on  October , the workers of the ""Enrique Schmidt Cuadra"" Federation carried out a stoppage in most sections of ENITEL on  October . Following these events, the Ministry of Labour called on the parties to continue talks, which are still in progress. The Government states that during the negotiating sessions a group of workers in positions of trust (more than ) in ENITEL asked to be excluded from the terms of the collective agreement and requested that no trade union body represent them in the talks. The parties to the talks requested the Ministry of Labour to give a ruling on these requests. A ruling was given and two of the three trade union organizations involved in the talks appealed against it; the appeal did not interrupt the talks, the last session of which took place on  June . The Government states that the parties to the talks have been using delaying tactics, and that numerous reasons are given for impeding progress in the talks.
.As regards the allegations concerning the dismissals of workers following the day of protest in the company ENITEL, the Government states that these occurred following a work stoppage during which members of the ""Enrique Schmidt Cuadra"" Federation abandoned their posts. This stoppage involved actions aimed at disrupting and hindering the company's technical and administrative operations of providing a public telephone service. These actions were accompanied by acts of violence which resulted in damage being done to company vehicles and disrespect being shown to management and to other company workers. Entrances to company premises in Managua and at various branches throughout the country were blocked, thus preventing non-protesting workers and customers from getting in. The Government adds that the workers broke the company's internal regulations and violated the Labour Code and their own contracts of employment, and that for this reason ENITEL sought the cancellation of the employment contracts of workers who had participated in the day of protest. The Government emphasizes that actions which prevent the State from meeting its obligations to provide the basic services listed in article  of the Constitution, including communications services, cannot be tolerated.
.Lastly, the Government states that as regards the allegations concerning the seizure by paramilitary units of trade union premises in Len, Chinandega, Granada and Matagalpa and the confiscation of union documents and property, no complaints concerning such allegations have been received by the administrative authorities.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, the complainant alleges that during talks on a collective agreement in the Nicaraguan Telecommunications Company (ENITEL) which have been in progress for more than two years, it called a day of protest and that from that moment onwards a campaign of repression and defamation against it began. Specifically, the complainant alleges the following: () the dismissal of  workers including  union officials; () the seizure of union offices in Len, Chinandega, Granada and Matagalpa as well as the confiscation of union papers and other property; () the use of pressure to force workers to relinquish union membership; () the use of pressure in the form of threats of dismissal in order to force workers to relinquish the benefits of the collective agreement and the representation by the complainant.
.As regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of  ENITEL workers ( of whom have accepted settlements) including  union officials following a day of protest on  October , the Committee notes that the versions of events given by the complainant and the Government are mutually contradictory. While the complainant alleges that the dismissals were part of a campaign of anti-union repression which started after the talks on a collective agreement had reached deadlock, and that the authorities took advantage of damage caused by ""Hurricane Mitch"" to accuse workers of causing damage in the company, the Government maintains that the workers were dismissed for just cause on the grounds that they had withdrawn their labour, thereby breaking the company's internal regulations and violating the provisions of the Labour Code and the Constitution concerning the provision of a basic service, and had caused damage to company equipment.
.In this regard the Committee recalls that it has already had occasion to state that telephone services may be regarded as essential services in the strict sense of the term, i.e. services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population, and that it has admitted that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in services of this type, but that the workers must have appropriate guarantees to compensate them (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras. ,  and ). However, the Committee also recalls that on a number of occasions it has stated that postal services do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). In this context, the Committee considers that the following points must be taken into consideration: () the dismissals occurred during collective talks which began more than two years ago and which are still in progress and that, according to the Government, both parties have used delaying tactics; and () the dismissed workers have initiated legal action to secure their reinstatement, although no ruling on this has yet been handed down. Under these circumstances, in order to ensure that the parties can conclude the collective agreement in a harmonious working climate, the Committee requests the Government to endeavour to secure the reinstatement of the trade union officials and workers who were dismissed, at least until the courts give a ruling on the matter. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In this regard, recalling the importance of participation in good faith by both employers and unions, and of their doing all in their power to reach an agreement, and that genuine and constructive talks are necessary for creating and maintaining a relationship of confidence between the parties (see Digest, op. cit., para. ), the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in the collective talks at the company ENITEL.
.As regards the allegation concerning the seizure of union premises and the confiscation of union papers and other property in Len, Chinandega, Granada and Matagalpa by paramilitary units, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that the administrative authorities have received no complaints regarding these allegations. In this regard the Committee stresses that a climate of violence as reflected in attacks by paramilitary units against union premises and property constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights, and for this reason such acts should be met with severe measures by the authorities, in particular by bringing the persons responsible before the competent judicial authority. To this end the Committee requests the Government to institute an independent investigation into these allegations and, if they are found to be true, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the union premises, papers and other property are returned and to ensure that those responsible are brought before the competent courts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.As regards the allegation of pressure brought to bear by senior management in the form of threats of dismissal to persuade workers to relinquish the benefits of the collective agreement, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government, according to which: (i) a group of  workers in positions of trust asked to be excluded from the terms of the collective agreement and not to be",-1,1999,Nicaragua
65,"represented by any trade union organization; and (ii) the parties sought a ruling on this from the administrative authority which, in its decision of  May , ruled that the workers in question did not have to be covered by the terms of the collective agreement (an appeal against the decision was lodged by two of the three unions involved). In this regard the Committee notes that the Government does not refer to the alleged pressure in the form of threats of dismissal to force workers to relinquish the benefits of the collective agreement and representation by the complainant. The Committee considers that it may be difficult for a worker in a position of trust to provide proof that pressure has been exerted to induce him to relinquish the benefits of a collective agreement or the representation by a trade union organization. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that an independent inquiry is conducted into these allegations and, if the allegations are found to be true, to ensure that the workers in question can choose freely whether or not to be covered by the terms of the collective agreement and represented by a trade union organization. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the final outcome of the complainant's appeal on the matter.
.As regards the allegation that workers in the complainant organization were subjected to pressure to force them to leave it, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided its own observations on the matter. The Committee recalls the importance of Article  of Convention No.  on the need to provide workers with adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, including acts calculated to force workers to relinquish trade union membership. Under these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out in this matter and, if the allegations are found to be true, to ensure that appropriate action is taken to ensure that administrative and legal sanctions are applied and to prevent a recurrence of such acts in future. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the dismissals of  workers ( of whom have accepted settlements), including trade union officials at the Nicaraguan Telecommunications Company (ENITEL) the Committee, taking into consideration the contradictory versions given by the complainant and the Government of the events which led to the dismissals, requests the Government to endeavour to secure the reinstatement of the workers, at least until the courts have given a ruling on the matter. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(b) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the collective talks at ENITEL.(c) As regards the seizure of trade union premises and confiscation of trade union papers and other property at Len, Chinandega, Granada and Matagalpa by paramilitary units, the Committee requests the Government to carry out an independent investigation into these allegations and, if they are found to be true, to take the necessary measures to ensure the immediate return of the premises and property and to ensure that the persons responsible are brought before the competent court. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(d) As regards the allegation concerning pressure in the form of threats of dismissal to persuade workers to relinquish the benefits of the collective agreement and the representation by the complainant, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to begin an independent inquiry into these allegations and, if they are found to be true, to ensure that these workers in positions of trust can choose freely whether or not to be covered by the collective agreement and be represented by the trade union organization. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the administrative appeal lodged by the complainant in this matter.(e) As regards the allegation concerning the pressure applied to force workers to leave the complainant organization, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to carry out an independent investigation in this regard and, if the allegations are found to be true, to take appropriate steps to apply administrative and legal sanctions and to prevent any future recurrence of such acts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.",1,1999,Nicaragua
66,".The complaints in this case are contained in communications from the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) and the Federation of Mining Trade Unions of Nicaragua (FESIMINI) dated  May and  June , respectively. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  September .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May  the CST alleges that, by administrative decision of the Ministry of Labour, the main union leaders of FESIMINI and all the workers of the Nicaraguan Institute of Mines (INMINE) have been dismissed. The complainant organization alleges that the Government gave as grounds for the dismissals the enterprise's lack of liquid assets and that it ordered its closure, whereas in fact the decision was intended as a reprisal against the trade union leaders for criticizing the privatization of Nicaraguan mines. The complainant organization adds that, although the closure of the enterprise was said to be for reasons of force majeure, it had been reopened, new workers had been recruited and its headquarters had been relocated.
.In a communication dated  June , FESIMINI - which is affiliated to the CST - states that the Court of Appeals upheld the dismissed workers' constitutional rights and ordered the suspension of the dismissals allowed by the administrative authority. The Court based its decision on the fact that ""the dismissals caused irreparable damage to the appellants and the lack of authority against which they are appealing is beyond question"".
.In its communication dated  September , the Government states that the employer requested the administrative authority to cancel  contracts of employment by virtue of section , paragraph , of the Labour Code, which refers to the termination of a contract of employment on account of force majeure or an unforeseen event. The Government adds that the Labour Inspectorate found the request of the employer to be legitimate and authorized the cancellation of the contracts. The Government goes on to say that, although the Court of Appeals indicated the de facto and de jure grounds for upholding the constitutional rights of the dismissed workers and ordering the suspension of the administrative decision, it is apparent, from a review of the steps taken by the Ministry of Labour official who took the decision against which the appeal was lodged, that he proceeded in accordance with the law and with the information that was available to him at the time.
.Finally, the Government states that, subsequent to the Court decision, the parties concerned (including FESIMINI, the complainant organization) reached a written agreement on  July  (after the submission of the complaint) which put an end to the collective dispute by providing for compensation and other benefits for the workers (the Government attaches the text of the agreement signed inter alia by the secretary-general of FESIMINI, originator of the complaint lodged with the ILO).
.The Committee observes that the complainants alleged that trade union leaders and workers of the Nicaraguan Institute of Mines (INMINE) were dismissed on false grounds of force majeure (closure of the institute for lack of liquid assets). The Committee also notes that the complainants themselves state that the dismissals concerned all the workers and not only the trade union leaders. However, the Committee considers that the circumstances in this case - the closure of the Institute and its reopening with new workers - could constitute an act of anti-union discrimination. In any event, the Committee notes with interest that, subsequent to the closure of the Institute, the parties concerned reached a written agreement that provides for the payment of compensation and other benefits to the workers.
.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1994,Nicaragua
67,".The complaint is contained in a joint communication from the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets and the ""Carlos Fonseca Amador"" Service and Trade Federation, dated  March . The Government responded in a communication of  June .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets and the ""Carlos Fonseca Amador"" Service and Trade Federation allege in their joint communication of  March  that the manager of the Extra Supermarkets company dismissed members of the executive committee of the complainant trade union (Carlos Espinoza and Estrella Baca) without obtaining the necessary ""lifting of trade union immunity"" (authorization) from the Labour Inspectorate, and that the job security of members is being threatened if they continue their membership in the trade union. The complainants add that the manager of this company has filed a request with the judicial authorities for the dissolution of this trade union.
.In its communication of  June  the Government states that the Ministry of Labour has acted in accordance with the law and in an impartial manner. This is proven, for example, by the fact that the Labour Inspectorate issued a resolution ordering the reinstatement of the trade union leader Mrs. Estrella Baca, who was mentioned in the allegations.
.The Government adds that, after this action was taken, the management of Extra Supermarkets appealed to the Ministry of Labour, alleging that the trade union did not meet the requirements of the law. The Directorate for Trade Union Associations issued an order to inspect the enterprise's premises in order to ascertain whether the requirements of the Labour Code and the Regulations on Trade Union Associations were fulfilled. The findings of the inspection are contained in a document of  February . The inspection found that, of the  workers who initially formed the trade union, only  active members remained, as four were dismissed (including Carlos Espinoza), one was transferred to another branch of the enterprise and later dismissed, one was dismissed and did not hold an employment contract or appear on the payroll, and two members of the trade union's executive committee resigned from their trade union posts and withdrew their membership. In accordance with the inspection's findings, the Directorate for Trade Union Associations issued an order on  March  in which it stated that, as it had noted that the Trade Union of Workers of Extra Supermarkets did not have the minimum number of members required by law ( members, according to section  of the Labour Code) and that two of the posts on its executive committee were vacant, it gave the members  days in which to comply with the requirements of the law.
.The Government reports that the trade union held a general assembly on  March of this year with the aim of discussing reforms to the union's by-laws, the approval of new members and of elections to fill vacant posts. This notwithstanding, on  March  the Directorate for Trade Union Associations issued an order in which it denied registration of the new executive committee because it did not meet the requirements established by the Labour Code and the Regulations on Trade Union Associations. Later, on  April , the Director for Trade Union Associations received an official communication from the deputy labour judge, in which the judge ordered her to discontinue treatment of this case, as the decision as to whether the dissolution of the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets was thereafter to be dealt with by the court. The judgement was handed down on  April .
.The judgement of  April , which the Government encloses, specifically mentions the following:That ... this authority (the judge) personally inspected the records of the Directorate for Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour, and found that the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets did not meet the requirements of the Labour Code and the Regulations on Trade Union Associations, that the trade union did not comply with the orders of the Directorate for Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour to fill vacancies on its executive committee, and that the majority of its members, including its general secretary, its secretary of finance and its secretary of women's affairs had resigned, leaving the union leaderless and without members.That the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets had introduced a reform to its by-laws to convert it to an enterprise trade union, but that people who did not work at the enterprise were accepted as workers during this special meeting, thus meaning that the union did not have the majority required under section  of the Labour Code.Based on these considerations, and the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, this judge can only order the dissolution of the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets, as it has not met the requirements of the law ...
.The Committee observes that the complainant organizations in this case allege the dismissal of two trade union leaders from the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets (Mr. Carlos Espinoza and Mrs. Estrella Baca); threats against the job security of members who remain in the union; and the introduction of a legal request to dissolve the union, which was submitted by the manager of the Extra Supermarkets company.
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government, which states that the union was dissolved by a court as it no longer had the legally required minimum number of members (), the majority of the members of its executive committee had resigned and it was unable to correct this situation at a special assembly subsequently held by it.
.In this respect, the Committee must highlight that the Government: () has not sent observations on the allegations that the union's members have had their jobs threatened; () confirms that six members of the union (including Carlos Espinoza) were dismissed, but does not indicate the reasons for their dismissal, although it does specify that it ordered the reinstatement of another trade union leader (Estrella Baca); () does not indicate the reasons for which various members of the executive committee withdrew from the trade union. The Committee also notes that it was not asked by the complainant organization to examine whether or not the minimum number of  workers to establish an enterprise union was excessive.
.In these circumstances, the Committee cannot but conclude that the reduction in the number of union members to below the legal minimum of  is the consequence of anti-trade union dismissals or threats. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation of the real reasons for the dismissals of trade union leaders and members of the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets and of the reasons for the withdrawal of various trade union leaders from their membership in the union, and, should it be concluded that these were anti-trade union dismissals and that the withdrawal from union membership of trade union leaders resulted from pressure or threats from the employer, to impose the penalties provided by the legislation, to reinstate the dismissed workers in their jobs and permit the dissolved trade union to be reconstituted. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.
.In general, the Committee refers to the fundamental principle that ""no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities"", and to ""the importance of forbidding and penalizing in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment"" (see th Report, Case No.  (Uruguay), para. , and nd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to conduct an investigation of the real reasons for the dismissals of trade union leaders and members of the Trade Union of Workers of ""El Redentor"" Extra Supermarkets, and of the reasons for the withdrawal of various trade union leaders from their membership in the union.(b) If this investigation concludes that these were anti-trade union dismissals, the Committee requests the Government to impose the penalties provided by the legislation, to reinstate the dismissed workers in their jobs and to permit the trade union (which was dissolved for not having the legal minimum number of members) to be reconstituted.(c) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.",0,1994,Nicaragua
68,".The Committee last examined this case, which concerns dismissals in the customs sector following a strike in May , at its March  meeting (see th Report, paras. -). The Committee recalls that on that occasion, fully aware of the difficulty of reinstating the workers who were dismissed almost six years ago, it urged the Government to take all the necessary measures to ensure that the parties to the dispute reach an agreement on full compensation for the workers dismissed, if reinstatement was not possible.
.In a communication dated  August , the Government points out that the services of the General Directorate of Labour Relations and the Directorate of Conciliation and Collective Bargaining are available to help workers to resolve the dispute.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee again requests the Government to try to ensure that the parties concerned reach an agreement -- possibly with the assistance of these administrative bodies -- on full compensation for the workers dismissed, if reinstatement is not possible.
.The Committee last examined this case, which concerns dismissals in the customs sector following a strike in May , during its November  meeting (see th Report, paras.  to ). On this occasion, the Committee recalled that it had appealed to the Government, with a view to encouraging a return to harmonious industrial relations, to endeavour to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the UNE union leaders and members dismissed in the customs sector (see th Report, paras.  to ).
.In communications dated  January,  February and  May , the National Union of Employees (UNE) complained that the Government did not comply with the recommendations formulated by the Committee in June  and did not reinstate or compensate the workers dismissed in the customs sector. The complainant insisted on the fact that the workers dismissed following the strike amounted to , and amongst them were all the trade union leaders of the unions William Ruiz Martinez, Hroes y Mrtires del Sur, Pablo Lpez, Advana El Espino as well as the FETRAP Federation.
.In communications dated  October  and  January , the Government states that harmonious industrial relations do exist in the customs sector and indicates that a collective agreement has been reached between the General Directorate of Customs and the Union of Customs Workers, a copy of which is attached.
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Committee regrets that despite the time elapsed since its recommendations (June ), the parties concerned have not been able to reach an agreement on the reinstatement of the workers dismissed following the strike of . The Committee is fully aware of the difficulties with respect to the reinstatement of workers who were dismissed nearly six years ago and therefore urges the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure that the parties concerned do reach an agreement on full compensation for the workers dismissed, in the case that reinstatement could prove impossible.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting (see th Report, paras. -), at which it appealed to the Government, with a view to encouraging a return to harmonious industrial relations, to endeavour to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the UNE union leaders and members dismissed in the customs sector. In addition, with regard to the judicial appeals lodged by the workers dismissed from the San Pablo plantation and Amerrisque abattoir and the expulsion of the Secretary-General of ANDEN from the National Council of Education, the Committee firmly expected that the judicial authorities would hand down their decision as soon as possible.
.In a communication of May , the National Union of Employees (UNE) states that the Government neither recognizes nor is willing to accept the Committee's recommendation concerning the reinstatement in their jobs of the trade union leaders and members of the UNE dismissed in the customs sector.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government states in this respect that, according to the record of the administrative proceedings in the Ministry of Labour, the customs workers launched a strike in  because the trade union leaders refused to negotiate with the General Directorate of Customs on the list of demands under the collective agreement and that the trade union leadership should assume its responsibility to its members, especially when the employer's side was willing to bargain. All of this was noted during an inspection at the scene, with the result that the employer consented to resume bargaining and the workers called off the strike. The workers (the trade union) were informed of this but did not respond. The General Labour Inspectorate subsequently decided, at the employer's request, to declare the strike illegal for failing to comply with the provisions of section  of the Labour Code. An appeal was lodged against this decision with the General Director of Labour, who, after reviewing the record, upheld the decision handed down by the General Labour Inspector, and as a consequence an official communication was issued to the executive authorities requesting them to safeguard the public order, since violent acts disrupting the public order and violations of the Penal Code had been committed. The administration of the General Directorate of Customs then requested the Departmental Labour Inspectorate to authorize it to dismiss ten trade union leaders in the customs sector for purloining documents and tampering with their contents, signatures and stamps. The proceedings were duly carried out and it was ascertained in addition that six of the ten trade union leaders no longer had legal capacity, as it had expired, so that the request for authorization to dismiss nine of the ten workers was granted. It should be pointed out that the violations of labour law committed by these trade union leaders were as follows: lack of integrity and immoral conduct at work, which was also confirmed on the grounds that had been verified and noted by the Ministry of Labour (absence of legal capacity). By Decision No.  dated  June  (a duly certified copy of which was attached), the Supreme Court of Justice turned down the appeal for amparo (protection under constitutional provisions) lodged by the trade union leaders in the customs sector, finding that the Constitution recognizes the right to strike on the understanding that it is regulated by section  and other provisions of the Labour Code. However, a specific procedure has been laid down for the exercise of the right to strike, which must take place in conformity with the law. The Government adds that acts had been committed giving rise to unusual situations, for example the electricity had been cut off, home-made bombs had been set off, the circuit breakers of the lighting system had been sabotaged, customs officials' vehicles damaged and physical attacks had been perpetrated. The dangerous acts and abuses committed during the customs workers' strike were against the interests of society and the Government itself, and despite this harmonious labour relations had been restored with most of the workers, facilitating their return to work. The evidence which prompted the Ministry of Labour to authorize the dismissal of the trade union leaders, i.e. nine out of ten of the dismissals requested by the employer, was entirely clear. There had been no serious risk of abuse or serious prejudice to freedom of association, since no mass dismissals had taken place, the only requests for termination of the contract of employment by the employer on record being those mentioned above. Harmonious labour relations prevailed in the country's customs sector, since the strike was not really motivated by social demands and it was made clear that the trade union organization had been recognized by the representatives of the General Directorate of Customs. Negotiations of the collective agreement were currently under way and the Secretary-General of the trade union had stated that there was labour stability and good employer/employee relations.
.In addition, in a communication of  October , the Government states that: () regarding the pending legal proceedings relating to the dismissals at the San Pablo plantation, the workers' legal adviser presenting the case indicated that the matter has been abandoned since those involved decided to work in Costa Rica and discontinued the proceedings; and () regarding the legal proceedings concerning the dismissal of the workers at the Amerrisque abattoir, in conformity with the judicial decision, the employer made a settlement payment to  workers, who expressly renounced all rights to take further legal action. As a result, the employer cancelled the salary and gave them their compensatory payment.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government regarding the dismissal of the trade union leaders and members of the UNE, in particular its statement to the effect that there are now harmonious industrial relations in the customs sector. The Committee observes that a total of nine dismissals took place and considers that since they date back to , reinstatement does not appear to be feasible. As regards the judicial appeals lodged by the workers dismissed from the San Pablo plantation and Amerrisque abattoir, the",1,1993,Nicaragua
69,"Committee notes the information submitted by the Government. Finally, regarding the legal proceeding with respect to the expulsion of the Secretary-General of ANDEN from the National Council of Education, as the Government has not communicated any information concerning the outcome of the proceedings, the Committee firmly expects that the judicial authorities will hand down their decision as soon as possible.
.The Committee examined this case at its June  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )), at which it reached interim conclusions. Subsequently, the National Employees' Union (UNE) submitted further allegations and additional information in communications dated  May and  July .
.The Government sent partial observations in communications dated  September and  October  and  January and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, which dealt with alleged acts of violence against trade union leaders and members, the Committee requested the Government to communicate as soon as possible its observations on the following allegations that were still pending: the alleged death threats against unionized workers at the La Candelaria plantation and against Mr. Isaas Jimnez and other trade union officials at the La Florida ranch; the harassment and repression of trade union officials Pedro Turcios, Efrn Snchez and Juan Vsquez of the National Development Bank, as well as the police persecution of the last-named official; and the violent eviction of  workers at the Penwalt enterprise who had gone on a hunger strike in front of the headquarters of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (see th Report, paras.  and (b)).
.The Committee also examined allegations with respect to anti-union dismissals and made the following recommendations (see th Report, para. (c) and (d)):The Committee requests the Government to inform it as to the results of the appeals filed by dismissed workers at the San Pablo plantation and the Amerrisque abattoir. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the decision handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the expulsion of the general secretary of the National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN) from the National Educational Council.The Committee also requests the Government to point out the specific reasons for the dismissals at the Alfonso Angelina plantation ( union members), the El Paraso ranch (the Secretary-General of the Union, Mr. Trnsito Torres Prez) and the La Florida ranch (nine union members), so that it can issue an opinion in this respect.
.Finally, the Committee invited the complainant organizations to provide specific information concerning the alleged dismissal of workers affiliated to the National Union of Employees, since the Government stated that it could not reply if it did not have more details (names, work site, position) (see th Report, paras.  and (g)).
.With respect to the Committee's request that the National Union of Employees (UNE) provide additional information on the alleged anti-union dismissal of union leaders and members in the public administration, the UNE states in its communication of  May  that  union leaders and members working in various customs offices in the country were dismissed following the Ministry of Labour's declaration on  May  that their strike was illegal. The organization adds that the  union leaders and members dismissed include the entire executive body of the National Federation of Customs Workers, and that they were not dismissed for restructuring but as a reprisal for having led and participated in a strike in the customs sector. The complainant organization also states that the National Federation of Customs Workers lodged an appeal with the Appeals Court, and that the General Directorate of Customs reinstated other workers () who had been dismissed but not the union leaders and members.
.Finally, in its communication of  June  the UNE states that the court rejected the appeal lodged by the National Federation of Customs Workers on the grounds that workers in the public administration are not entitled to use strike action in support of union demands.
.In its communication of  September  concerning the UNE's allegations, the Government states that they concern a strike in essential services which is clearly prohibited under section  of the Labour Code and that the same section provides for compensatory measures such as submitting disputes between the parties to the labour courts for decision. The Government adds that, by refusing to comply with the Managua Appeals Court's decision that they resume negotiations or join the conciliation board, they failed to follow this procedure and instead went on strike.
.In its communication of  October  concerning the allegations that were still pending in June , the Government states that:- with regard to the alleged threats against Mr. Isaas Jimnez and other workers at the La Florida ranch, according to the workers' own statements to the police the threats came from the rebels (the Government encloses a statement to the police by the administrator of the ranch). The Government adds that the death threats did not come from the employer but from persons outside the ranch;- with regard to the harassment and repression of workers of the National Development Bank and the police persecution of a union official, and the violent ejection of strikers from the Penwalt enterprise, the Ministry of Labour has asked the Ministry of the Interior for information;- with regard to the alleged dismissals at the Alfonso Angelina and La Florida ranches, no administrative appeal has been filed. In the case of the El Paraso ranch, Mr. Mr. Trnsito Torres Prez decided to go and work in another ranch and, one year later, returned and asked for his permanent job back, which the owner of the ranch refused;- the courts have not yet handed down their judgement on the appeals filed by the dismissed workers of the Amerrisque abattoir and the San Pablo plantation, or on the appeal lodged with the Supreme Court of Justice in connection with the expulsion of the secretary-general of ANDEN from the National Council of Education.
.In its communications of  January and  March  the Government states that: () the incidents at the origin of the alleged acts of violence in  have been completely resolved; () the relevant court judgements (Amerrisque abattoir, San Pablo plantation and ANDEN) have not yet been handed down; and () it reiterates the information it communicated previously regarding the dismissals at the Alfonso Angelina, El Paraso and La Florida ranches. Finally, the Government states that, since the allegations in this case date back several years, it is impossible for it to obtain further information on certain aspects of the original allegations.
.The Committee observes that the allegations that were still pending when it last examined the case referred to death threats and acts of violence against union leaders and members and to anti-union dismissals in various enterprises. The Committee further observes that the new allegations refer to anti-union dismissals in the public administration.
.Regarding the alleged death threats against Mr. Isaas Jimnez and other union leaders at the La Florida ranch, the Committee notes the Government's comment that the persons concerned stated to the police that the threats came from the rebels (the Government encloses a declaration to the police to this effect by the administrator of the ranch).
.Regarding the alleged acts of violence against union leaders and members (the harassment of trade union leaders Pedro Turcios, Efrn Snchez and Juan Vsquez of the National Development Bank, and the police persecution of the last-named of these leaders; and the violent expulsion by force of  workers from the Penwalt enterprise who had gone on hunger strike in front of the headquarters of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration), the Committee notes the Government's statement in  that it has requested information from the Ministry of the Interior. The Committee further notes that the Government has not sent any observations on the alleged death threats made against workers affiliated to the La Candelaria plantation trade union.
.Noting that the Government also states that, because most of the allegations date back to , it is impossible for it to obtain further information to respond to certain aspects of the original allegations and that the incidents that were at the origin of the complaint have been resolved, the Committee emphasizes that it cannot accept these arguments and regrets that, in spite of the time that has passed and its various requests for information, the Government has either sent incomplete information or has made no observation at all. That being so, the Committee emphasizes that ""freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed"" and that, ""in the event of assaults on the physical or moral integrity of individuals, the Committee has considered that an independent",0,1993,Nicaragua
70,"judicial inquiry should be instituted immediately with a view to fully clarifying the facts, determining responsibility, punishing those responsible and preventing the repetition of such acts"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , paras.  and ). Bearing in mind the aforementioned principles, therefore, the Committee calls on the Government to arrange for judicial inquiries to be instituted immediately into the alleged acts of violence.
.Regarding the alleged dismissals in the Alfonso Angelina plantation ( union members), the El Paraso ranch (the Secretary-General of the Union, Mr. Trnsito Torres Prez) and the La Florida ranch (nine union members), the Committee notes the Government's statement that no administrative appeals against dismissal have been filed at the Alfonso Angelina and La Florida ranches, and that in the case of the El Paraso ranch Mr. Trnsito Torres Prez decided to go and work in another ranch and returned one year later asking for his permanent job back, which the owner of the ranch refused.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not investigated whether the alleged incidents were due to the trade union office or activities of the persons concerned. That being so, the Committee calls on the Government to arrange for an inquiry to be held at the Alfonso Angelina and La Florida ranches and, should the allegations prove true, for compensation to be provided for any acts of discrimination that may have been committed and that the persons concerned be reinstated in their jobs.
.Regarding the alleged anti-union dismissal of  union leaders and members affiliated to the UNE following a strike that had been declared illegal by the administrative authorities, the Committee notes that according to the Government: (i) the strike took place in essential services, which is clearly prohibited by section  of the Labour Code; (ii) the same section of the Labour Code provides for compensatory measures such as submitting disputes between the parties to the labour tribunals for resolution; and (iii) by refusing to comply with the Managua Appeals Court's decision that they resume negotiations or join the conciliation board, the complainants failed to make use of this compensatory measure and went on strike instead.
.The Committee wishes to recall that ""recognition of the principle of freedom of association in the case of public servants does not necessarily imply the right to strike"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ) and that it has stated on many occasions that the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in the public service in the case of officials who exercise authority in the name of the State. Noting that in the present case almost all the union leaders and members who took part in the strike were employed in various customs offices in the country - and can therefore be looked upon as public servants exercising authority in the name of the State - the Committee considers that the ban on workers in this sector taking part in a strike is not contrary to the principles of freedom of association, especially bearing in mind that the workers concerned benefit from compensatory guarantees, for example in the form of participation in negotiations on a conciliation board.
.However, the Committee wishes to remind the Government that ""dismissals of strikers on a large scale involve a serious risk of abuse and places freedom of association in grave jeopardy"" and that ""the competent authorities should be given appropriate instructions so as to obviate the dangers to freedom of association that such dismissals involve"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). That being so, the Committee calls on the Government, with a view to encouraging a return to harmonious industrial relations, to endeavour to facilitate the reinstatement in their jobs of the UNE leaders and members dismissed in the customs sector. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.
.Finally, the Committee regrets the extremely long delay - some of the judicial proceedings date back to  - in the judicial authorities' ruling on the appeals lodged by the workers dismissed from the San Pablo plantation and Amerrisque abattoir and on the expulsion of the secretary-general of ANDEN from the National Council of Education and reminds it that ""cases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.  should be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really effective; an excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and in particular a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union leaders, constitute a denial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons concerned"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). In these conditions, the Committee firmly expects that the judicial authorities will hand down their decision as soon as possible and requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings in question.
.The complaint in this case is contained in a joint communication from the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) and the Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC) dated  June . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  June , the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) and the Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC), in addition to criticizing the structural adjustment programme introduced in , also point out that the Government's attitude towards workers has been to engage systematically in police repression, the arrest of trade union officials, physical aggression, and the dismissal of trade union officials, while creating a widespread climate of violence.
.Specifically, the complainants allege the following violations of trade union rights:- La Candelaria banana plantation (western part of the country): dismissal of  workers for having formed a trade union; a court ruling has ordered all dismissed workers reinstated, though this has not been carried out. The Government ordered the arrest of trade union officials, accusing them of the crime of unlawful association for criminal purposes, and has made death threats to workers.- San Pablo banana plantation (western part of the country): dismissal of seven members of the trade union executive committee and  workers; four trade union officials were arrested and trade union members were offered bribes to desist from their trade union activities.- El Relampago banana plantation (western part of country): dismissal of  trade union members.- Alfonso Angelina banana plantation (western part of country): dismissal of  trade unionists, including Mrs. Mercedes Valladares Neyra of the Trade Union's Women's Secretariat.- El Paraiso ranch (northern part of country): dismissal of Mr. Trnsito Torres Prez, General Secretary of the trade union.- La Florida ranch (northern part of country): dismissal of nine trade unionists; Mr. Mercedey Salmern Arceda, a trade unionist, was murdered; and death threats were made against Mr. Isaas Jimnez and other trade union officials.- La Suiza ranch (northern part of country): violent eviction of three trade unionists.- Murder of the trade union official of the Agricultural Workers' Association, Mr. Flix Humberto Chavarra Olivas, on  January .- Military repression of customs workers: during a strike by customs workers, customs buildings were occupied by the police and army; after this forcible act was declared illegal,  trade union officials were arrested. The complainants also allege that attempts have been made to bribe workers to return to their work, and that strike breakers have been hired. On  May  the police and army ejected strikers from the customs buildings at Penas Blancas and Guasaule, beating  workers and firing at trade union officials. On  June  the police fired at strikers at the Penas Blancas customshouse, wounding three workers.- National Development Bank (BANADES): dismissal of  workers in the BANADES National Workers' Union (the dismissals took place in Managua and at branch offices in Siuna, Puerto Cabezas, Bluefields, San Carlos and San Miguelito). A campaign of harassment and repression is being waged against the three main officials of the trade union (Mr. Juan Vsquez, Mr. Pedro Turcios and Mr. Efrn Snchez), with police persecution of Mr. Juan Vsquez.- Public administration: a drastic budget cut has been ordered; consequently, social security contributions specified in collective bargaining agreements have been frozen and workers, mainly those affiliated with the National Employees' Union have been dismissed.- National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN): Mr. Quintana, ANDEN General Secretary , was expelled from the National Council of Education; trade union officials and members of ANDEN were dismissed (a total of , whose names are given by the complainants).- San Antonio sugar mill (western part of country): after a strike was called, on  March  the army and police attacked strikers, injuring the following workers: Sergio Silva Gonzales, Francisco Balmaceda, Cruz Medina, Milton Lezama, and Mario Guzmn; Mr. Francisco Picado Meza was killed when the sugar cane field in which he was hiding was set on fire by shots fired from an army helicopter.-",1,1993,Nicaragua
71,"Amerrisque abattoir (Juigalpa area): dismissal of  workers belonging to the trade union, including every member of the executive committee; with consent of the Minister of Labour, a court decree ordering the reinstatement of the dismissed workers was ignored.- Enterprises in the industrial free zone (north-east of Managua), such as Fortex, Velcas Internacional, Neptuno and others: impossibility of signing collective agreements and forming trade unions.- Penwalt enterprise: as a protest against the serious contamination suffered by workers who handle chemicals,  workers went on a hunger strike in front of the headquarters of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. On  May , the strikers were violently ejected by the police.
.In its communications of  and  February , the Government makes the following observations on the allegations presented by the complainants:- La Candelaria plantation: in May , the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of the city of Chinandega received  letters of dismissal involving the same number of workers, sent by the employer, the La Candelaria plantation, citing as just cause the provisions of article , paragraphs  and  of the Labour Code. After a number of administrative and legal proceedings, the Court of Appeals for the Second Region, Civil and Labour Division, decided to modify the provisions and ordered the reinstatement of the trade union executive committee, as well as payment of their social security contributions; as for the remaining workers, in addition to the payment of their social security contributions, it ordered payment of the compensation provided for in the collective agreement. As things currently stand, the decision is being implemented. The Government also states that investigations undertaken by the Civil Inspectorate for Occupational Affairs determined that on  April , workers seized the La Candelaria plantation, committing acts of violence and damaging property. Consequently, charges were filed at the First District Criminal Court of the city of Chinandega for the crime of property damage, illegal association for criminal purposes, jeopardizing personal safety, and aggravated robbery of personal property against Felipe Osejo, Medardo Ros, Emiliano Hernndez, Claudio Blandino, Pablo Castillo, Antonio Hernndez, Ramn Solano Silva, Abraham Cerda, Julio Rocha and Angela Zniga. Evidence of these facts has been presented to the court, which has not yet handed down a verdict.- San Pablo plantation: the employer did carry out massive dismissals on  August , which included members of the trade union executive committee. However, these persons reported to the Departmental Inspectorate of Labour of the city of Chinandega that they had been dismissed on  October , and requested that all members of the executive committee of the Ignacio Garcia Vargas trade union as well as all workers who were dismissed, be reinstated. Following various proceedings involving the Labour Inspectorate, the case is presently under appeal.- El Relampago plantation: the claim is based on the dismissal of  workers belonging to the trade union in July . The Second District Court of Civil and Labour Affairs of the city of Chinandega has ordered that  workers be reinstated.- Alfonso Angelina plantation: The Chinandega Departmental Inspectorate denied the request by Mrs. Valladares Neyra, finding it without ground since witnesses testified that she was a temporary worker.- El Paraiso ranch: although the Government points out that a reply was given to this allegation in connection with Case No. , the allegations in this case are new.- La Florida ranch: as regards the dismissals, no claim has been submitted to the regional office of the Ministry of Labour. As regards the death of Mr. Salmern Arceda, the national police inquiry, as well as statements from workers at the ranch, make it clear that he was murdered as a result of a personal quarrel with a former retired worker which eventually resulted in the use of firearms. This matter has absolutely nothing to do with labour or trade union affairs, as it was simply a common crime.- La Suiza ranch: the eviction alleged by the complainants resulted from a claim for return of property filed by Mrs. Concepcin Morales de Correa at the district civil court against Esthela Rodrguez, Antonieta Martnez Zamora, Josefa Prez Garca, Reyna Barrera Garca and Bertha Castro. The court granted the request for returning the property, ordering the occupants to return it to its owner, Mrs. Morales. This case concerns problems of land ownership and has absolutely nothing to do with labour or trade union affairs.- Murder of trade union official Mr. Felix Humberto Chavarra Olivas: court authorities in Matagalpa have stated that his murder was a common crime stemming from personal problems between businessmen, and that investigations showed no evidence whatsoever that the motives were related to labour or trade union matters.- Military repression of customs workers affiliated to the trade union: the customs workers strike was declared illegal for having failed to comply with provisions of sections , , and  of the Labour Code. Strikers committed a series of criminal acts in that they used violence and firearms to seize the customs buildings, blocking free access by their colleagues who were not in agreement with the strike and wanted to exercise their legitimate right to work, and attacked border customshouses, seriously wounding two policemen and one customs worker. In their zeal to pit workers against customs authorities and accentuate their differences, they forged documents, producing a list of dismissals supposedly signed by the Assistant to the General Director of Customs and with the seal of the Ministry of Finance, with the above signature and seal superimposed, a deed classified as a crime by our civil and penal legislation.- Massive dismissals at the National Development Bank: no complaints concerning massive dismissals at the National Development Bank (BANADES) were lodged with the Ministry of Labour or the courts. Bank authorities state that on the date referred to by the complainants, BANADES offered its personnel a staff reduction plan due to overstaffing. The plan was completely voluntary and offered an average compensation that was  per cent greater than the entitlement under law. Thus expectant mothers were paid for the remaining time of their pregnancy and maternity leave; workers with the most seniority were given two months' pay for every five years of service, in addition to the above compensation. Trade union officials attempted to oppose the reduction plan, but the members would not allow it as  voluntary requests had been made despite the fact that BANADES was only asking for .- Public administration: the Government denies that social security contributions provided for in collective agreements were frozen, pointing out that not only were collective agreements in force on the date of the complaint complied with, but that new agreements have been signed since that time. In accordance with records of the Office of Conciliation of the Ministry of Labour,  collective agreements were signed in , of which  ( per cent) were in the private sector and  ( per cent) in the public sector. The trade union confederations that played major roles in negotiating collective agreements were the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CTC), the Nicaraguan Workers' Confederation (CTN), the Nicaraguan Independent Workers' Confederation (CTNA), the Unified Trade Union Confederation (CUS), two unions without a confederation, plus various confederations that participated as a group. The CST was party to the greatest number of agreements signed. In addition, as regards allegations concerning the dismissal of other civil servants, including members of trade unions affiliated with the National Employees' Union, the complainants provide no names, worksites or positions; the Government is therefore unable to communicate its observations.- National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN): (a) expulsion of the ANDEN General Secretary, Mr. Mario Quintana, from the National Education Council, pursuant to a ministerial resolution from the Ministry of Education: ANDEN has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice, which has not yet ruled on the case; and (b) the arbitrary, unilateral dismissal of the leading ANDEN activists, who were working as teachers and educators: The Government states that two of them were not dismissed and continue to carry out their duties; two have been reinstated; one was dismissed as part of a restructuring plan; two agreed to a retraining plan; two were transferred under restructuring, which they did not accept but have made no appeal to the courts; three were dismissed for having been accomplices to the persons who seized an education office; two were dismissed for having seized the office and kidnapped its chief; one was dismissed for the crime of slander; two who were political appointees were dismissed; and one has died. As regards the following workers, the Government states that the courts have either denied their claims or not yet ruled on them, or else they have been guilty of unethical conduct: Francisco Gonzlez, Jorge Aguilar Aguilera, Martha Altamirano Vega, Jazmina Novoa Ruz, Ana Julia Castillo, Laura Bermudez Robleto, Nury Vanegas, Jaime Castilla Vlchez, Marina Liliana Duarte Cruz, Aminta Morales Videa, Ruth Espinoza Ordez, Melba Luz Aguilera, Martha Tefila Valladares Martnez, Isaura Chavarra Salgado, Brenda Lpez Caldern, Mirna",1,1993,Nicaragua
72,"Blandn Gadea, Martha Rivera Blandn, Socorro Palacios Castro, Ren Hernndez Valle, Denis Martnez Ruz and Claudia Castillo Lechado. The Government also points out that it has not yet received information concerning the two teachers, Mrs. Felicitas Corrales and Mrs. Ana Mara Zavala.
.As regards the allegations concerning the San Antonio sugar mill, the Government states that the events of  March  constituted an illegal strike accompanied by acts of violence by a group of workers at the San Antonio sugar mill, and that strikers attacked the national police, wounding one policeman and the striker Sergio David Silva Gonzlez. A group of approximately  strikers subsequently assembled in front of the hospital in order to hinder the treatment of the wounded policeman while confronting the police. Owing to this action,  persons were arrested, of whom  were eventually released. As the final outcome to the events, the burned body of Francisco Picado was found in the ditch set on fire by the strikers; the cause of death has not yet been determined. Among the injured were Sergio Silva, a trade unionist, and two other unidentified persons. The remaining  arrested persons were brought before the First District Criminal Court where they presented a declaration. The national police are considered to have acted in accordance with provisions of section  of the Act concerning national police duties as regards legal assistance. Following negotiations, the  trade unionists were released and resumed their normal duties at the San Antonio sugar mill, bringing this incident to a close.
.As regards the alleged dismissals at the Amerrisque abattoir, the Government points out that on  June  management of the abattoir requested that the strike called by officials of the Luis Felipe Acosta trade union be declared illegal. The labour inspector visited the Amerrisque abattoir to investigate the strike; he noted that it had begun on  June  for the purpose of obtaining the reinstatement of three dismissed workers, and to obtain titles of ownership and wage increases of up to  per cent, and that it was an indefinite strike, meant to last until management of the abattoir accepted the workers' demands.
.Having determined that  of the  signatures affixed to the list of demands were false, that six signatures pertained to workers who had retired, five pertained to former workers at the abattoir, and that the number of workers at the enterprise totalled , of whom  were permanent and  temporary, the General Labour Inspectorate issued a resolution declaring the strike called by the Luis Felipe Acosta trade union illegal, considering that the demands were submitted one day after a group of workers had decided to call a strike, in violation of the provisions of sections  and following of the Labour Code. This resolution authorized the enterprise to apply section ,  and  of the Labour Code, which state that in the event of an illegal strike, employment contracts signed with strikers shall be terminated at no liability to the employer, who shall be exempt from penalties of any nature which may be levied on strikers for their infringements of the law; that whenever a strike is declared illegal, police authorities shall be ordered to use any means at their disposal to ensure that work will continue; and that if the matter concerns public services in private hands, the Executive Branch may assume control for this same purpose. The law also provides that even though the strike may lead to an agreement between parties, any person who may have committed crimes or misdeeds in connection with the strike may be held liable for such acts. Based on this resolution, on  June  authorities at the Amerrisque abattoir provided the Departmental Labour Inspectorate of Chontales with a list of persons whose employment contract had been terminated as a result of the strike having been declared illegal.
.On  June  the trade union filed an appeal of the resolution with the General Labour Inspectorate; the appellant party was informed that it should submit a list of its grievances to the General Labour Office within  hours. This Office subsequently upheld the resolution by the General Labour Inspectorate in toto, considering that both management and the trade union at the Amerrisque abattoir had signed a collective agreement on  May ; in other words, although less than a month had passed since the signing of the agreement, which was valid for one year, the trade union had called a strike; moreover,  of the  signatures affixed to the list of demands had been falsified; the provisions of sections  and following of the Labour Code had been violated; and the General Inspectorate had acted in accordance with the law. Trade union officials then filed an appeal with the th Regional Court of Appeals, which has not yet rendered its decision.
.As regards the allegations relative to the free zone and the above-mentioned enterprises, the Government has provided information that does not specifically respond to the allegations.
.Lastly, as regards the allegation concerning the Penwalt enterprise, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour was not a party in this case, owing to the fact that from the beginning the complainant workers resorted to the judiciary by filing a claim with the Second Labour Court. In a decision of  March , this Court ruled that the claims filed by the  workers at the enterprise were without ground. These workers then appealed before the same authority in order to have the case reviewed by the rd Regional Court of Appeals in Managua, which has not yet rendered its decision.
.The Committee notes that the allegations concern the murder, arrest and other acts of violence against trade union officials and unionists, anti-trade union dismissals and other infringements of trade union rights at various enterprises.
.As regards the allegations concerning the murder of trade union officials, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that an investigation concluded that Mr. Mercedey Salmern Arceda (La Florida ranch) was murdered by a former worker at the ranch as a result of a personal quarrel, and that a judiciary investigation found that Mr. Felix Humberto Chavarra Olivas (ATC trade union official) was murdered as a result of personal problems among businessmen. In these circumstances, noting that the Government views these events as unrelated to trade union matters and that the complainants have not provided details as regards the anti-trade union nature of these events, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee takes note of the observations submitted by the Government concerning the allegations relative to acts of violence, to wit:- As regards the violent eviction of three trade unionists at the La Suiza ranch, the Committee takes note that the workers were evicted as the result of a legal claim for return of property filed by the owner of the ranch, which was granted, and that this case is therefore completely unrelated to labour or trade union affairs.- As regards the alleged orders to arrest two trade union officials at the La Candelaria plantation, the Committee takes note that the workers employed violence in damaging property and occupied the plantation on  April , and that the owners of the plantation have filed a claim in criminal court against ten workers, charging them with the crime of property damage, illegal association for criminal purposes, jeopardizing personal safety and robbery, and that the judgement is still pending.
.In these circumstances, noting that the Government views these alleged events as unrelated to trade union issues or as abuses of trade union rights, the Committee trusts that the judicial investigations will conclude quickly and that the guilty parties will be punished.
.As regards the allegations concerning the events which took place at the Customshouses, following the declaration of the strike as illegal (physical aggression against  customs workers, leading to the injury of three trade unionists at the Penas Blancas customshouse and the arrest of  customs trade union officials), the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the strike had been declared illegal for failure to comply with provisions of the Labour Code, and that strikers committed a series of crimes (attacking border stations with firearms, resulting in the wounding of two policemen and one customs worker; using violence to occupy customs facilities; blocking the access of workers who wanted to go to work). It also takes note that documents were forged in order to pit workers against customs authorities, namely a list of dismissed workers bearing the forged signature of the assistant to the General Director of Customs. In addition, concerning acts of violence committed at the San Antonio sugar mill, and as a consequence of a confrontation between strikers, the police and army (leading to the murder of Mr. Francisco Picado Meza, and injuries to Mr. Sergio Silva Gonzales, Mr. Francisco Balmaceda, Mr. Cruz Medina, Mr. Milton Lezama and Mr. Mario Guzmn), the Committee notes that such acts of violence were",1,1993,Nicaragua
73,"due to the fact that striking workers at the enterprise attacked the police, and that as a consequence of these confrontations four workers and one policeman were injured, while the reasons for the death of Mr. Francisco Picado Meza have not been determined. As regards these allegations, the Committee observes that strikers resorted to violence, committing criminal acts. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that the principles of trade union freedom do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has not communicated its observations concerning the following allegations: the death threats against workers in the trade union at the La Candelaria ranch, and against Mr. Isaas Jimnez and other trade union officials at the La Florida ranch; the harassment and repression of trade union officials Mr. Pedro Turcios, Efrn Snchez and Juan Vsquez at the National Development Bank, as well as police persecution of Mr. Vsquez; and the violent eviction of  workers at the Penwalt enterprise who had gone on a hunger strike at the Central American Bank For Economic Integration (the Government has sent observations concerning the grounds for their claims, but not as regards the violent eviction). The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these matters as soon as possible. Generally speaking, as regards all these allegations of murder, death threats, physical aggression, police persecution and arrest of trade union officials and unionists, the Committee deeply deplores the numerous acts of violence, and expresses its concern while observing that they have been directed against a large number of trade union officials and unionists. It draws the Government's attention to the fact that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, , rd edition, para. ).
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers for having formed a trade union at the La Candelaria banana plantation, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the Court of Appeals has ordered the reinstatement of the trade union executive committee and payment of their social security contributions, and for the remaining dismissed workers the payment of compensation as provided for in the collective agreement, as well as payment of social security contributions. In this sense, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the principle which states that when in practice national legislation allows employers to dismiss employees because of their membership in a trade union or because they engage in trade union activities, provided they pay compensation fixed by law in every case of arbitrary dismissal, there is inadequate protection against acts of anti-trade union discrimination as referred to in Convention No. . The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to modify the legislation which will ensure adequate protection against acts of anti-trade union discrimination.
.As regards the dismissal of some  unionized workers at the El Relampago plantation, the Committee takes note that the courts have ordered  of them to be reinstated.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers at the San Pablo banana plantation, including seven members of the trade union executive committee, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the dismissed workers had lodged an appeal against this administrative decision. The Committee once again observes that a very large number of trade union officials and members were dismissed and requests the Government to inform it as to the results of the appeal. The Committee recalls that an excessive delay in processing cases of anti-trade union discrimination is tantamount to a denial of due process.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of workers in the National Employees' Union, the Committee notes the Government's statement that it cannot communicate its observations in this respect unless the names are provided, as well as the worksites and positions occupied by the persons dismissed. The Committee invites the complainant organizations to provide specific information concerning these allegations.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers of the National Workers' Trade Union at the National Development Bank, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the bank offered its staff a totally voluntary staff reduction plan with generous compensation ( per cent higher than that provided for by law), and that  workers signed up for the plan even though only  could be accommodated, despite the trade union's opposition to the plan. The Committee, however, reiterates the importance of consulting trade union organizations concerning every staff reduction plan.
.As regards the allegation concerning which the Fortex, Velcas International, Neptuno and other enterprises in the industrial free zone in the north-east section of the city of Managua offer no opportunity to sign collective agreements and constitute trade unions, the Committee observes that the Government has not specifically replied to these allegations. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee the right of workers in the free zones to constitute organizations of their choosing and to engage freely in collective bargaining and to keep the Committee informed in this respect.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  trade union officials and trade unionists in the Trade Union of Teachers of the National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN), as a result of their trade union activities, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that two were not dismissed and continue to carry out their duties, two have been reinstated, one was dismissed as part of a restructuring plan, two agreed to a retraining plan, two were transferred owing to restructuring, to which they objected but have made no appeal to the courts, three were dismissed for having conspired with persons who seized an education office, two were dismissed for having seized the office and kidnapped its chief, one was dismissed for slander, two political appointees were dismissed, one has died, and information is still being sought for two others. The Committee requests the Government to inform it as to the specific reasons for the dismissal of the following workers, regarding whom the Government has merely stated that the courts have denied their claims or have not yet ruled on them, or else they have been guilty of unethical conduct: Francisco Gonzlez, Jorge Aguilar Aguilera, Martha Altamirano Vega, Jazmina Novoa Ruz, Ana Julia Castillo, Laura Bermdez Robleto, Nury Vanegas, Jaime Castilla Vlchez, Marina Liliana Duarte Cruz, Aminta Morales Videa, Ruth Espinoza Ordez, Melba Luz Aguilera, Martha Tefila Valladares Martnez, Isaura Chavarra Salgado, Brenda Lpez Caldern, Mirna Blandn Gadea, Martha Rivera Blandn, Socorro Palacios Castro, Ren Hernndez Valle, Denis Martnez Ruz and Claudia Castillo Lechado. The Committee also requests the Government to communicate its observations concerning workers to whom no reference has been made: Felicita Corrales, Ana Mara Zavala, Idalia Mendoza Sanarruza, Reynaldo Alvarez, Walter Cabrera, Luz Delia Carvajal, Norman Garca and Miriam Olivas Ardn. The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of all legal proceedings currently under way in this connection.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has not sent sufficient information concerning the following dismissals: () at the Alfonso Angelina plantation ( trade unionists); () at the El Paraiso ranch (general secretary of the Trnsito Torres Prez trade union); and () the La Florida ranch (nine trade unionists). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to provide the specific reasons for these dismissals so that it can issue an opinion in this respect.
.As regards the allegation that  unionized workers were dismissed at the Amerrisque abattoir, including every member of the executive committee, and that a court decision ordering the reinstatement of the dismissed workers was ignored, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that following an inquiry, the General Labour Inspectorate confirmed that  of the  signatures on the list of demands were false, that the total number of workers is , that the strike called by the trade union was consequently declared illegal, and that the enterprise was authorized to terminate the contracts signed with the strikers. The Committee also notes that this matter has been submitted to the Court of Appeals. The Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the massive dismissal of strikers poses a serious risk of abuse and undermines freedom of association. Competent authorities should be given appropriate instructions so as to obviate the dangers to freedom of association that such dismissals involve (see Digest, op. cit., para. ). The Committee regrets these massive dismissals for having taken part in a strike, and requests the Government to inform it of the decision reached by the Court of Appeals.
.Generally speaking, as regards the many alleged anti-trade union dismissals in various enterprises and in view of the fact that these dismissals affect a large number of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee reminds the Government that no one should be the target",1,1993,Nicaragua
74,"of anti-trade union discrimination for having engaged in legitimate trade union activities, and that ""protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should cover not only hiring and dismissal but also any discriminatory measures during employment, in particular transfers, downgrading and other acts that are prejudicial to the worker"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.As regards the allegation that the general secretary of the Trade Union of Teachers of the National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN) was expelled, the Committee notes that an appeal has been filed with the Supreme Court of Justice and that a decision has not yet been rendered. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed concerning the decision by the Supreme Court.
.Lastly, as regards the allegations of a freeze of social security contributions in public administration collective agreements, the Committee observes that the Government denies these allegations, stating that not only have the collective agreements been complied with, but also that  new agreements in the public sector were signed in .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Deeply deploring the acts of violence which occurred at the La Suiza ranch and the La Candelaria plantation, and drawing the Government's attention to the fact that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind, the Committee trusts that the judiciary investigations will conclude quickly and that the guilty parties will be punished.(b) The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations concerning the following allegations as soon as possible: the alleged death threats against unionized workers at the La Candelaria plantation and against Mr. Isaas Jimnez and the other trade union officials at the La Florida ranch; the harassment and repression of trade union officials Pedro Turcios, Efrn Snchez and Juan Vsquez of the National Development Bank, as well as the police persecution of the latter official; and the violent eviction of  workers at the Penwalt enterprise who had gone on a hunger strike at the headquarters of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration.(c) The Committee requests the Government to inform it as to the results of the appeals filed by dismissed workers at the San Pablo plantation and the Amerrisque abattoir. The Committee also requests the Government to inform it of the decision handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the expulsion of the General Secretary of the National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN) from the National Education Council.(d) The Committee requests the Government to point out the specific reasons for the dismissals at the Alfonso Angelina plantation, the El Paraiso ranch and the La Florida ranch, so that it can issue an opinion in this respect.(e) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to modify legislation which will ensure adequate protection against acts of anti-trade union discrimination.(f) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to guarantee the right of workers in the free zones to constitute organizations of their choosing and to engage freely in collective bargaining and to keep the Committee informed in this respect.(g) The Committee invites the complainant organizations to provide specific information concerning the alleged dismissals of workers affiliated with the National Employees' Union.",1,1993,Nicaragua
75,".In a communication sent to the Director-General of the International Labour Office on  December , the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) reported the assassination of Mr. Arges Sequeira, an employers' leader and the Vice-President of the COSEP (the High Council of Private Enterprise), and an attack against the COSEP headquarters, and requested that the ILO intervene with the Government of Nicaragua. In a communication of  December  the Director-General of the Office asked the Government to send its observations on these reports and to take all possible measures to identify those responsible for these acts and to halt the killings and other violations of freedom of association. The President of Nicaragua, Mrs. Violeta Chamorro, sent the Government's observations in a communication dated  December .
.The complaint in this case concerns matters related to those underlying the request for intervention and was submitted in a communication from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) dated  February . Subsequently, in a communication dated  May , this organization presented new allegations. The Government sent its observations in communications of  May and  August .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) alleges that the Vice-President of the High Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), Mr. Arges Sequeira (who was also President of the Agricultural Producers' Union of Nicaragua, UPANIC) was assassinated on  November , that the COSEP headquarters were bombed on  December  and that various attacks were carried out against Nicaraguan employers' organizations. The complainant states that preliminary inquiries indicate that those responsible for these acts are members of the Nicaraguan army. The complainant also mentions that COSEP members have received threats, including the organization's President, Mr. Ramiro Guardian, a substitute member of the ILO Governing Body, who has received death threats.
.In its communication of  May , the IOE states that the COSEP reported further death threats against Mr. Guardian, which had been denounced to the Minister of the Interior and the Government delegate, and that the threats had been made by members of the Punitive Leftist Front.
.In a communication dated  December , the President of Nicaragua, Mrs. Violeta Chamorro, condemns the killing of Mr. Sequeira and the attack against the offices of the High Council of Private Enterprise, and reports that inquiries are under way into these affairs.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that in December  instructions were given for the necessary measures to be taken to protect Mr. Ramiro Guardian's life, and that two teams of bodyguards were assigned to protect him and his residence.
.Subsequently, in a communication of  August , the Government states that judicial proceedings have begun against those responsible for the assassination of Mr. Sequeira (three former members of the military).
.The Committee observes that the allegations concern the assassination of the Vice-President of the High Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), Mr. Arges Sequeira, death threats made against the COSEP President, Mr. Ramiro Guardian, and the attack against the COSEP headquarters.
.As regards the assassination of Mr. Sequeira, the Committee regrets the return to a climate of violence and deeply deplores the murder of this leader of an employers' organization. It takes note of the information supplied by the Government that judicial proceedings are being taken against those responsible for this murder (three former members of the military). It expresses the firm hope that the judicial proceedings under way will enable the guilty parties to be identified and severely punished. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the trial and to send it the text of the ruling.
.As regards the death threats made against the COSEP President, Mr. Ramiro Guardian, the Committee observes that in December  the Government took the necessary measures to protect this employers' leader and his residence. The Committee requests the Government to continue providing such protection for as long as his life is in danger.
.As regards the bomb attack against the COSEP headquarters on  December , the Committee notes that an inquiry is under way. While regretting that this inquiry does not yet appear to have been completed, the Committee points out that a climate of violence such as one in which the premises and property of workers' and employers' organizations are attacked is a serious obstacle to the exercise of their rights, and that such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities. The Committee therefore asks the Government to step up the inquiry under way and to inform it of its outcome.
.Finally, the Committee expresses its concern regarding the acts of violence alleged in this case, and would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against these organizations' leaders and members, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Government will take all possible measures to ensure respect of this principle.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets the return to a climate of violence in Nicaragua and deeply deplores the murder of Mr. Sequeira, leader of an employers' organization. It notes that judicial proceedings have been initiated against those responsible (three former members of the military) for the death of Mr. Sequeira, and expresses its firm hope that these proceedings will enable the guilty parties to be identified and severely punished. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the trial and to send it a text of the ruling.(b) The Committee observes that in December  the Government took the necessary measures to protect the COSEP President, Mr. Ramiro Guardian, who had received death threats, and his residence. The Committee requests the Government to continue to provide such protection to this employers' representative for as long as his life is in danger.(c) Regretting that the inquiry into the bomb attack against the COSEP headquarters on  December  still does not appear to have been concluded, the Committee points out that a climate of violence such as one in which the premises and property of workers' and employers' organizations are attacked is a serious obstacle to the exercise of their rights, and that such acts require severe measures to be taken by the authorities. The Committee requests the Government to step up the inquiry under way into this attack and to keep it informed of its outcome.(d) The Committee expresses its concern at the acts of violence alleged in this case, and would like to draw the attention of Government to the fact that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against such organizations' leaders and members, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected. The Committee expresses its firm hope that the Government will take all possible measures to ensure respect of this principle.",0,1993,Nicaragua
76,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the ""Nora Astorga"" Trade Union (affiliated to the Sandinista Central of Workers - CST) dated  October . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  October , the ""Nora Astorga"" Trade Union in the ""Supermercados Internacionales S.A."" enterprise (an enterprise belonging to the State of Nicaragua attached to the Tourist Corporation of Nicaragua which, in turn, is part of the National Public Sector Corporation) alleges that the Tourist Corporation of Nicaragua, with a view to transferring ownership of ""Supermercados Internacionales S.A."" to private sector employers, has ordered the closing down of the enterprise and recognized only the following social benefits to workers: holiday pay, bonus and one-month wages in lieu of advance notice.
.The complainant adds that this is contrary to the collective agreement signed on  June  between the workers and the employer, which had been ratified by the Directorate of Conciliation of the Ministry of Labour. Clause  of this collective agreement provides for compensation of one month's wages for each year worked, up to a maximum of six years, if workers are dismissed without just cause.
.The complainant concludes by pointing out that both the employer and the legal adviser of the Ministry of Labour (which held a consultation on the matters raised by this case) refuse to recognize the collective agreement and have declared it null and void.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the consultations held on this matter at the request of the complainant trade union by the Director of the Legal Division of the Ministry of Labour were consonant with the provisions of the labour legislation in force. The Government points out that the content of the ruling by the Legal Division has been distorted by the complainant and is in fact as follows:In the event of the closing of an enterprise due to force majeure and external causes beyond the control of the workers as in the case of privatization, first preference shall be given to the payment of social benefits (to workers) such as advance notice (a month's wage), holidays in proportion to the time worked, thirteenth month of wages and wages outstanding.In such cases there shall be negotiation between the enterprise and the workers with a view to obtaining from the enterprise some compensation for the workers.In accordance with the provisions of section () of the Labour Code, the collective agreement shall terminate with the total closing of the enterprise. The disappearance of the trade name of the enterprise shall result in the disappearance of the employer and the collective agreement will cease to have any legal effect.If there is a change in the ownership of the enterprise, the collective agreement would have to be updated with the new owners.
.The issue in this case is whether a collective agreement or more specifically - as the complainant states - its clauses respecting compensation in the event of dismissal are applicable if an enterprise (""Supermercados Internacionales S.A."") has been closed - to use the Government's words - ""due to the force majeure and external causes beyond the control of the workers as in the case of privatization"". The Government points out that under the Labour Code, collective agreements terminate with the total closing of an enterprise, and the disappearance of the trade name of an enterprise results in the disappearance of the employer and of the legal effect of the collective agreement.
.The Committee notes that ""Supermercados Internacionales S.A."" is a limited company of the State of Nicaragua which was closed down, and was subsequently taken over by private sector employers; this enterprise had signed a collective agreement on  June , i.e. four months before the filing of the present complaint ( October ) and thus of the closing of the enterprise.
.The Committee notes that in an earlier case concerning, amongst others, the non-payment of vested entitlements and dismissal compensation provided for in a collective agreement following privatization measures (th Report, Case No.  (Philippines), para. ), it asked the Government to ensure that the appropriate action be taken so that the rights of the dismissed workers would be respected. In the present case, the Committee concludes that the closing of the enterprise in question should not in itself result in the extinction of the obligations on the employer resulting from the collective agreement, in particular as regards compensation in the case of dismissal.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring compliance with the compensation rights in the case of dismissals, resulting from the collective agreement concluded between ""Supermercados Internacionales S.A."" and the ""Nora Astorga"" Trade Union.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to ensuring compliance with the compensation rights in the case of dismissals, resulting from the collective agreement concluded between ""Supermercados Internacionales S.A."" and the ""Nora Astorga"" Trade Union.",0,1992,Nicaragua
77,".The complaint which is the subject of the present case is contained in a communication dated  June  from the Sandinista Workers' Confederation of Nicaragua (CST). The Government's comments were transmitted in the communication dated  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the complainant alleges that once the new Government had assumed power, payroll deductions of trade union dues, which had been done with the full agreement of union members, were suspended unilaterally with the aim of causing economic harm to the National Union of Education Workers - National Association of Teachers (ANDEN). It points out that this was a major achievement by the union ANDEN and was incorporated in numerous collective agreements.
.At the same time, the complainant organization alleges that a campaign of persecution has been unleashed against ANDEN leaders, nine of whom have suffered unfair dismissal at the following places: the town of la Concepcin (Masaya District); the town of Sebaco (Matagalpa District); Ometepe Island (Rivas District); the Ministry of Education Headquarters; the City of Sandino (Managua District); and the capital, Managua.
.Finally, the complainant organization claims that after a new executive board of ANDEN had been elected in September , the Ministry of Labour was asked by the Ministry of Education to withhold recognition of the new executive on the grounds of irregularities of form. It points out that, as a result of the request, the Ministry of Labour rejected the application to register the board, thus refusing to bring its legal status up to date or to recognize the authorized representatives.
.In its communication of  October , the Government refers to the comments it made in connection with Case No.  (cf. th Report of the Committee, para. ), relating specifically to the allegation that payroll deductions of trade union dues had been suspended. With regard to the alleged dismissals of union leaders, the Government states that no complaint has been filed.
.Finally, with regard to the claim that registration of the new executive board of ANDEN was refused by the Ministry of Labour, the Government states that, according to a written document submitted by the Ministry of Education, the elected members were not employed by that Ministry. It explains that the Directorate of Trade Union Associations issued a resolution on the matter, which stated the necessity of restructuring the elected executive board of ANDEN on the basis of membership by non-management employees with a professional connection to the Ministry of Education, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code and sections , ,  and  of the Trade Union Regulations. Finally, the Government points out that on  August  the executive committee of ANDEN was registered since there was no objection by the current administration of the Ministry of Education to the leaders of ANDEN on the grounds of their not working for that Ministry or occupying managerial positions. The Government points out that an application for protection (amparo) has been lodged by the union in question and is now before the Supreme Court.
.As regards the alleged ban on payroll deductions of trade union dues, the Committee notes that it has already dealt with this claim in its examination of Case No.  (Nicaragua) in November . On that occasion, the Committee noted the existence of a ministerial resolution banning the deduction from payrolls of union subscriptions, while also noting the Government's comments that the resolution in question allows employers to deduct trade union dues at the source wherever this is expressly authorized by workers. Under these circumstances, the Committee reaffirms the conclusions reached at its last meeting (cf. th Report of the Committee, para. ), in which it requested the Government ""to take the necessary steps to amend this resolution so that its provisions are aligned with the practice described by the Government, and established through collective agreements"".
.As regards the alleged dismissals of nine ANDEN leaders in different parts of the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement that no complaint has been lodged. The Committee asks the Government to investigate the grounds for such dismissals and, in the event of their being motivated by anti-union reasons, to reinstate the dismissed leaders in their posts. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on this matter.
.As regards the refusal by the Ministry of Labour to register the new executive of ANDEN, the Committee notes the Government's statement that it was based on the fact that various members of this new executive board were not employed by the Ministry of Education, or occupied managerial positions. The Committee notes that registration subsequently took place, no objections having been expressed by the current administration of the Ministry of Labour. The Committee also notes that the union ANDEN has lodged an application for protection (amparo) with the Supreme Court against the initial refusal to register, grounds for which were the fact that members of the executive were not Ministry of Education personnel.
.Under those circumstances, the Committee reminds the Government that it is the prerogative of workers' and employers' organizations to determine the conditions for electing their leaders, and that the authorities should refrain from any undue interference in the exercise of that right, which is established in Convention No. . The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the Supreme Court's ruling on the application for protection relating to conditions for the election of union leaders.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee again requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend the ministerial resolution concerning the prohibition of trade union check-off, so that its provisions are aligned with the practice described by the Government and established through collective agreements.(b) The Committee requests the Government to investigate the grounds for the dismissal of the nine ANDEN leaders referred to by the complainant and, in the event that the dismissals were based on anti-union reasons, to reinstate them in their posts. The Committee asks the Government to keep it informed on this matter.(c) Drawing the Government's attention to the principle that the authorities should refrain from any undue interference in the exercise of the right of workers' and employers' organizations freely to elect their representatives, which is guaranteed by Convention No. , the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the application for protection (amparo) lodged by the union ANDEN.",0,1992,Nicaragua
78,".The Committee examined this case at its November  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), at which it formulated interim conclusions.
.The Government sent partial observations in communications dated January and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its previous examination of the case, when it examined the alleged arrest of trade union leaders and members, the Committee urged the Government to provide information on the situation of the following persons who had been arrested (see th Report, paras.  and (b)): the trade union leaders Juan Urea, Tiburcio Vilchez, Albenis Mercado and Dadryl Ostil, arrested on  August , at the San Pablo ranch; Vicente Mendoza Jimnez, Luis Manuel Martnez Mesa, Julio David Tercero Rojas, Ral Corea, Emilio Ferrufino Gonzlez Dvila, Jos Ramn Rayo Rivera, Ramn Surez, Marcos Surez, Daniel Espinoza, Miguel Martnez Aguilar, Mario Jos Hernandes Silva, Leonardo Silva, Mario Ros, Emilio Crdoba Ayala, Pedro Silva Ulloa, Pedro Silva Suazo, Rodolfo Hernndez, Oscar Danilo Altamirano, Juan Ramn Garca, Norberto Jirn, Nicols Daz and Juan Jos Ulloa Silva, arrested at the La Alsacia ranch; Sergio Guido, the General Secretary of the trade union and three union members, arrested at the Santa Mara de Ostuma ranch; and the trade union leaders Ricardo Salas Garca, Germn Prez Surez, Felipe Gmez Gonzlez and Luis Loaisiga Lpez, arrested at the Los Placeres ranch.
.The Committee also urged the Government to provide information on: (i) the result of the judicial investigation into the murder of the trade unionist Mr. Gutirrez Rayo; (ii) the charges that have been brought against the workers of the AERONICA national airline who were released on bail and any sentences handed down; (iii) whether the workers of the ENABUS enterprise mentioned by the complainants have been released or if they are still in detention, and whether any charges have been brought against them; (iv) the certificate of registration of the  rural unions referred to by the complainants in their initial complaint (see th Report, para. (e)).
.In its communications dated  January and  February , the Government states that: () the investigation into the death of trade unionist Jos Antonio Gutirrez Rayo concluded that it was the result of a confrontation between rebels and the national police and that the incident had nothing to do with trade unionism; () the problems involving the AERONICA national airline and ENABUS have been resolved; () the certificates of registration of the rural unions referred to by the complainant organizations were attached to the Government's reply. Finally, the Government states that, since the allegations date back several years (), it is impossible for it to obtain any further information.
.The Committee notes that the allegations that were still pending or on which it had requested information relate to the death of a trade unionist and the arrest of trade union leaders and members, and to the registration of trade unions.
.Regarding the death of trade unionist Gutirrez Rayo, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the investigation that was conducted into the matter concluded that it was the result of a confrontation between rebels and the national police and that the incident had nothing to do with trade unionism.
.With regard to the Committee's request for information on the charges that have been brought against the workers of the AERONICA national airline who were released on bail and on whether the workers of the ENABUS enterprise who had been arrested had been released, the Committee notes the Government's statement that these problems have been resolved.
.With regard to the arrest of the union leaders and members referred to by name in the San Pablo, La Alsacia, Santa Mara de Ostuma and Los Placeres ranches, the Committee notes that the Government has not made known concrete observations.
.The Committee cannot accept the Government's argument that, since the allegations presented date back several years (), it is therefore impossible for it to obtain any further information on the subject. The Committee deeply regrets the Government's incomplete replies or failure to communicate its observations ever since this case was first brought to its attention. The Committee stresses that ""the arrest of trade union leaders against whom no charge is brought involves restrictions on freedom of association, and governments should adopt measures for issuing appropriate instructions to prevent the danger involved for trade union activities by such arrests. Furthermore, it is clear that such arrests create an atmosphere of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal development of trade union activities"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ).
.In these circumstances, and inasmuch as the Government does not deny that the numerous union leaders and members referred to were arrested or merely states that the problems have been overcome, the Committee notes that the Government has not denied that the arrests may have been on anti-union grounds. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps to have the union leaders and members referred to released immediately, if they are still under detention. Moreover, the Committee calls on the Government to fully respect freedom of association and to take the necessary steps to protect trade union activities and to ensure in future that trade unionists, against whom no charges have been brought by a judicial body, are not detained or arrested.
.Finally, with regard to the alleged refusal of the Ministry of Labour to register  rural unions in the private sector, a copy of whose certificate of registration the Committee had asked the Government to send it, the Committee takes due note that the Government has now sent those certificates. Consequently the Committee considers that this matter does not call for further examination.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Recalling that the arrest of trade union leaders against whom no charge is subsequently brought constitutes a restriction on freedom of association and that governments should adopt measures for issuing appropriate instructions to prevent the danger involved for trade union activities by such arrests, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to have the union leaders and members referred to by the complainant organizations released immediately if they are still under detention.(b) The Committee calls on the Government to fully respect freedom of association and to take the necessary steps to protect trade union activities and to ensure in future that union leaders or members, against whom no charges have been brought by a judicial body, are not arrested or detained.
.The Committee examined this case and at its June  meeting (see th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (June )) in which it formulated interim conclusions.
.Due to the absence of information from the Government regarding the allegations, the Committee has twice had to postpone its examination of this case. At its June  meeting, the Committee drew the Government's attention to the fact that, in accordance with the procedural rules set out in paragraph  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), it would present a report on the substance of this case at its next meeting, even if the observations or information requested had not been received in due time (see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (June ), para. ). To date, the Government has still not sent its observations.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the previous examination of the case by the Committee, at its June  meeting (see th Report, para. ), the following allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists and break-ins at trade union premises and the residences of trade unionists and trade union leaders remained pending: the arrest of the trade union leaders Juan Urea, Tiburcio Vilchez, Albenis Mercado and Dadryl Ostil on  August  at the San Pablo ranch; the suppression and subsequent imprisonment of  workers at the La Alsacia ranch (Vicente Mendoz Jimnez, Luis Manuel Martnez Mesa, Julio David Tercero Rojas, Ral Corea, Emilio Ferrufino Gonzlez Dvila, Jos Ramn Rayo Rivera, Ramn Surez, Marcos Surez, Daniel Espinoza, Miguel Martnez Aguilar, Mario Jos Hernandes Silva, Leonardo Silva, Mario Ros, Emilio Crdoba Ayala, Pedro Silva Ulloa, Pedro Silva Suazo, Rodolfo Hernndez, Oscar Danilo Altamirano, Juan Ramn Garca, Norberto Jirn, Nicols Daz and Juan Jos Ulloa Silva); the arrests at the Santa Mara de Ostuma ranch (Sergio Guido, the General Secretary of the trade union and three union members) and at the Los Placeres ranch (Ricardo Salas Garca, Germn Prez Surez, Felipe Gmez Gonzlez and Luis Loaisiga Lpez, all trade union leaders); the break-in at the trade union premises at the La",0,1992,Nicaragua
79,"Candelaria ranch by the ranch's owner and his bodyguards, and the confiscation of documents; and the break-in at the residence of the ATC trade union leader, Mrs. Ramona Castelln.
.The Government was requested to send its observations on the alleged anti-union dismissals at the La Luz ranch ( trade unionists); the La Queserita ranch (three trade union leaders); the El Olocotn ranch (three trade union leaders); the La Cruz ranch (two trade union leaders); the El Blsamo, Imperio, Roma, Holanda and San Miguel farms ( workers, including  trade union leaders); the Los Millonarios ranch ( workers); the Santa Celia ranch (six ATC members); the Montpellier ranch ( union members); the La Rondalla ranch ( union members) and the El Quetzal ranch (six union members); and the dismissal of the trade union leader Julin Martnez from the La Candelaria ranch.
.Lastly, the Committee requested the Government to keep it informed about the investigation into the death of the trade unionist Mr. Gutirrez Rayo, to indicate which charges have been filed against the workers of the AERONICA national airline who were released on bail, communicating any sentences handed down, to indicate whether the workers of the ENABUS enterprise (Gernimo Blandon Leiva, Richard Wellcome, Jos Corrales, Luis Snchez Duarte, Jos Hidalgo, Sergio Rocha, Silvio Jarquin and Guillermo Urbina), who were arrested by the police, have been released or are still in detention, and whether any charges were brought against them; and to provide the certificate of registration of the  rural unions referred to by the complainants in their initial complaint.
.In addition, the Committee invited the complainant organizations to transmit the information requested by the Government relating to the alleged arrest of two trade unionists (Flix Castillo Castro and Jos Dolores Castillo Zeledn) at the Wapinol Cooperative, in order for the Government to reply to these allegations.
.First, the Committee deeply deplores the fact that the Government has not sent the requested information or observations concerning the numerous serious allegations that remained pending, despite the time elapsed since the presentation of the complaint and despite the request made for the Government to formulate its comments and observations on a number of occasions, including through an urgent appeal.
.In these circumstances, and in accordance with the applicable procedural rule (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )), the Committee is obliged to present a report on the substance of this case without being able to take into account the information it was waiting to receive from the Government.
.The Committee reminds the Government that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part will recognize the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies relating to the substance of allegations made against them (see First Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in March ).
.The Committee notes that the allegations that remained pending from its examination of the case in June  are grave and refer to the death of a trade union leader, to acts of violence, arrests and break-ins at trade union premises and the residences of trade unionists and trade union leaders and to anti-union dismissals from various enterprises, as well as the question of the effective registration of rural organizations.
.As a general remark, the Committee wishes to point out to the Government that ""freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed"" (see rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. , and th Report, Cases Nos.  (Peru), para. , and  (Guatemala), para. ).
.As regards the allegations concerning arrests, the Committee notes that the pending allegations relate to: () the arrest on  August  at the San Pablo ranch of the trade union leaders mentioned by the complainants; () the imprisonment of  workers of the La Alsacia ranch mentioned by the complainants; and () the arrests that took place at the Santa Mara de Ostuma and the Los Placeres ranches. In this respect, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that ""the detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights and an infringement of freedom of association"" (see st Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ), and urges the Government to inform it on the situation of these persons and of any charges brought against them.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the break-in at the residence of the ATC trade union leader, Mrs. Ramona Castelln, and the break-in at the trade union premises at the La Candelaria ranch by the ranch's owner and his bodyguards and the confiscation of documents, the Committee calls the Government's attention to the fact that ""it is stated in the resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (), that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights"" (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ) and stresses that ""any search of trade union premises, or of unionists' homes, without a court order, constitutes an extremely serious infringement of freedom of association"" (see th Report, Cases Nos. , ,  and  (El Salvador), para. , and th Report, Case No.  (Russian Federation), para. ). In these circumstances, deploring the alleged break-ins, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to return the documents confiscated during the break-in at the trade union headquarters at the La Calendaria ranch and to take the necessary steps to ensure that this sort of incident does not happen again.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the numerous anti-union dismissals at various ranches and farms in the country, the Committee notes that the allegations pending refer to dismissals at the La Luz ranch ( trade unionists); the La Queserita ranch (three trade union leaders); the El Olocotn ranch (three trade union leaders); the La Cruz ranch (two trade union leaders); the El Blsamo, Imperio, Roma, Holanda and San Miguel farms ( workers, including  trade union leaders); the Los Millonarios ranch ( workers); the Santa Celia ranch (six ATC members); the Montpellier ranch ( union members); the La Rondalla ranch ( union members); and the El Quetzal ranch (six union members); and to the dismissal of the trade union leader Julin Martnez (La Calendaria ranch). In this connection, the Committee wishes to remind the Government that ""the dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organization or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association"" (see st Report, Case No.  (Paraguay), para. ). In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government immediately to take the necessary steps for an independent inquiry to be carried out into the alleged dismissals and for the reinstatement in their jobs of all those workers who were dismissed as a result of the exercise of their legitimate trade union activities.
.With regard to the alleged arrest of the trade unionists Flix Castillo Castro and Jos Dolores Castillo Zeledn at the Wapinol Cooperative, the Committee notes with regret that the complainant organizations have not responded to the Committee's request to inform it of the dates and grounds of their arrest.
.Lastly, the Committee repeats its request for the Government to provide information on: (i) the result of the judicial investigation into the murder of the trade unionist Mr. Gutirrez Rayo; (ii) the charges that have been brought against the workers of the AERONICA national airline who were released on bail and any sentences handed down; (iii) whether the workers of the ENABUS enterprise referred to by the complainants have been released or if they are still in detention, and whether any charges have been brought against them; and (iv) the certificate of registration of the  rural unions mentioned by the complainants in their initial complaint.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply regrets that despite the time which elapsed since the presentation of the complaint and despite the urgent appeal which was made, the Government has not presented its comments or observations on many of the allegations.(b) Recalling that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed, and that the detention of trade unionists on the grounds of trade union activities constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights and an infringement of freedom of association, the Committee",-1,1992,Nicaragua
80,"urges the Government once again to provide information on the situation of the arrested trade unionists referred to by the complainant organizations, and of any charges brought against them.(c) Deploring the alleged break-ins, to which the Government has not replied, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary measures to return the documents confiscated during the break-in of the headquarters of the trade union at the La Candelaria ranch and to take the necessary steps to ensure that such an incident does not happen again.(d) Reminding the Government that the dismissal of workers on grounds of membership of an organization or trade union activities violates the principles of freedom of association, the Committee urges the Government to take the necessary steps immediately for an independent investigation to be carried out into the alleged dismissals and to reinstate in their jobs all those workers who were dismissed as a result of the exercise of their legitimate trade union activities.(e) The Committee urges once again the Government to provide information on: (i) the result of the judicial investigation into the murder of the trade unionist Mr. Gutirrez Rayo; (ii) the charges that have been brought against the workers of the AERONICA national airline who were released on bail and any sentences handed down; (iii) whether the workers of the ENABUS enterprise mentioned by the complainants have been released or if they are still in detention, and whether any charges have been brought against them; (iv) the certificate of registration of the  rural unions referred to by the complainants in their initial complaint.
.The complaint in this case is contained in a joint communication from the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) and the Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC), dated  May . Later, in a communication of  December , the Agricultural Workers' Association presented new allegations. The Government sent its observations in communications of  October and  December ,  July  and  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication of  May , the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) and the Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC) refer to protests against the consequences of the Government's stabilization plan (unemployment, high levels of poverty and infant mortality, etc.) and specifically make the following allegations:- the National Bus Company (ENABUS): when workers carried out a protest to demand that the terms of their employment contract with the Ministry of Construction and Transport be observed, the police attacked them to put down the protest, arresting some and injuring eight (Gernimo Blandon Leiva, Richard Wellcome, Jos Corrales, Luis Snchez Duarte, Jos Hidalgo, Sergio Rocha, Silvio Jarquin and Guillermo Urbina);- AERONICA National Airlines:  workers were detained as a result of a dispute between workers and the company's management; they were accused of reckless endangerment.

An appeal for amparo (enforcement of constitutional rights) has been lodged with the Court of Appeals;- the La Queserita ranch: three trade union leaders (Bayardo Martiney, Vctor Manuel Juarez and Noel Martnez) were dismissed because they demanded that the social benefits owed to four retired workers who are members of the union be paid;- the El Olocotn ranch: three trade union leaders were dismissed (Danilo Machado, Mara Luisa Salinas and Bernarda Gonzales);- the La Cruz ranch: two trade union leaders were dismissed (Augusto Canales and Bertha Areas);- the Los Millonarios ranch:  workers were dismissed, including the union's General Secretary, because a strike was declared illegal;- the San Carlos ranch: the following workers were beaten and detained: Lino de Jess Martnez, David Santiago Reyes, Aurelio Ramrez, Hctor Moncada, Antonio Maradiaga, Nicols Tllez, Santos Apolonio Lpez, Eugenio Velzquez, Mariano Quintero and Bernardo Lpez;- the La Ofelia ranch: the trade union leaders Secundino Hernndez, Cristino Prez, Hermgenes Juarez, Jos Prez, Ins Martnez and Domingo Rivera were beaten and arrested;- the La Pistola ranch: the trade union leaders Miguel Jimnez, Vctor Gmez and Ren Gradiz Aguilar were arrested and beaten;- the La Candelaria ranch: the ranch's owner and his bodyguards attacked the premises of the Mercedes Mayorga Trade Union and confiscated union documents.

They were later released and their cases were dismissed;- the Santa Josefina ranch: on  June  four ATC trade unionists were arrested, and were later released by a judicial order;- the El Tuma-La Dalia de Matagalpa region: four ATC trade union leaders were arrested (Jorge Gonzlez Hernndez, Isidoro Aguilar Miranda, Nicols Aguilar Miranda and Entimo Lpez Salgado) on  June , and were accused of unlawful occupation of private property. They are still in detention;- the Santa Gertrudis ranch: the trade union leader, Omar Antonio Matute Talavera, was arrested and imprisoned;- the Pantasma region: nine trade unionists were arrested and imprisoned (Ivn Silva, Ins Zeledn, Hilario Silva, Paulino Silva, Willam Martnez, Dionisio Silva, Bayardo Barrera, Flix Silva and Julio Csar Pastora);- the Santa Mara de Ostuma ranch: the trade union leader, Sergio Guido, and three union members were arrested;- the Los Placeres ranch: four trade union leaders were arrested (Ricardo Salas Garca, Germn Prez Suarez, Felipe Gmez Gonzlez and Luis Loaisiga Lpez);- the Wapinol Cooperative: the trade unionists Flix Castillo Castro and Jos Dolres Castillo Zeledn were arrested;- the Las Rosas ranch: two trade union leaders were arrested on  November  and were later released;- the Santa Celia ranch: the Ministry of Labour stated that it was not competent to reinstate six members of the ATC who were dismissed because they demanded that the collective agreement be observed;- the San Pablo ranch: the trade union leaders Juan Urea, Tiburcio Vilchez, Albenis Mercado and Dadryl Ostil were arrested on  August ;- the El Blsamo, Imperio, Roma, Holanda and San Miguel farms:  workers, including  trade union leaders, were dismissed; and- the residence of the ATC's trade union leader, Mrs. Ramona Castelln, was searched unlawfully.
.In its communication of  December , the Agricultural Workers' Association (ATC) presented the following allegations:
.The complainant organizations also present allegations which have already been examined by the Committee in Cases Nos.  and .
.In its first reply, the Government states that, as regards the allegations concerning AERONICA National Airlines, after several months of negotiations between the Transport Workers' Federation, the Aernica Trade Union and the Government, the union broke off negotiations and declared a strike. According to the Government, the union claimed that the enterprise was being sold behind the workers' backs, in violation of consultation agreements which gave them a  per cent stake in the airline; the workers occupied the company's facilities and blocked runways with airplanes, causing significant financial losses and endangering the lives of others. The Government reports",1,1992,Nicaragua
81,"that the police cleared the aircraft from the runways and arrested several workers involved in the demonstration. They were released after their cases were brought before a court (four were released on bail: Luis Torres Paguagua, Ismael Rueda, Leonardo Sebero Torres and Jacinto Rener Vallejos). Finally, the Government indicates that the Ministry of Labour invited members of the Aernica Trade Union to participate in negotiations on various occasions, but since they would not attend it was decided to close the enterprise.
.The Government adds that:- as regards the alleged dismissal of the ATC's trade union leaders, no complaint has been presented to the Ministry of Labour;- the General Inspectorate of Labour has no record of any declaration of an illegal strike at the Los Millonarios ranch;- as regards the case of the Companic S.A. company, the complainants have revoked their complaint to the ILO, as the parties came to an agreement and resolved the dispute; and- as regards the alleged refusal to register rural trade unions, there is full and complete freedom of association in Nicaragua and the Directorate for Trade Union Associations processes all registration requests that are submitted and provides prompt replies. In the case of the trade unions mentioned by the complainants, they were registered within the legally established time-limits. The Government explains that the Directorate for Trade Union Associations requested the collaboration of the enterprise-level associations to help determine the unionization rate in the country, and thus inquired as to the number of trade union members and the total number of workers when the association was an enterprise union.
.In its communication of  December , the Government states that:- as regards the allegations concerning the National Bus Company (ENABUS), a group of workers violently blocked the access roads to the Ministry of Construction and Transport, paralysing transport. The intervention of the police was necessary to restore order. The demonstrators responded by attacking the police;- as regards the allegations concerning the Montpellier, La Rondalla, El Quetzal, San Carlos, Ofelia and La Pistola ranches, the problems encountered have nothing to do with labour and union questions, and are related to the occupation and ownership of land. These problems result from the return to their rightful owners of previously confiscated and illegally occupied properties. The Government established a reserve of land for the resettlement of the illegal occupants, but they refused to hand over the land they were occupying;- as regards the El Paraso ranch, nine workers were temporarily suspended from their jobs, but were reinstated ten days later when the company's economic health was restored;- as regards the death of Jos Antonio Gutirrez Rayo, a commission comprising inter alia representatives of the ""Revueltos"" leadership (workers) and the Ministry of the Interior reported that on  April  the police broke up a barricade located on the Pan-American highway, and that an armed clash later took place in which one policeman and a member of the group of protesters were injured. Mr. Gutirrez Rayo was fatally injured some , metres from where the barricade was, and it was later proved that some of the demonstrators were armed. The Government also reports that judicial investigations are under way to determine who is responsible for these acts.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that:- the eight trade union leaders of the ATC who were arrested were accused of threatening lives and property, and that they were released following the appropriate investigations;- the arrest of the workers at the La Colonia farm took place under a court order, as they were accused of unlawfully occupying private property and threatening to kill the property owner;- the workers at the La Josefina ranch were arrested under a court order, based on the ranch owner's complaint to a criminal court judge of death threats made against her; they were released because of a lack of sufficient proof;- as regards the arrest of Jorge Gonzlez Hernndez, the trade union leader of the ATC, and others (El Tuma region), neither the Matagalpa provincial delegation nor the police took part in these acts;- as regards the arrest of the trade union leader Omar Antonio Matute Talavera at the Santa Gertrudis ranch, and the arrest of trade unionists Ivn Silva, Ins Zeledn and others in the Pantasma region, neither the national police nor the courts are aware of such acts;- in the case of the Santa Mara de Ostuma ranch, the ranch was returned to its owner, as it had been unjustly confiscated by the previous Government; there were no arrests;- at the Los Placeres ranch there were no arrests;- Aurelio Traa and Rosalio Gonzlez of the Las Rosas ranch were arrested as part of an investigation into a killing which took place near the ranch; they were later released;- there is no information regarding the alleged dismissals at the Santa Celia ranch, but a list of claims has been presented and is now the subject of negotiations;- as regards the alleged arrest of Pedro Castillo Castro and other members of the Wapinol Cooperative, the reasons and dates of arrest are unknown and it is thus impossible to provide any information.
.Finally, the Government points out that the previous Government unjustly and arbitrarily confiscated property and that, as part of the national reconciliation process, a special commission of jurists was established for a specific period to hear the cases of people reclaiming their land. Based on the rulings of this commission, the Government returned certain properties to their owners, and this caused unrest among the people illegally occupying these lands. They threatened the owners and damaged their property. In these circumstances, the owners turned to the legal system to ensure that their rights were respected.
.The Committee notes that the allegations in this case refer to one case of murder, to physical attacks, arrests and break-ins at trade union premises and the residences of trade union leaders and trade unionists, and to anti-union dismissals and other violations of trade union rights at various enterprises.
.As regards the murder of trade unionist Jos Antonio Gutirrez Rayo, the Committee notes that the Government reports that the police broke up a demonstration by workers on the Pan-American highway and that an armed confrontation later took place, injuring a policeman and a member of the group of demonstrators, that the trade unionist in question was fatally injured some , metres from where the police broke up the demonstration, and that it has been proved that some of the demonstrators were armed. Similarly, the Committee notes that judicial investigations are under way to determine who is responsible for these acts. In these circumstances, the Committee deplores this murder and trusts that the investigations will be concluded quickly and that the guilty parties will be punished. In the meantime, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in these investigations.
.The Committee takes note of the observations presented by the Government concerning the arrest of trade union leaders and trade unionists. Specifically:- as regards the trade union leaders and trade unionists of the ATC, the Santa Josefina ranch and the Las Rosas ranch who were arrested (eight trade union leaders, four trade unionists and two trade union leaders, respectively), the Government reports that they were arrested by judicial order, as they were accused of committing or participating in criminal offences, but that their release was ordered after the appropriate investigations took place;- as regards the workers arrested at the La Colonia farm (five trade union leaders who were later released), the Government points out that they were arrested by judicial order, as they were accused of unlawfully occupying private property and threatening to kill the owner.
.Noting that the workers mentioned in these allegations were arrested by judicial order and were later released because the charges against them were dropped, the Committee should like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction were subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger which arrest for trade union activities implies (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ).
.As regards the allegations concerning AERONICA National Airlines (the arrest of  workers for taking part in a demonstration on charges of reckless endangerment, and the prosecution of the union's General Secretary, Luis Torres Paguagua, and three other workers), the Committee notes that the Government mentions that the workers occupied the company's facilities and blocked runways with aircraft, causing significant financial losses and endangering the lives of others, and that the police arrested several workers who were involved in the demonstration, and who were later released (four of whom were released on bail: Luis Torres Paguagua, Ismael Rueda, Leonardo Sebero Torres and Jacinto Rener Vallejos). In the light of these statements, and before taking a position, the Committee requests the Government to indicate which",0,1992,Nicaragua
82,"charges have been filed against the workers released on bail and to communicate any sentences handed down.
.As regards the allegations concerning violent acts at the National Bus Company (ENABUS) (physical assault against workers demanding the implementation of an agreement, resulting in the injury and arrest of eight people: Gernimo Blandn Leiva, Richard Wellcome, Jos Corrales, Luis Snchez Duarte, Jos Hidalgo, Sergio Rocha, Silvio Jarqun and Guillermo Urbina), the Committee notes that, according to the Government, a group of workers forcefully blocked the access roads to the Ministry of Construction and Transport, paralysing traffic, that the intervention of the police was necessary to restore order and that the demonstrators responded by attacking the police. The Committee observes that the Government does not refer to the allegations of physical assault and arrests. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to establish a judicial investigation so as to establish the facts, determine who is responsible and punish the guilty parties. Similarly, it requests the Government to indicate whether the workers mentioned by the complainants have been released or are still in detention, and whether any charges were brought, and are still pending against them.
.The Committee also takes note of the Government's observations concerning various allegations of acts of violence:- as regards the arrest of four trade union leaders of the ATC in the El Tuma-La Dalia de Matagalpa region, the Government states that neither the provincial delegation in Matagalpa nor the police took part in these acts;- as regards the arrest of a trade union leader at the Santa Gertrudis ranch, and the arrest of nine trade unionists in the Pantasma region, the Government reports that neither the national police nor the courts have any record of such acts;- as regards the allegations concerning the San Carlos, Ofelia and La Pistol ranches (physical assault and arrest of ten, five and three trade union leaders, respectively), according to the Government these events have nothing to do with labour and trade union questions, and are related to problems of the occupation and ownership of land;- as regards allegations concerning the Santa Mara de Ostuma ranch (the arrest of four trade unionists) and the Los Placeres ranch (the arrest of four trade unionists), the Government denies that these arrests took place.
.Observing that, except in the case of the Santa Mara de Ostuma and Los Placeres ranches, in which the Government categorically denies the allegations, the Government simply replies that there was no government participation, that it has no knowledge of these acts or that the acts are related to a question of the occupation or ownership of land, the Committee deeply regrets that no details have been provided concerning these allegations and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the appropriate judicial investigations take place in all cases involving allegations of physical assault or the arrest of trade union leaders and trade unionists, and to provide particulars on the situation of those allegedly detained.
.As regards the allegation of the arrest of two trade unionists at the Wapinol Cooperative (Pedro Castillo Castro and Jos Dolores Castillo Zeledn), the Committee takes note that the Government mentions that it is impossible to provide information, as neither the dates nor the reasons for the arrests are specified. The Committee invites the complainant organizations to communicate the information requested by the Government so as to permit the Government to reply to these allegations.
.The Committee also observes that the Government has not communicated its observations concerning the following allegations: the break-in by the owner of the La Candelaria ranch and his bodyguards into the ranch's trade union premises and the confiscation of documents; the arrest of trade union leaders Juan Urea, Tiburcio Vilchez, Albenis Mercado and Dadryl Ostil on  August  at the San Pablo ranch; the break-in at the residence of the ATC's trade union leader, Ramona Castelln; and the arrest and subsequent imprisonment of  workers of the Alsacia ranch. The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations on these allegations as quickly as possible.
.In general, as regards all these allegations of murder, physical assaults and arrests of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee deeply deplores the numerous serious acts of violence, and expresses its concern, observing that they have affected a significant number of trade union leaders and trade unionists. The Committee points out that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against trade unionists and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.As regards the numerous allegations of anti-union dismissals, the Committee takes note of the Government's observations. Specifically:
.Observing that, as regards the dismissals at the Montpellier, La Rondalla and El Quetzal ranches, the Government simply states that there were problems related to the occupation or ownership of land, and that with regard to the other allegations it simply replies that it is unaware of the acts alleged to have occurred but in no way denies that all these dismissals took place, the Committee requests the Government to communicate to it detailed information concerning all these allegations. Similarly, the Committee reminds the Government in general terms that no one should be subject to anti-trade union discrimination for carrying out legitimate trade union activities and that ""protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should cover not only hiring and dismissal but also any discriminatory measures during employment, in particular transfers, downgrading and other acts that are prejudicial to the worker"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.The Committee further observes that the Government has not sent information on the dismissals at: () the La Luz ranch ( trade unionists); () the La Queserita ranch (three trade union leaders); () the El Olocotn ranch (three trade union leaders); () the La Cruz ranch (two trade union leaders); () the El Blsamo, Imperio, Roma, Holanda and San Miguel farms ( workers, including  trade union leaders); and () the dismissal of the trade union leader Julin Martnez (La Candelaria ranch). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the specific reasons for these dismissals, so as to permit it to reach conclusions concerning these cases.
.As regards the allegation concerning the anti-union dismissals at the Companic S.A. company, the Committee notes with interest that the Government states that the workers have retracted their complaint, as the parties reached an agreement and resolved the dispute (the Government encloses with its reply a communication from the company's workers). Similarly, as regards the allegation concerning the dismissal of nine workers from the El Paraso ranch, the Committee notes with interest that the Government reports that these workers were temporarily suspended from their jobs but were reinstated ten days later, once the company's economic health was restored.
.As regards the allegation to the effect that the Ministry of Labour's central delegation prohibited the registration of  rural trade unions in the private sector unless a requirement was met specifying that the farm owners should provide a certificate indicating the number of workers in each production unit, the Committee notes that the Government denies this allegation, contends that the trade unions mentioned by the complainants were registered in the legally established time-limits, and that in actual fact the unions at the enterprise level were requested to communicate the number of union members and the total number of workers when the union was an enterprise union, so as to establish the unionization rate in the country. The Committee asks the Government to provide the certificate of registration of the  unions referred to by the complainant.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) Regretting that the Government has not replied to numerous allegations referring to serious acts of violence and various violations of trade union rights, the Committee urges the Government to reply promptly, and in general draws its attention to the fact that trade union rights can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind.(b) Deploring the killing of trade unionist Gutirrez Rayo, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of the judicial investigations under way.(c) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the charges against the workers of AERONICA National Airlines who were released on bail, and to communicate to it any sentences handed down.(d) The Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that a judicial investigation takes place with the aim of clarifying the events at the National Bus Company (ENABUS), establishing who is responsible and punishing the guilty parties. Similarly, it requests the Government to indicate whether the workers mentioned by the complainants have been released or are still in detention, and whether any charges have been brought and are pending against them.(e) The Committee requests the Government to carry out judicial investigations into the alleged acts of violence in the El Tuma-La",1,1992,Nicaragua
83,"Dalia de Matagalpa region, the Pantasma region and the Santa Gertrudis, San Carlos, Ofelia and La Pistola ranches.(f) The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations as quickly as possible concerning the allegations of break-ins by the owner of the La Candelaria ranch and his bodyguards at the union's premises and the confiscation by them of documents; the arrest of trade union leaders Juan Urea, Tiburcio Vilchez, Albenis Mercado and Dadryl Ostil on  August  at the San Pablo ranch; the break-in at the residence of the ATC's trade union leader, Ramona Castelln; and the repression and subsequent imprisonment of  workers of the Alsacia ranch.(g) The Committee requests the Government to communicate its observations concerning the allegations of dismissals at the Los Millonarios, Santa Celia, Montpellier, La Rondalla and El Quetzal ranches.(h) The Committee requests the Government to report the reasons for the dismissals at the La Luz ranch ( trade unionists); the La Queserita ranch (two trade union leaders); the El Olocotn ranch (three trade union leaders); the La Cruz ranch (two trade union leaders); the El Blsamo, Imperio, Roma, Holanda and San Miguel farms ( workers, including  trade union leaders); and the dismissal of the trade union leader Julin Martnez (La Candelaria ranch).(i) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the allegations concerning the arrests at the ""Santa Mara de Ostuma"" and ""Los Placeres"" farms.(j) The Committee invites the complainant organizations to communicate the information requested by the Government concerning the allegations of the arrest of two trade unionists at the Wapinol Cooperative, so as to permit the Government to reply to these allegations.(k) The Committee requests the Government to transmit the  registration certificates of the rural unions mentioned by the complainants organizations.",-1,1992,Nicaragua
84,".The Committee has examined this case on three occasions (see st, th and th Reports of the Committee, paras.  to ,  to  and  to , respectively, approved by the Governing Body at its nd, th and th Sessions (March and November , and March )), when it submitted interim reports. The Government sent new observations in communications dated  and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As regards the alleged acts of violence by the police against striking workers (the national demonstration of July : four dead and  injured; the strike of workers of the Banco Immobiliario of  April : seven injured; the strike of the workers of the Banco Nacional de Desarrollo of  April : five injured; and the strike at the Olof Palme Convention Centre of  April :  injured), the Committee notes that the Government replied only with respect to the acts of violence during the national unrest and to the strike at the Olof Palme Convention Centre. The Committee takes note of the Government's observations according to which the police intervened in all of these instances with a view to safeguarding the peace, that those detained were released within hours of their arrest, and that no criminal or administrative proceedings have been instituted against the striking workers. Likewise, the Committee notes that a police commission was set up with a view to investigating the facts, but that it was unable to determine individual responsibility owing to the commotion resulting from these events.
.Whilst recognizing the difficulty, noted by the Government, of identifying individual responsibility in the context of tumultuous events, the Committee regrets to note that the investigations entrusted to the police have shed no light on the acts of violence which led to several injuries. The Committee takes note of the fact that the police forces are governed by special legislation and that their members are not judged by the ordinary courts of law; it reminds the Government that on numerous occasions it has pointed out that when the police intervene to break up public meetings or demonstrations, leading to the loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, rd edition, , para. ), and to punish the guilty. In these conditions, the Committee insists on the need for judicial investigations and requests that it be kept informed of the outcome of the same.
.As regards the alleged acts of violence during the collective dispute at the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS), which resulted in several injuries, the Committee notes that the Government states that it has already provided information concerning the opening of judicial proceedings. The Committee reminds the Government that its observations referred to the opening of labour proceedings, but that given the nature of the events ( persons injured according to the complainant, and two according to the Government), the Committee requested that the corresponding judicial investigations be instituted in criminal court. In these conditions, while noting that labour proceedings are under way, the Committee once again requests the Government to institute criminal judicial investigations with a view to shedding light on the acts of violence which took place during the collective dispute at ENABAS, which led to the injury of several persons, and to punishing those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the outcome of these criminal investigations, as of the proceedings in the labour court.
.Lastly, the Committee reminds the Government that ""a genuinely free and independent trade union movement cannot develop in the climate of violence and uncertainty"" (see Digest, op. cit., para. ).
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the alleged acts of violence by the police against striking workers, the Committee deeply regrets to note that the investigations entrusted to the police have shed no light on the acts of violence which led to several injuries. Deploring these deaths and acts of violence, the Committee insists on the need for judicial investigations and criminal sanctions for those found guilty, and requests that it be kept informed of the outcome of the same.(b) As regards the alleged acts of violence during the collective dispute at the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS), which resulted in several injuries, the Committee once again requests the Government to institute criminal judicial investigations with a view to shedding light on the acts of violence which took place during the collective dispute at ENABAS, which led to the injury of several persons, and to punishing those responsible. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed on the outcome of these criminal investigations and of the proceedings under way in the labour court.
.The Committee has examined this case on two occasions (see st and th Reports of the Committee; paras.  to  and  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd and th sessions (March and November )) when it reached interim conclusions. The Government sent new observations in a communication dated  December .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations that remained pending at the Committee's meeting in November  refer to: the alleged acts of violence by the police against strikers (national strike of July : four deaths and  injured; strike of workers in the Banco Inmobiliario on  April : seven injured; strike of workers in the Banco National de Desarrollo on  April : five injured; and the strike in the Olof Palme Convention Centre on  April :  injured); the alleged injuries caused on  March  ( persons injured according to the complainant and two according to the Government), during the collective dispute which arose in the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS); developments in the criminal proceedings against the trade union leader Francisco Somoza, following different events (action by violent strike breakers during the course of a collective dispute) which occurred in the ""Germn Pomares Ordoez"" sugar mill; the organization, promotion and financing of pro-government trade unions; and the police surveillance of the trade union officials responsible for the strikes in the CEMA institution.
.As the Government did not provide sufficiently detailed information on the allegations, the Committee made the following recommendations at its previous examination of the case (see th Report, para. ):- the Committee regrets that the Government did not provide information on the acts of police violence against the strikers, that had been alleged by the complainants (strikes of: July : four deaths and  injured;  April : seven injured;  April : five injured; and  April :  injured). It requests the Government once again to inform the Committee if it has initiated judicial investigations with a view to elucidating the murders of and injuries sustained by the workers taking part in the above-mentioned strikes;- the Committee requests the Government to have judicial inquries carried out into the alleged injuries that were sustained by workers on  March  (according to the complainant,  persons were injured and, according to the Government, two) during the collective dispute which occurred in the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS);- the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the criminal proceedings instigated against the trade union official Francisco Somoza, following the events which occurred in the ""Germn Pomares Ordoez"" sugar mill;- the Committee requests the Government to send, as soon as possible, its observations on the allegation referring to the organization, promotion and financing of pro-government trade unions, and on the police surveillance of the trade union officials responsible for the strikes in the CEMA institution.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government states that it has requested information from the Ministry of the Interior on the allegations concerning the acts of violence by the police against strikers during the holding of different strikes in the months of July  and April .
.As regards the injuries allegedly sustained by workers on  March  ( persons injured according to the complainant and two according to the Government) during the collective dispute which arose in the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS), the Government states that it already provided information on the various proceedings being carried out. In the same way, as regards the criminal proceedings instigated against the trade union official Francisco Somoza, following the events which",0,1991,Nicaragua
85,"occurred in the ""Pomares Ordoez"" sugar mill, the Government states that the trial was closed under the amnesty granted by the President of the Republic.
.As regards the allegations concerning the organization, promotion and financing of pro-government trade unions and the police surveillance of the trade union officials responsible for the strikes in the CEMA institution, the Government rejects these allegations and says that it is logical, following the re-emergence of democracy, that trade union organizations have been set up by workers who wish to see the development of a free and democratic true trade union movement and whose aspirations and thoughts are different from those of the complainant organizations, which in the past were financed and promoted by the previous Government.
.The Committee notes that the Government announces that it will shortly send observations on the allegations concerning the acts of violence by the police against strikers. In these circumstances, the Committee once again asks the Government to open judicial inquiries with a view to elucidating the deaths of and injuries sustained by workers who participated in the mentioned strikes, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome of such inquiries.
.As regards the alleged injuries sustained on  March  by workers ( persons injured according to the complainant and two according to the Government) during the collective dispute which arose in the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS), the Committee notes that the Government replies that it has already provided information on the existence of judicial trials. The Committee recalls that the Government in its previous reply had referred exclusively to labour court proceedings but not to judicial investigations. The Committee therefore regrets that it must once again ask the Government to initiate judicial investigations with a view to elucidating the alleged acts of violence and injuries sustained by different persons and punishing the guilty parties and inform the Committee of the results.
.The Committee notes the observations by the Government that the judicial proceedings against the trade union official Franciso Somoza have been closed under an amnesty granted by the President of the Republic.
.As regards the allegations concerning the organization, promotion and financing of pro-government trade unions and the police surveillance of the trade union officials responsible for the strikes in the CEMA institution, the Committee notes that the Government categorically rejects these allegations and states that, following the re-emergence of democracy, trade union organizations have been set up by workers who wish to see the development of a genuinely free and democratic trade union movement. In these circumstances, given the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's reply, and the lack of details from the complainants on these allegations, the Committee is not in a position to examine this aspect of the case.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) As regards the allegations concerning acts of violence by the police against strikers (national strike of July : four deaths and  injured; strike by workers of the Banco Inmobiliario on  April : seven injured; strike by workers in the Banco Nacional de Desarrollo on  April : five injured; and the strike in the Olof Palme Convention Centre on  April :  injured), the Committee regrets that it must once again ask the Government to open judicial inquiries with a view to elucidating the deaths of and injuries sustained by workers who participated in the strikes, identifying responsibilities and sanctioning the guilty parties, and to keep it informed of the outcome.(b) The Committee once again asks the Government to carry out judicial investigations with a view to elucidating the acts of violence which occurred during the collective dispute in the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS), when different persons sustained injuries, and to punish the guilty parties. The Committee asks the Government to inform it of the results of these investigations.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in February , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see st Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (March )). The Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) submitted new allegations and additional information in communications dated  March and  June .
.The Government sent further observations in communications dated  April,  May and  June .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations that remained pending at the Committee's meeting in February  referred to the following questions: the declaration of strikes as illegal and police repression against striking workers; the ban on trade union check-off; the dismissal of workers from the TELCOR and E. Chamorro enterprises and the refusal to recognise the legal personality of the latter enterprise's trade union; the alleged campaign of military and police repression against the trade union leaders of the Sandinista Workers' Confederation and, specifically, the legal proceedings against Mr. Antonio Somoza Samorio; the organisation, promotion and financing of pro-government trade unions; and the establishment of machinery for the control of customs administration staff.
.In its previous examination of the case, the Committee made the following recommendations (st Report, para. ):- ""the Committee requests the Government to state whether there has been compliance with the legal procedures for declaring strikes illegal as regards the strikes mentioned by the complainants, to state the specific reasons for declaring these strikes illegal, and to state whether judicial investigations have been instituted for the purposes of clarifying circumstances surrounding the death and injury of trade unionists participating in the strikes mentioned in the complainants' communications; the Committee emphasises the seriousness of these allegations and expresses its deep concern;- the Committee requests the Government to supply further information on the situation in the past and at present concerning the deduction of trade union dues at the source and to indicate the consequences upon the freedom of workers to choose their trade union organisation;- the Committee requests the Government to provide information concerning the reasons for the alleged dismissals of all workers and trade union leaders in the international communications department of the Telecommunications and Postal Service (TELCOR), who participated in the second national strike;- the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the recent allegations according to which  workers and trade union leaders have been dismissed from the E. Chamorro enterprise, the police repression of the meeting held to show solidarity with the dismissed workers, the refusal to recognise the legal personality of this enterprise trade union, and the campaign of military and police repression against the trade union leaders of the Sandinista Workers' Confederation, specifically as regards the legal proceedings against Mr. Antonio Somoza Samorio;- the Committee requests the complainant organisations to state which trade union organisations are alleged to have been organised and financed by the Government, to state on what facts these allegations are based, and to specify in detail the machinery used to control customs administration staff.""
.In its communication of  March , the CST alleges that on  March , army and police troops violently evicted workers from the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS), San Isidro branch, in the Department of Matagalpa. It points out that a demonstration of some , persons, including members of the general public, workers, students and peasants in the area, tried to protect the ENABAS workers; however, they were repressed by army and police forces. As a result of this repression,  persons were wounded and  workers arrested.
.In its communication of  June , the CST, replying to the request made by the Committee at its meeting in February  for information on the customs workers, states that on  March  police anti-riot squads were used to repress the workers striking in this sector. During the repression, the police forces particularly attacked Antonio Espinoza and Csar Armando Reyes (members of the trade union executive);  workers in the sector were arrested. As regards the organisation, promotion and financing of trade union organisations by the Government, the complainant states that during the TELCOR labour dispute, the new trade unions acted in accordance with the employer's point of view and that the Deputy Minister and the legal adviser of TELCOR participated directly in the setting up of these unions. In the case of the sugar mills (especially in the labour dispute involving the Germn Pomares mill), the CST states that the autonomous CTN, in collusion with the Ministry of the Interior, instigated a movement of strikebreakers to try and put down the strike called by the workers belonging to the Sandinista Workers' Confederation, causing a clash between both parties. As a result of this clash, one of the strikebreakers died; although the trade union officials belonging to the CTN were only detained for  hours, an order was issued to arrest and try",1,1991,Nicaragua
86,"Francisco Somoza, Secretary-General of the trade union belonging to the CST. Finally, the complainant points out that a letter sent to the Ministry of the Interior by Antonio Jarqun, Secretary-General of the autonomous CTN several days before the clash caused by these strikebreakers contained detailed information on the plans to be implemented. Finally, the complainant states that in a number of regions, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Labour use trade union officials belonging to trade unions affiliated to the Standing Workers' Congress to identify and control trade union officials belonging to other unions which organise strikes at the workplace. Providing a specific example, it refers to the communication from the Secretary-General of Proceedings and Agreements of the independent CGT, which gives the Minister of the Interior the names of the trade union officials responsible for the strikes in the CEMA institution; these officials have since been subjected to repression at work and have since been watched closely by the police.
.In its communication of  April , the Government points out that in October ,  workers from the ""Germn Pomares Ordoez"" sugar mill, belonging to the ""Ramn Salvatierra"" Sandinista Trade Union, declared a general strike and the sugar mill stopped operations. The Nicaraguan Workers' Confederation (CTN) and the Central for Trade Union Unity (CUS) agreed with the Director-General of the establishment to begin harvesting the sugar cane on  November. In a letter to the Minister of the Interior the Secretary-General of the CTN requested protection so that the workers might enter the sugar mill to work. The Government points out that on  November , the workers from the independent trade unions turned up at the mill to begin harvesting the sugar cane but found the entrance gates blocked and guarded by armed members of the Sandinista trade union. When the independent workers tried to take the barricades down, shots were fired at them; the outcome of this clash was the death of one worker and injury of five persons. Later, the Minister of the Interior ordered the arrest of those involved in the murder and responsible for the injuries caused. The police detained about ten members of the independent trade unions; however, workers from the trade union affiliated to the CST remained free, including Francisco Somoza, accused by colleagues of the dead worker of having been responsible for his death.
.In response to the Committee's request for information at its February  meeting, the Government states, in a communication dated  May , that by declaring the strikes illegal, it acted in accordance with the legislation and the principles of equity. It specifically points out that: the national disturbance in July  was declared illegal under a ministerial resolution which states that a number of workers in the public sector from several state-owned enterprises and union organisations affiliated to the National Workers Front (FNT), had continued to refuse to work and were occupying workplaces, resorted to violence to intimidate those who wanted to work, tried to prevent the development and success of the Government's economic, political and social programme and violated the legal proceedings and standards for settling economic and social disputes laid down in the Labour Code in force; the customs workers' strike on  March  was not declared illegal since the parties had reached an agreement without the intervention of the Ministry of Labour; the strikes of workers of the Banco Inmobiliario ( April ) and of the Banco Nacional de Desarrollo ( April ) were not declared illegal and there was an agreement between the Government and the Banking Federation; the strike of the workers of the Olaf Palme Convention Centre was declared illegal because work had been interrupted without exhausting the procedures laid down for settling economic and social collective disputes in the Labour Code (sections  to , which forbids, amongst other things, acts of violence). There was an appeal against the resolution, but it was upheld by the General Labour Inspectorate.
.As regards the trade union check-off, the Government states that in the past, payroll deductions of trade union dues amounted to a form of police control. The new ministerial resolution states that workers must give their approval before union dues are deducted from their pay; but the Government stresses that these deductions are in no way forbidden. The Government points out that there are collective agreements stipulating that the enterprise may deduct trade union dues from the salaries, provided that the members accept this in writing (Empresa Fotograbado y Litografa Prez, Alcada de Managua, etc.).
.As regards the alleged dismissals of all the workers and trade union leaders in the international telecommunications department of the Telecommunications and Postal Service (TELCOR), the Government points out that in September , the Department of Statistics was created within TELCOR, thus improving, with part of the staff, international communications; the rest of the staff were transferred to other priority areas within the enterprise. More specifically, of the  workers alleged to have been dismissed,  were placed in the Department of Statistics, nine profited from the occupational retraining programme and the other  were transferred to various areas within the enterprise.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of  workers and trade union officials in the E. Chamorro enterprise, the Government encloses a copy of the memorandum of agreement between the enterprise and the workers. Concerning the alleged police repression during the meeting of solidarity with the dismissed workers, the Government points out that the police were obliged to intervene in order to stop the violence sparked off by the strikers and persons outside the dispute, led by so-called trade union officials, and to maintain and re-establish public law and order. Concerning the refusal to grant legal personality to the trade union in this enterprise, the Government states that a request for registration of this trade union was submitted to the Trade Union Associations Department in October , but this had not been granted as the request contained various formal and substantial irregularities (the time of the founding documents was not mentioned; only five trade union secretaries had been elected, whereas, according to the association's by-laws, ten should have been elected; the name of the union ""Domingo Zambrano"" was only mentioned in pencil; most of the lists of the union's founders showed illegible signatures). In addition, the appeal against this resolution was out of time. A new request for registration was submitted later, but this was withdrawn by the trade union's legal adviser because two of the members of the trade union's executive had resigned from the enterprise.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government states, in connection with the events which allegedly occurred in the Empresa Nicaragense de Alimentos Bsicos (ENABAS), that on  August ,  workers from the enterprise occupied the premises and took over the administrative and financial control, deciding that the money obtained from the sale of the products in the warehouse would be used by the trade union to pay wages. The enterprise requested the termination of the employment contracts of the  workers; however, during the months of November and December, negotiations took place with the FNT and the CST resulting in the signing of two agreements and the handing back of the premises to the enterprise. The Government points out that on  January , the workers once again took over the premises; a further request was made to terminate the employment contracts and the corresponding criminal charges were made. On  and  March the police took control of the premises without arresting any worker and re-established order on the Pan-American Highway which was blocked, encountering resistance from some of the armed workers. Later, there were new attempts to take over the premises and barricades were once again set up on the highway; however, the police and army troops broke up the group. During this exercise  persons were arrested and two injured. Finally, the Government states that after these actions, no worker remained in detention and the various industrial proceedings between the enterprise and the workers are being conducted by the Labour Court of Daro City, the Municipal Court of San Isidro and the Matagalpa Departmental Labour Inspectorate.
.With respect to the allegations concerning the declaration of illegality for a number of strikes, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the strikes in the customs administration ( March ) and those in the Banco Inmobiliario and the Banco Nacional de Desarrollo ( and  April ) were not declared illegal and that an agreement had been reached between the parties. The Committee notes, however, that the national strike in July  and the strike in the Olaf Palme Convention Centre were declared illegal on the grounds of having violated the provisions of the Labour Code (sections  to ) pertaining to the settlement of collective labour disputes, because the strikers had carried out acts of violence. In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government did not give more details on these acts of violence",1,1991,Nicaragua
87,"and points out that final decisions concerning illegality of strikes should not be made by the Government - especially in those cases in which the Government is a party to the dispute. The Committee also regrets that the Government did not provide information concerning the allegations of police violence against the strikers (July : four deaths and  injured;  April : seven injured;  April : five injured; and  April :  injured). It requests the Government to give instructions for the carrying out of judicial investigations into the deaths incurred and injuries sustained by the workers taking part in the above-mentioned strikes and to keep it informed of developments.
.As regards the allegation concerning the banning by a ministerial resolution of the deduction of trade union dues, the Committee notes that the Government maintains that employers are allowed to check off trade union dues, provided that this has been expressly authorised by the worker. Nevertheless, the Committee recalls that paragraph  of the ministerial resolution states that ... ""henceforth, the deduction by employers in the state, mixed and private sectors, of any amount of money from workers' wages as trade union dues shall be forbidden, even if this has been agreed by any means whatsoever between the parties"". In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend this resolution so that its provisions are aligned with the practice described by the Government, and established through collective agreements.
.As regards the alleged dismissal of workers from the TELCOR enterprise, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these workers were not dismissed but transferred to other posts as a result of a restructuring within the enterprise. Furthermore, the Committee notes the act of agreement signed between the E. Chamorro enterprise and the trade union which put an end to the labour dispute over the dismissals in this enterprise. Similarly, as regards the alleged police repression against workers holding a meeting in support of the strikes in the E. Chamorro enterprise, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the police intervention was the outcome of acts of violence between the strikers and persons outside the dispute.
.As regards the refusal to grant legal personality to the ""Domingo Zambrano"" trade union in the E. Chamorro enterprise, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the first request for registration was refused by the Trade Union Associations Department of the Ministry of Labour because of various irregularities of form and of substance (the time of the founding documents was not mentioned; only five trade union secretaries had been elected, whereas, according to the association's by-laws, ten should have been elected; the name of the union ""Domingo Zambrano"" was only mentioned in pencil; most of the lists of the union's founders showed illegible signatures), and that a new request for registration was withdrawn by the trade union's legal adviser because two of the members of the executive had handed in their resignation to the enterprise. The Committee expresses the hope that if the trade union being set up submits a new request, fulfilling the legal requirements, it will be registered without delay on the register of trade union organisations.
.As regards the alleged army and police repression, on  March , against workers in the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS), San Isidro branch, Department of Matagalpa, which resulted in  persons being injured and  arrested, the Committee notes the Government's explanations - in particular that the police intervened on account of successive acts of violence, including the bearing of arms by workers and demonstrators, the blocking of the Pan-American Highway and the taking over of the enterprise's premises. It also notes that those detained were released soon after their arrest. In view of the fact that the Government only referred in its reply to the commencement of labour court proceedings, the Committee requests the Government to have judicial investigations carried out into the injuries that occurred (according to the complainant,  persons were injured - two according to the Government).
.As concerns the alleged campaign of military and police repression against the trade union leaders of the Sandinista Workers' Confederation and, in particular, the legal proceedings against Antonio Somoza Samorio, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that on  November, workers belonging to the independent trade unions tried to pull down the barricades erected by the workers belonging to the trade union affiliated to the Sandinista Federation and to enter the ""Germn Pomares Ordoez"" sugar mill. This resulted in an armed conflict and the death of one of the workers. The Committee notes that, according to the Government, Francisco Somoza is free, but it notes that the complainants allege that legal proceedings have been started against Mr. Somoza for the death of the worker in question. In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of this trial.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government failed to send its observations on the complainants' allegations and new information, dated  June , referring to the organisation, promotion and financing of pro-government trade unions, or on the police surveillance of a number of trade union officials (specifically, the trade union officials responsible for the strikes in the CEMA institution). The Committee requests the Government to reply as soon as possible to these allegations.
.Finally, the Committee observes that as regards the allegation that machinery was used to control customs administration staff, the trade union organisations have not supplied information on this issue, in spite of the request made by the Committee at its meeting in February .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee regrets that the Government did not provide information on the acts of police violence against the strikers, that had been alleged by the complainants (strikes of July : four deaths and  injured;  April : seven injured;  April : five injured; and  April :  injured). It requests the Government once again to inform the Committee if it has initiated judicial investigations with a view to elucidating the murders of and injuries sustained by the workers taking part in the above-mentioned strikes.(b) The Committee stresses that final decisions concerning the illegality of strikes should not be made by the Government, especially in those cases in which the Government is a party to the dispute.(c) The Committee requests the Government to take the necessary steps to amend, along the lines mentioned in the conclusions, the ministerial resolution concerning the prohibition of trade union check-off, so as to bring the legislation into conformity with the practice established through collective agreements.(d) The Committee expresses the hope that if the trade union ""Domingo Zambrano"" (being set up) within the E. Chamorro enterprise requests to be entered on the register of trade union organisations and fulfils the necessary legal requirements, that this will occur without any delay.(e) The Committee requests the Government to have judicial investigations carried out into the alleged injuries that were sustained by workers on  March  (according to the complainant,  persons were injured and, according to the Government, two) during the collective dispute which occurred in the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimiento de Granos Bsicos (ENABAS).(f) The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the criminal proceedings instigated against the trade union official Francisco Somoza, following the events which occurred in the ""Germn Pomares Ordoez"" sugar mill.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send, as soon as possible, its observations on the allegation referring to the organisation, promotion and financing of pro-government trade unions, and on the police surveillance of the trade union officials responsible for the strikes in the CEMA institution.
.The Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) and the National Union of Workers (UNE) presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua alleging the violation of trade union rights in a communication of  June . The CST submitted new allegations in communications of  October and  December , and the UNE submitted additional information in a communication of September . The Public Services International (PSI), in a communication of  July , endorsed the complaint. The Government sent its observations in communications of  October  and  January .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (CST) and the National Union of Workers (UNE) state that since the new Government headed by Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took office, there has been systematic and uninterrupted series of serious violations of international labour standards.
.The complainant organisations state that within only two weeks of its inauguration, the new Government promulgated Decree No. -, which suspended the Civil Service Act, and ordered the renegotiation of collective agreements in force throughout the country. The complainant organisations",1,1991,Nicaragua
88,"add that , public administration workers were dismissed and that collective agreements were arbitrarily suspended by virtue of this Decree. Likewise, the complainant organisations contend that the Government is insensitive to social issues, has left  per cent of the working age population unemployed and has caused deteriorations in basic social services (health and education).
.In this context, the complainants specifically allege that:(a) the Government has, through the Ministry of Labour, forced the renegotiation of collective agreements, although it has no legal power to do so, after having annulled the collective agreement for the National Social Security and Welfare Institute (INSSBI), and annulled and replaced the collective agreement for the Telecommunications and Postal Service (TELCOR);(b) the Government does not respect legislation regarding strikes, having declared illegal such strikes as have been called. Likewise, there has been police repression against striking workers in the following cases:- The national strike of July . Pro-Government shock troops attacked striking workers, leaving four dead and  injured.- The customs workers' strike of  March . Police forces attacked striking workers, injuring some and arresting others.- The strike of the workers of Banco Inmobiliaro, of  April . The police assaulted the striking workers and seriously wounded seven of them.- The strike of the workers of the Banco Nacional de Desarrollo, of  April . The police wounded five workers.- The strike of the workers of the OLOF PALME Convention Centre. Riot police squads assaulted striking workers, injuring  of them.(c) the Government has organised, promoted and financed pro-Government trade unions in the Ministry of Health, the INSSBI, the Telecommunications and Postal Service, the Ministry of Education, the National Financial System, and other agencies;(d) under a ministerial resolution of June , the Government banned payroll deductions of trade union dues, even where workers had agreed to such deductions and where agreements to this effect existed between trade unions and employers;(e) all workers and trade union leaders in the international communications department of the Telecommunications and Postal Service, who participated in the second national strike, have been removed, dismissed or transferred from their posts;(f) the three major leaders of the National Social Security Workers' Federation, Messrs. Oscar Vargas, Marvin Sovalbarro and Omar Miranda, were dismissed from the INSSBI for having denounced the personal use of institutional assets and property by the head of this Ministry.In its communication of  September , the UNE encloses documents in support of its allegations (first-hand accounts of the dismissal of trade union leaders, notices regarding the reinstatement of workers issued by the Ministry of Labour, etc.)..In its communication of  October , the CST states that in the first weeks of the month of October, workers in the E. Chamorro enterprise, located in Granada, set up a trade union. Subsequently, over  workers were dismissed from the enterprise, including all trade union leaders. The complainants add that on  October, while the workers of the enterprise were holding a meeting of solidarity with their dismissed colleagues, they were assaulted by special police forces; a number of workers were arrested and subsequently released. The CST also states that the Ministry of Labour refused to recognise the legal personality of the trade union owing to omissions and formal deficiencies in the minutes and by-laws submitted, in blatant disregard for the procedure provided for by law for the correction of formal deficiencies in documents of this kind. The complainant organisation also indicates that the Government directed the establishment of a supervisory mechanism covering all the Customs Department staff, and in particular union leaders.

The complainant organisation also indicates that the Government directed the establishment of a supervisory mechanism covering all the Customs Department staff, and in particular union leaders.
.Lastly, in its communication of  December , the CST states that the Government has for several months been conducting an intense and selective campaign of police and military repression against the Confederation's leaders, and has instituted unfounded legal proceedings against Mr. Antonio Somoza Samorio, the General Secretary of the Ramn Salvatierra trade union, which organises workers in the Ingenio Azucarero Germn Pomares Ordoez enterprise. He is charged with a common law crime (felonious homicide), as a result of events which transpired in connection with a trade union protest at the workplace.
.In a communication of  October , the Government states that the Government for National Reconciliation is based on democratic principles and the respect of human rights, including social and labour rights such as the right to strike, freedom of association, collective bargaining, etc. It adds that the National Workers' Front (FNT), which includes several Sandinista trade unions, is capitalising on the country's economic problems to manipulate the working class, and refers specifically to acts of violence which took place on  October, when the Ministry of Labour convened a meeting of the National Minimum Wage Commission (these events had no direct relation to the allegations).
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that the complainants' allegations concerning the infringement of the right to collective bargaining are completely false, since it was not until the third quarter of  that  collective agreements and nine wage agreements were negotiated and signed by several independent and Sandinista trade union organisations. It adds that, in accordance with Decree No. -, all collective agreements signed between  February and  April , in other words, during the period of transition from the Sandinista Government to the National Salvation Government, were revised for the purpose of ensuring that the economic prospects of various enterprises would not be jeopardised by highly onerous agreements whose political aim was to destabilise the country as the new Government assumed power in catastrophic economic conditions.
.As regards the collective agreement of the National Social Security and Welfare Institute (INSSBI), the Government states that it was signed in the period  February to  April ; in accordance with the ministerial resolution, it was subject to review and subsequently found not to comply with the administrative and legal provisions established in sections  and following of the Labour Code; moreover, it was determined that the individual who signed the agreement did not belong to the Conciliation Department, but had merely been appointed as a worker in the Trade Union Associations Department, and that the agreement was never filed with the Inspection Service, as required by law. Nevertheless, the Government points out that the rights acquired by the workers remained in force and are being applied by the Institution. As regards the Postal and Telecommunications Service (TELCOR) agreement, it was, like the INSSBI agreement, reviewed with the consent of several trade unions and the enterprise. The Government points out that the Sandinista trade union participated in several stages of the review, but refused to ratify the conclusions.
.As regards the right to strike, the Government states that its actions are consistent with the principles of a state of law, where every effort is made to guarantee that the parties to a dispute will find a solution which maintains a fair balance between their respective interests, and that it believes in and supports the right to work, the right to associate freely and the right to strike. The Government states that social agreements as well as bilateral talks between the Government and the opposition party, the Frente Sandinista, have called for a repudiation of violence and the strengthening of dialogue as a way of solving the problems faced by the country, but that the CST, which is affiliated to the FNT, fails to abide by these agreements and follows a policy which seeks to destabilise the Government, a policy of destruction and aggression, and that it is not engaged in the solution of trade union problems but has strictly political objectives.
.The Government reports that in Nicaragua, under the National Salvation Government, freedom of association is full and unrestricted, and that nothing in the law prevents workers from joining the trade union of their choice. Regarding the ministerial resolution of June , which refers to trade union contributions, the Government adds that this resolution aims at protecting workers by ensuring that compulsory contributions do not undermine freedom of association, while protecting the full freedom of workers to contribute to the",1,1991,Nicaragua
89,"trade union of their choice.
.Lastly, as regards the dismissals of trade unionists Oscar Vargas Ortiz, Omar Miranda Carrin and Marvin Sovalbarro Sandoval, of the INSSBI, the Government states that the Minister of Labour issued a resolution ordering that these workers be reinstated, and that the enterprise complied with this resolution by reinstating them to their previous posts, with the same responsibilities and remuneration.
.The Committee notes that the allegations presented by the complainant organisations refer to the following questions:(a) the mandatory renegotiation and annulment of collective agreements;(b) the declaration of strikes as illegal and police repression against striking workers;(c) the organisation, promotion and financing of pro-Government trade unions;(d) the ban on trade union check-off; and(e) the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in several enterprises.
.As regards the allegations concerning the mandatory renegotiation and annulment of existing collective agreements, the Committee notes that the Government states that the difficult social and economic situation in which the new Government assumed office led it to promulgate Decree No. -, which called for the review of collective agreements signed between  February and  April , the transitional period between the Sandinista Government and the National Salvation Government, for the purpose of ensuring that the economic prospects of various enterprises would not be jeopardised by highly onerous agreements; this review, however, did not extend to the agreed wage policy. Referring specifically to the collective agreements in the INSSBI and TELCOR, the Government states that both of these agreements were reviewed owing to the fact that they had been signed during the period mentioned in Decree No. -; the INSSBI agreement was annulled because it contained several anomalies, while the TELCOR agreement was modified with the consent of several trade unions, although these modifications were not ratified by the Sandinista trade union. In general, the Committee considers that legislation which requires the renegotiation of agreements in force is contrary to the principles of free and voluntary collective bargaining enshrined in Convention No. ; nevertheless, the Committee has taken full note of the fact that the circumstances of the case were clearly exceptional and that the agreements subject to renegotiation are those signed in the time of Government transition, and that trade unions were invited to participate in the renegotiation of these collective agreements; likewise, the Committee has taken note of the difficult social and economic situation then facing the country. The Committee considers, nevertheless, that the Government should have endeavoured to ensure that the renegotiation of collective agreements in force resulted from an agreement reached between the parties concerned.
.As regards the allegation that the Government has not followed legal procedures in declaring strikes illegal, and allegations concerning the illegal repression of striking workers, the Committee notes that the Government has merely stated in a general manner that the actions of Sandinista trade unions aim at strictly political ends, are designed to destabilise the Government, and do not seek solutions to trade union problems; the complainant organisations, for their part, have highlighted the country's difficult economic and social situation. The Committee regrets to note that the Government has not furnished specific information in its reply concerning the reasons which the complainants attribute to the Government for declaring strikes illegal, nor concerning the allegations of police repression in connection with the strikes of July  (which left four dead and  injured), the strike of  March , the strike of  April  (seven persons injured), the strike of  April  (five persons injured) and the strike of  April  ( workers injured). The Committee emphasises the seriousness of these allegations and expresses its deep concern. The Committee requests the Government to state whether it has complied with legal procedures, to clarify the specific reasons which led it to declare these strikes illegal and to state whether judicial investigations have been instituted for the purpose of clarifying the facts surrounding the reported death and injury of workers participating in these strikes.
.As regards the alleged organisation, promotion and financing of pro-Government trade unions, the Committee notes that the complainant organisations mention only the names of state agencies in which these trade unions are alleged to exist, without, however, identifying them by name, nor stating how the Government has promoted or financed them. Therefore, the Committee requests the complainant organisations to provide further information on this aspect of the case.
.As regards the ministerial resolution which prohibits employers from deducting trade union dues at the source, the Committee requests the Government to supply further information on the situation in the past and at present concerning the deduction of trade union dues at the source, and to indicate the consequences upon the freedom of workers to choose their trade union organisations.
.As regards the dismissal of workers and trade union leaders in several enterprises, the Committee notes that the Government has replied only to the allegations concerning the INSSBI, by stating that Messrs. Oscar Vargas Ortiz, Omar Miranda Carrin and Marvin Sovalbarro Sandoval have been reinstated to their previous posts, with the same responsibilities and remuneration. The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent information concerning the alleged dismissal of all workers and trade union leaders from the international communications department of the Telecommunications and Postal Service (TELCOR) who participated in the second national strike, and requests the Government to state the reasons for these dismissals. The Committee emphasises the principle according to which no worker should be dismissed or subjected to reprisals on the grounds of his or her trade union activities.
.As regards the allegation concerning the establishment of machinery for the control of customs workers, especially as regards trade union leaders, and the order which bars trade union meetings, the Committee requests the complainant organisations to supply more specific information and to indicate what type of machinery has been applied.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent observations on the allegations concerning the dismissal of  workers and trade union leaders from the E. Chamorro enterprise, the violent repression by police forces of the meeting held to demonstrate solidarity with workers who had been dismissed, the refusal to recognise the legal personality of this enterprise's trade union, and the alleged campaign of military and police repression against the trade union leaders of the Sandinista Workers' Confederation (specifically, the legal proceedings against Mr. Antonio Somoza Salorio, General Secretary of the Ramn Salvatierra trade union of the Ingenio Azucarero Germn Pomares Ordoez enterprise, for an alleged common law crime). The Committee notes that these are recent allegations and requests the Government to reply as soon as possible.
.In the light of the foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) The Committee requests the Government to state whether there has been compliance with the legal procedures for declaring strikes illegal as regards the strikes mentioned by the complainants, to state the specific reasons for declaring these strikes illegal, and to state whether judicial investigations have been instituted for the purposes of clarifying circumstances surrounding the death and injury of trade unionists participating in the strikes mentioned in the complainants' communications; the Committee emphasises the seriousness of these allegations and expresses its deep concern.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply further information on the situation in the past and at present concerning the deduction of trade union dues at the source and to indicate the consequences upon the freedom of workers to choose their trade union organisations.(c) The Committee requests the Government to provide information concerning the reasons for the alleged dismissal of all workers and trade union leaders in the international communications department of the Telecommunications and Postal Service (TELCOR), who participated in the second national strike.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the recent allegations according to which  workers and trade union leaders have been dismissed from the E. Chamorro enterprise, the police repression of the meeting held to show solidarity with the dismissed workers, the refusal to recognise the legal personality of this enterprise trade union, and the campaign of military and police repression against the trade union leaders of the Sandinista Workers' Confederation, specifically as regards the legal proceedings against Mr. Antonio Somoza Samorio.(e) The Committee requests the complainant organisations to state which trade union organisations are alleged to have been organised and financed by the Government, to state on what facts these allegations are based, and to specify in detail the machinery used to control customs administration staff.(f) Whilst noting that the circumstances of the case were clearly exceptional and that trade unions were invited to participate in the renegotiation of the collective agreements in force, the Committee nevertheless considers that the Government should have endeavoured to ensure that the renegotiation resulted from an agreement between the parties concerned.",1,1991,Nicaragua
90,".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, alleging infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has examined these matters on several occasions, in particular in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot in September-October  by a study mission, and in February and May  (see th and th Reports, approved by the Governing Body at its nd and rd Sessions (February-March and May  respectively)).
.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted further information in communications dated  June and  August . The Government supplied information in communications dated  June and  and  October .
.During its examination of the cases in May , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:(a) As regards the drafting of a new Labour Code, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations are still being held with employers' and workers' organisations, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. Noting with concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted by the Government, the Committee requests the Government to hear the views of this organisation and to send rapidly an assistance request to the Office. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code, while expressing the firm hope that all the opinions expressed by the employers' and workers' organisations will be taken into account, without exception.(b) Concerning the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that a new Act on communications media has been adopted. It notes with regret that the Ministry of the Interior retains the power to impose temporary suspensions on the media. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the decrees violating freedom of speech in economic matters, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.(c) With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a meeting concerning the agricultural sector has taken place and that such a meeting will be organised in the near future for the industrial sector. The Committee asks the Government to indicate whether the COSEP was invited to these meetings as an employers' organisation. The Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing tripartite consultations commission on international labour standards, composed of all workers' and employers' organisations without exception. It requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in that respect.(d) As regards the detentions, the Committee notes with interest that Messrs. Alegra, Quant and several CUS trade unionists have been released. The Committee deplores that these persons have been detained for long periods and expresses the hope that they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in conformity with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the arrest on  June  of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, and on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza.(f) The Committee once more requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged detention of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.(g) Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November Session the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.
.In its communication dated  June , the IOE alleges that, following a meeting held two days earlier by the Association of Coffee Producers of Nicaragua (UNCAFENIC), affiliated to COSEP, at which the policy of the Coffee Committee, an official body, was seriously challenged, the Government decided on the immediate expropriation of the land owned by the Association's President, A. Alemn Lacayo, and by N. Bolaos Geyer and J. Cuadra Sommabira, officials of UNCAFENIC and of the Association of Coffee Producers of Magalpa, the town where the meeting was held. The officials were accused by the Government of refusing to negotiate and of encouraging anarchy, confrontation and the breakdown of negotiations. In fact, UNCAFENIC is in total disagreement with an economic policy that is being imposed on it through so-called negotiations and is making its opinion known to its members, which is the role and the right of an employers' organisation.
.In the view of the IOE, the expropriation is very much in the spirit of similar measures that have been brought to the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association on numerous occasions, which are designed to intimidate and muzzle the leaders of COSEP and of one of its principal members, the Union of Agricultural Producers of Nicaragua (UPANIC).
.The IOE mentions another instance of arbitrary confiscation of land belonging to a COSEP leader that was ordered as a reprisal after COSEP criticised the Government's economic policy. The day after the holding of a meeting on  July  in Estelli to prepare COSEP's General Assembly, the Government confiscated the land of the President and host of the preparatory meeting, Jos Mara Briones.
.The IOE recalls that the President of the Republic announced in a statement on  January  that no more land would be confiscated. According to the IOE, the fact that the Government has gone back on these recent undertakings, as it has done so often in the past, should at last convince the Committee that the Government is pursuing its discriminatory policy, is endeavouring to destabilise COSEP and is accordingly continuing to attack its leaders systematically.
.In its communication dated  August  the IOE submits a number of comments on the earlier replies - or lack of replies - from the Government. The IOE believes that the Government is attempting to pass off a number of measures it claims to have taken as a policy of consultation and negotiation with the social partners, including in the areas coming within the purview of the ILO. The Government's statements to this effect are misleading, if not downright untruths: either the measures were never taken by the Government or never involved COSEP or its members as such, or else they were taken in very different circumstances from those suggested by the Government. The IOE cites a number of examples.
.According to the IOE, for instance, the national tripartite consultations in the agricultural sector that are presented as tangible evidence of negotiation involved neither COSEP nor UPANIC, a member of COSEP, as such, but were held with people hand-picked by the Government from among the members of COSEP and UPANIC. Neither COSEP nor UPANIC, as such, were able to have their views represented.
.The IOE goes on to state that, when these organisations got together as best they could to discuss how to put across their points of view, which happened to disagree with the Government's economic policy,",0,1988,Nicaragua
91,"they were accused of economic sabotage, their leaders had their land expropriated and at the same time those who indicated their intention to withdraw from consultations in these circumstances were threatened with expropriation by the Minister for Agrarian Reform and by the President of the Republic himself. Thus the so-called consultations were turned into ""compulsory meetings"" conducted under the threat of sanctions.
.The Government has tried to show Mr. Gurdian, Vice-President of COSEP and President of UPANIC, as being in favour of the kind of consultations described above. However, Mr. Gurdian's opinion is perhaps better expressed by himself and by UPANIC: in a statement to La Prensa Mr. Gurdian said: ""These are not consultations at all but a form of blackmail that has frightened those who have been convened by the Government"".
.The IOE adds that it was the ILO, not the Government, that organised - and prepared with the Minister of Labour well in advance - the consultations that were held on  to  May  on the revision of Convention No. . At the request of the ILO, the Government sent a letter of invitation dated Tuesday,  May, that was delivered directly to COSEP on Friday,  May, at . p.m., leaving it barely  hours to find an expert by Monday,  May, to take part in the discussion of a highly specialised and controversial issue, which, as it turned out, it was unable to do.
.The national tripartite consultation for the industrial sector announced by the Government for May never took place and was apparently replaced by the creation of an Advisory Committee for Industry on which members of the Chamber of Industry were invited by the Government to sit in an individual capacity.
.According to the IOE, the meetings for the industrial sector and those for the agricultural sector were devoted essentially to the desperate economic situation of the country and of enterprises in general. The issues still pending between the ILO and Nicaragua, such as enjoyment of freedom of association, freedom of assembly and freedom to negotiate, were never raised. The meetings are only tripartite in name, since none of the trade unions which rival the official trade unions - the Sandinista Confederation of Workers (CST) and the Association of Rural Workers (ATC) - are invited and, as the discussions revolve essentially around economic issues, even the participation of the two official federations is purely symbolic, their presence being announced but virtually ignored.
.Regarding the reform of labour legislation and specifically the discussion and approval of the new Labour Code, the Government claims for the second time that consultations have begun and are continuing to advance with COSEP, pointing by way of proof to the holding of several seminars on the subject in April . On this point, the IOE states that there were exactly three meetings between January and May that COSEP was invited by the Government to attend:- one ostensibly tripartite meeting on labour inspection to which COSEP was invited ten minutes before the meeting started without being told what aspect of labour inspection was being discussed. At such short notice, COSEP was not able to attend or to put the employers' point of view;- a tripartite meeting on vocational training and employment creation, organised by the ILO and not by the Government;- a meeting, likewise organised by the ILO in Nicaragua (and in a whole series of other countries) and not by the Government, in connection with the second discussion of the revision of Convention No.  at the th Session of the International Labour Conference. Again, the notice it received was too short for COSEP to be represented.In all three cases the amendment of the labour legislation and the drafting of a new Labour Code was neither discussed nor on the agenda. COSEP therefore asserts once again that it was never consulted either by the National Assembly or by the Minister of Labour on the reform or amendment of labour legislation or the approval of a new Labour Code..The IOE notes that the Government has ignored the Committee's insistence, based largely on the observations of the  study mission, that legislation on judicial safeguards be adopted as soon as possible and has not supplied the information that was requested on the subject. It also observes that the Government has not responded to the hope expressed on several occasions by the Committee that it will compensate those who have been unfairly dispossessed of their land. The IOE cites an instance of pure and simple refusal to compensate one of the leaders of COSEP who was recently dispossessed, as well as the Government's refusal to hand over several farms whose confiscation was annulled by the Supreme Court. Other requests for compensation for the confiscation of land are still pending - and it cites the cases of Mr. Aleman, Mr. Bolaos and Mr. Cuadra. The IOE also considers that the Government has not supplied the information that was requested on the scope of the amnesty declared in February . In point of fact, the Government merely issued pardons, which are a considerably less lenient type of measure. The IOE wishes to know whether the proceedings instituted against employer and worker leaders who were summarily sentenced and then released are still before the courts and, if not, whether a pardon extinguishes the court proceedings and means that the sentence handed down by the lower court remains on the record.

.The IOE goes on to state that the Government is incapable of producing any convocation or agenda that it might have sent to COSEP or even the minutes of any meeting that COSEP might have attended, specifically with respect to the past or future discussion of the many important reforms which the Government promised the study mission would be made to the country's labour legislation and which the Committee on Freedom of Association or the Committee of Experts have been calling for each year for many years. The IOE challenges the Government to produce proof of its assertion that COSEP was consulted by the committee set up by the National Assembly to draft the new Labour Code. The IOE also maintains that the tripartite round table which the Government had promised in August-September  would be held very shortly has never been convened.
.In conclusion, the IOE considers that there have been so many shortcomings and inaccurate statements that only an impartial commission of inquiry could establish what the real situation is and whether or not the allegations of the complainants and the Government's replies are true.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government calls for technical and economic assistance in holding tripartite seminars and other similar forms of consultation in order to achieve its objective of reforming the Labour Code. According to the Government, this request is undeniable proof of the authorities' spirit of co-operation and firm intention to respond to the Committee's comments.
.In its letter of  October , the Government states that in accordance with the agreements signed between the President of the Republic and representatives of the legally constituted political parties, the National Assembly has had a very heavy agenda. It approved a Decree pardoning  persons who had been found guilty and were imprisoned for infringing the Act respecting the maintenance of public order and safety; it amended the Act respecting the media by entrusting the Supreme Electoral Council with the enforcement of this legislation and of the regulations issued thereunder in respect of problems connected with electoral law. The Assembly also approved amendments to the Act in respect of the judicial powers of the Sandinista police whereby",0,1988,Nicaragua
92,"all such judicial functions (trials and sentencing) are suspended, the police now being competent only in respect of investigations into and penalties in respect of offences committed by its own members. The Act is now referred to as the Sandinista Police Functions Act. The Assembly also unanimously approved an Act to amend Decree No.  (Act respecting the maintenance of public order and safety). According to this new Act, all the provisions in the Penal Code concerning rebellion, sedition and treason, which were covered by Decree No. , remain in force in the Penal Code. All offences stipulated in the Decree will therefore be punishable under the Penal Code. Lastly, the Assembly is giving priority consideration to an Act in respect of non-military national service presented by the Democratic Conservative Party.
.Because of its heavy schedule, as well as by the agreements reached in Tela (Honduras) by the Central American Heads of State, the plenary of the National Assembly has not yet been able to study the reforms to the labour legislation. Nevertheless, it is still the Government's intention to amend this legislation to bring it into line with ILO Conventions.
.The Government recalls that in accordance with the Costa del Sol (El Salvador) agreement of  February , it undertook to organise elections for the Presidency, the National Assembly and the Central American Parliament before  February  and to invite international observers, in particular from the United Nations (UNO) and the Organisation of American States (OAS), to see that the elections are held freely. The electoral process has now entered its second stage with the massive arrival of international observers including, for short periods, the Secretary-General of the OAS. A number of candidatures have been put forward for the Presidency. The Government states in this respect that Mr. Bolaos Gayer, honourary chairman of COSEP, wished to stand as the candidate for the National Union of the Opposition but was defeated. On that occasion, the COSEP made public appeals to vote. At the moment, the electoral lists are being drawn up.
.Following the Tela agreement of  August , signed by the Central American Heads of State, a joint plan was drawn up for the demobilisation, repatriation or voluntary settlement in Nicaragua and other countries of members of the Nicaraguan resistance and their families. To implement the plan, the International Support and Verification Commission (CIAV) was set up and the general secretaries of the UNO and the OAS were invited to participate. The Government and the CIAV are in direct contact with the resistance movement in order to promote the repatriation or resettlement of its members and their integration in the political process. Former resistance leaders have submitted their candidature for the coming parliamentary elections and one of them for the Presidency.
.According to the Government, all this shows the intense activity being carried out in Nicaragua for the benefit of all citizens without distinction. These activities will lead to the restoration, once and for all, of peace and the stabilisation of the economy. The new Government will then be able to embark on plans to raise the standard of living.
.For the Government, the measures thus adopted also meet a number of concerns expressed by the Committee. Thus the rescinding of the Act respecting the maintenance of public order and safety and the amendments to the Act respecting the judicial powers of the Sandinista police respond to the recommendation concerning the early adoption of legislation fully guaranteeing the exercise of public freedom and judicial safeguards. The same applies to the amnesty measures adopted by the National Assembly.
.According to the Government, in view of all these factors and since, because of the forthcoming elections, there are already international observers in the country from governmental, non-governmental and humanitarian organisations, the Government considers that this is not the time to send a commission of inquiry, which might be used politically, thus diverting it from its real purpose. Moreover, because there is full freedom of association, of expression and of movement, the Government does not consider it necessary to set up a commission of inquiry which would reach conclusions that are obvious and internationally known. Besides, this would involve the Organisation in unnecessary expense.
.In its communication of  October , the Government transmits the text of a resolution adopted on  October  by the European Parliament on the Tela meeting of Central American Heads of State and the Nicaraguan elections. In this resolution, the European Parliament expresses its satisfaction that the electoral process has been set in motion in Nicaragua and hopes that the  February  elections will offer to all political parties every guarantee of freedom, honesty and equal access to information media.
.The Committee has carefully examined the developments which have taken place in this matter since its meeting in May . However, it has not been able to take account of communications from the Government dated  October and  November , nor of a communication from the IOE dated  November  which arrived too late to allow a thorough examination of them.
.The Committee notes that the Government's communications of  June and  October  show that the Government has taken some positive measures along the lines of the recommendations previously made by the Committee, in particular the organisation of a tripartite seminar under the auspices of the ILO and the adoption of an amnesty decree in favour of persons sentenced for infringing the Act on the maintenance of public order and safety.
.Nevertheless, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied replies to some of the questions put by the Committee at its previous meeting, in particular in relation to the establishment of a standing committee on tripartite consultations concerning international labour standards and in relation to certain decrees violating freedom of economic information. In addition, the Government has not replied to the allegations made by the IOE in June and August  concerning the confiscation of land belonging to employers' leaders and the refusal to pay compensation and to restore farms to their owners. It also appears that, for a number of points at issue, contradictions still remain between the statements made by the complainants and by the Government, particularly regarding consultations on the preparation of the new Labour Code.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body that it transmit this affair as a whole to a commission of inquiry for examination, in conformity with article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the ILO. In making this recommendation, the Committee in no way is prejudging the situation in Nicaragua and even less is attributing blame to or expressing condemnation of the Government. On the contrary, it is convinced that the establishment of this commission will enable, in collaboration with the authorities and the social partners, a positive contribution to be made to solving the issues facing this country in the field of labour and industrial relations, issues which the Government has, on several occasions, stated that it wishes to resolve.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented in virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, of infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has examined these questions on several occasions, including in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot in September-October , and in February  (see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March )).
.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted new allegations in communications of  April and  May",0,1988,Nicaragua
93,". The Government supplied its observations in communications dated , ,  and  .
.During its examination of the cases in February-March , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:a) As regards the legislative aspect of the cases, the Committee notes that the Government is preparing the amendment of certain legislative provisions and that four draft Labour Codes will be discussed by the National Assembly during the next sitting of Parliament. The Committee recalls the urgent need for the adoption of new labour legislation in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  and the importance of involving all the workers' and employers' organisations, as well as the ILO, in its elaboration.b) As regards the exercise of civil liberties and judicial safeguards, the Committee impresses upon the Government that legislation fully guaranteeing these liberties and broadening the legal safeguards should be adopted as soon as possible, and it requests the Government to supply information on the measures it intends to take in this regard.c) As regards tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special commission which will examine questions linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . It requests the Government to supply specific information on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.d) As regards the confiscation of land, the Committee again expresses the hope that the Government will reopen the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossesed.e) With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these have now resumed but must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media. It recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.f) Regarding the detention of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations, the Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad amnesty in the coming days. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. It also notes the Government's statement that the file of Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.g) Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of States of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.h) The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these Accords will be able to be implemented in the shortest possible time and that their application will have favourable and immediate repercussions on the observance of the Conventions on freedom of association both in fact and in law. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the measures which the Government has to take to ensure this application should cover the elaboration and adoption of a new labour code as well as legislation guaranteeing fully the exercise of civil liberties. They should also cover the release of the leaders of employers' and workers' organisations to which the Committee attaches special importance. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply, as rapidly as possible, precise, concrete and detailed information on the measures that will be taken in this respect. In the meantime, the Committee invites the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take the appropriate preparatory measures so that the Governing Body will have before it, at its next session, proposals concerning the composition of a commission of inquiry and concerning the financial arrangements necessary for the work of this commission in the event that the Committee and the Governing Body consider the information supplied by the Government to be unsatisfactory and the Governing Body consequently decides to establish such a commission.
.In its communication of  April , the IOE states that the Government, contrary to its declarations, has never consulted, let alone advised the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP) about the legislative reform it is allegedly preparing. According to the IOE, these statements are made to deceive the ILO and international public opinion.
.The IOE adds that the National Assembly never consulted the COSEP on the Labour Code revision, or on any other legislation. Furthermore, the Minister of Labour did not consult the COSEP about the establishment of an institutional consultative body. The IOE explains that early in , several ministries - but not the Ministry of Labour - contacted certain organisations that are members of the COSEP with a view to discussing the economic recovery of the country. These occasional contacts, which have not been followed up let alone formalised, cannot in any way be regarded as constituting the establishment of a joint consultative body mandated to discuss social problems.
.The IOE also mentions that the Government, contrary to the assurances given in March  to the Committee on Freedom of Association, has not established a special tripartite consultative commission.
.The IOE adds that as of the date of its communication, neither Mr. Alegra, director of the Nicaraguan Institute of Economic and Social Studies (INIESEP) which reports to the COSEP, nor Mr. Quant, Vice-Chairman of the Chamber of Industry, charged with espionage and sentenced to a -year gaol term, have been released.
.Finally, the IOE considers that the amnesty which is part of the Accords concluded by the Central American Heads of State had no positive influence on the matters submitted to the Committee. According to the IOE, no detained employer or worker leader has so far benefited from this amnesty which has in fact been reduced to a pardon - a far less clement measure.
.The IOE concludes by stating that all these facts prove that it is necessary to constitute a commission of inquiry with a view to establishing on an impartial basis the real situation with respect to freedom of association and to the compliance of commitments accepted by Nicaragua through ratification of Conventions Nos. ,  and . The IOE attaches to its communication a declaration signed by the presidents of international and national employers' organisations in support of its complaint against the Government of Nicaragua.
.In its communication of  May , the IOE announces the release of Mr. Alegra, declared not guilty by the Managua Court of Appeal on  April . The IOE points out that at the time of his arrest and during his  months' imprisonment, Mr. Alegra did not enjoy the civil rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Without these rights, union rights are devoid of any real meaning, as recalled by the ILO resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil rights, adopted by the International Labour Conference in .
.The IOE underlines that, in addition to Mr. Alegra's arrest and arbitrary detention which violated the COSEP and INIESEP freedom of speech, Mr. Alegra was denied the right to a fair trial until his final acquittal. The IOE recalls in this respect that unspecified documents belonging to the INIESEP were confiscated by the prosecution which intended to use them, that Mr. Alegra has been obliged to make televised statements potentially damaging to his case, and that the Court of Appeal substantially exceeded the delays permitted by the Code of Criminal Procedure, i.e. ten months instead of six. The IOE considers that, in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article .), which binds Nicaragua, the COSEP, the INIESEP and Mr. Alegra are entitled to be compensated for the moral and material prejudice they have incurred, which was made even worse by the publicity given to the initial judgement, both at the national and international level.
.The IOE further states that the Legislative Assembly of Nicaragua has adopted on  April  a new Act on communications media, which embodies a series of principles proclaiming the freedom of the press. The IOE adds the Nicaraguan Constitution of  already enshrined a complete freedom of information that the Sandinist regime did not respect in practice, which is illustrated by the number of radio programmes closed as recently as a few weeks ago, by the fact that the COSEP was not permitted to launch an independent television channel, and by the censorship, the closings and the threats imposed upon the daily newspaper La Prensa. As regards the new Act, the IOE deplores the fact that Chapters",-1,1988,Nicaragua
94,"VIII to XI include provisions enabling the Ministry of the Interior to admonish and order the temporary closing of communications media in a series of circumstances so vaguely defined that all abuses of the recent past could be repeated. The IOE adds that this Act does not modify Decree No.  of  which, combined with Decree No.  of , grants the monopoly of economic data publication to a state body, namely the Nicaraguan Institute of Statistics and Enumeration. According to the IOE, these two decrees constitute a breach of freedom of information in Nicaragua, and especially a violation of the INIESEP's and COSEP's right to inform their members and the general public.
.In its communication of  May , the Government announces that Mr. Alegra was released on  April . Furthermore, the competent committee of the National Assembly has approved a pardon in the case of Mr. Guillermo Quant. This case will be submitted to the plenary assembly on  May.
.In its communication of  May , the Government confirms the release of Mr. Mario Alegra, pursuant to the judgement issued by the Criminal Chamber of the Appeals Court of Managua. It adds that on  May , the National Assembly approved the pardon granted to Mr. Guillermo Quant, a COSEP member who had been convicted for a documented and proven breach of the country's laws. Accordingly, Mr. Quant has also been released.
.The Government further announces the liberation, on  March , of  persons who are allegedly members of the Central Organisation of Unions (CUS), namely: Santos Francisco Garca Cruz, Juan Ramon Gutierrez Lopez, Saturnino Gutierriez Lopez, Juan Alberto Corteras Nuos, Presentacon Muoz Martnez, Ronal Gonzlez Lopez, Arnulfo Gonzalez Olivas, Jacinto Oliva Vallecillo, Salsmn de Jess Vallecillo Martnez, Ricardo Gutierrez Corteras Luis Enrique Garcia Alvarado, Euselio Garca Alvarado, Eduardo Garca Alvarado and Pedro Joaqun Talavera Perez.
.As regards Anastasio Gimenes Maldonado, Justino Rivera, Eva Gonzles and Eliazar Marenco, who were allegedly arrested in , the Government states it is still waiting the complementary information that the Committee had requested from the complainant organisation - i.e. the WCL - on the motives and circumstances surrounding these alleged arrests, in order to adequately follow up these complaints.
.With respect to tripartite consultations, the Government states that certain doubts arose about the viability of a system of a national tripartite consultative commission. According to the Government, all the indications are that tripartite consultations on international labour Conventions and on themes of interest to employers' and workers' organisations are more productive when they are held by sector of activity, or when they focus on specific issues previously identified. For that purpose, the President of the Republic organised during the first half of April a tripartite national consultation in the agricultural sector, with the participation of producers affiliated to COSEP and UNAG and of unions representing workers in this branch of activity. This meeting produced tangible results through the adoption of positive measures for private entrepreneurs: credit policies, tax incentives, government subsidies and marketing of farm products. On the other hand, the employers undertook to respect the workers' rights recognised in the legislation and the collective agreements. The major employer leaders welcomed these results, as established by the statements of Messrs. Gurdian and Dreyfus, leaders of the COSEP. The Government adds that a national tripartite consultation for the industrial sector is planned in May.
.Furthermore, in view of the coming discussion on the revision of Convention No.  on indigenous populations at the International Labour Conference, the Government has organised a national tripartite seminar on this theme, where it invited the COSEP, the UNAG and the most representative workers' organisations. Unfortunately, the COSEP did not participate in the seminar in spite of that invitation.
.As regards the reform and modifications of the labour legislation, and in particular the discussion and adoption of the new Labour Code, the Government states that the process of consultation with workers' and employers' organisations continued and improved, as evidenced by several tripartite seminars held on this theme in April. This consultative process is complex since the various central workers' organisations, which are the tangible expression of union pluralism in the country, are trying to find a consensus which would permit joint initiatives with a view to amending the legislation.
.The Government also indicates that, in view of the agreement concluded at the Summit of the Central American Heads of State on  February , the National Assembly had to debate on a priority basis, during the first months of , the Acts guaranteeing and demonstrating the Government's will to implement the compromises it had accepted as part of the peace initiative in Central America. The Elections Act and the Communications Media Act have thus been reformed. The Government adds that the discussion and adoption of the Labour Code remains a priority on the National Assembly agenda and that the ILO's technical assistance will be requested in due course.
.In conclusion, the Government hopes that this information will enable the Committee objectively to evaluate the efforts it is making to apply the international labour Conventions and to guarantee the rights and claims of employers and workers.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government declares, in response to the most recent allegations made by the IOE, that the fact that the Court of Appeal overturned the judgement of the lower court is additional evidence of the separation of powers in Nicaragua and of the judiciary's independence. The delays incurred before the Court of Appeal issued its judgement probably result from a backlog of work, as happens in other countries. As regards Mr. Alegra's compensation, it is for the courts - not the Committee on Freedom of Association - to decide that point, at the request of the interested party.
.Concerning the general legislation on communications media, the Government reaffirms that this Act has been passed by the Legislative Assembly, where various political parties with differing ideologies are represented. Furthermore, several independent institutes have compared this Act with those of other Latin American countries and found it more liberal.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government mentions that it is facing obstacles in the process of dialogue and consultations it wants to pursue. According to the Government, certain sectors clearly intend to annihilate the efforts it made to redress the country's economy, and want to prevent any possibility of real consultations in the political and economic fields. The Government refers more specifically to the COSEP's attitude which it terms as totally inflexible. The Government explains that the President of the Republic has invited the private sector to take joint steps with it so as to obtain financial resources from the international community. The COSEP then published a press release in which it did not authorise the private sector to participate in joint missions with the Government, which is contrary to the tripartism philosophy it claims to be supporting. Furthermore, the COSEP has excluded employer leaders who had participated in such missions. This inflexible attitude has also led the COSEP not to participate in the consultations on international labour standards (the Government attaches a copy of the letter sent to the COSEP on  May , inviting it to the meeting of  and  May  concerning the revision of Convention No. ). The Government concludes by asking the Committee to note the difference between its attitude and that of the COSEP.
.The Committee notes the replies given by the Government to the various recommendations and information requests made at its February  meeting.
.As regards the legislative aspect of the cases referred to it, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations continue with employers and workers organisations with a view to drafting a new Labour Code, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. The Committee must recall in this respect that the Committee of Experts, in its  observations on the application of Conventions Nos.  and , commented on certain labour legislation provisions which are not compatib with the Conventions, especially those dealing with the following questions: establishment of unions, control of union books and registers, right to strike and collective agreements. Given the significance of these issues for freedom of association and in view of the fact that these observations have been made for several years, the Committee must insist once again on the urgent need for legislation which is compatible with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee expresses its concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted about the revision of the Labour Code. The Committee requests the Government to hear the representations made by the COSEP on this matter. It firmly hopes that consultations will be successfully held with all the employers' and workers' organisations and that the Government will take into account the opinions expressed by these organisations, without exception. Furthermore, although the Government declared it would consult the ILO in due course, the Committee deplores that no such official request for assistance has been forthcoming as yet. Therefore, it",0,1988,Nicaragua
95,"asks the Government quickly to present such a request to the Office, so that the debate and adoption procedures of the Code may be completed as soon as possible, and that the final text be compatible with Conventions Nos.  and  ratified by Nicaragua. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code.
.As regards the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that the National Assembly has passed a new Act on communications media. While observing that this legislation would now preclude a permanent suspension of press media, the Committee must note with regret that the Ministry of the Interior keeps its power to impose temporary suspensions (three editions in the case of the press, four days for radio and three days for television), notably for second and subsequent violations of the Act. In addition, the Committee requests the Government to provide details on the decrees repealed by this Act; it requests the Government to indicate in particular whether previous decrees violating freedom of speech in the economic field, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.
.With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a national meeting was held in the agricultural sector, and that another such meeting will be held in the near future for the industrial sector. However, it is not clear from the Government's reply whether the employers that are members of the COSEP have been invited on an individual basis to that meeting, or if that invitation was extended to the organisation in its own right. The Committee asks the Government to clarify this point. As regards tripartite consultations held in the country with respect to international labour standards, the Committee notes that the Government organised a meeting concerning the revision of Convention No. . However, it must note that the invitation extended to the COSEP for that meeting was sent very late. The Committee insists that a global consultation policy on international labour standards should be established. In this respect, the Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing commission comprised of all employers' and workers' organisations, without exception, which could meet regularly. The Committee requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.Regarding the allegations of detentions, the Committee notes with interest the release of Messrs. Alegra and Quant, employer leaders, and of several CUS unionists charged with violations of the Act on security and on the maintenance of public order. The Committee can only regret that these persons were detained for long periods. It hopes they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in accordance with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee further notes that the Government did not provide information on the arrest, on  June , of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, namely: Luis Alfaro Centeno, Pastor Garca Matey, Mariano Romero Melgare, Dmaso Gonzlez Sanchez, Jess Cardenas Ordonez, Teodoro Matey Romero (held in detention at San Juan Rio Coco), Jos Matey Owonez and Rafael Ordonez Melgara (detained at La Dalla) and Miguel Valdina of the Union of Agricultural Workers of Posoltega. The Government also failed to provide information on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza, leaders of the National Bus Company Union, who had been convicted for sabotage and sentenced to five and six years' imprisonment respectively.
.As regards the alleged detention of Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Justino Rivera, Eva Gonzlez and Eleazar Marenco, the Committee once more requests the World Confederation of Labour to provide information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest of these persons.
.Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November meeting the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) As regards the drafting of a new Labour Code, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations are still being held with employers' and workers' organisations, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. Noting with concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted by the Government, the Committee requests the Government to hear the views of this organisation and to send rapidly an assistance request to the Office. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code, while expressing the firm hope that all the opinions expressed by the employers' and workers' organisations will be taken into account, without exception.b) Concerning the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that a new Act on communications media has been adopted. It notes with regret that the Ministry of the Interior retains the power to impose temporary suspensions on the media. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the decrees violating freedom of speech in economic matters, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.c) With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a meeting concerning the agricultural sector has taken place and that such a meeting will be organised in the near future for the industrial sector. The Committee asks the Government to indicate whether the COSEP was invited to these meetings as an employers' organisation. The Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing tripartite consultations commission on international labour standards, composed of all workers' and employers' organisations without exception. It requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in that respect.d) As regards the detentions, the Committee notes with interest that Messrs. Alegra, Quant and several CUS trade unionists have been released. The Committee deplores that these persons have been detained for long periods and expresses the hope that they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in conformity with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.e) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the arrest on  June  of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, mentioned above in paragraph , and on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza.f) The Committee requests once more the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged detention of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.g) Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November Session the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented in virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the",0,1988,Nicaragua
96,"right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, of infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has examined these questions on several occasions, most recently in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot from  September to  October  by a study mission conducted by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted new allegations in communications of  December  and  January . The Government supplied its observations in communications dated  January and , , ,  and  February .
.In its communication of  December , the IOE alleges that on  October  the Ministry of the Interior banned, for an unlimited period, the radio programme broadcast on Radio Mundial by the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), entitled ""The Nicaraguan"". According to the IOE, this programme reviews the main features of the economic and social situation of the country and suggests possible solutions in which the COSEP and its members would like to co-operate.
.Moreover, the IOE notes that on  November , also by order of the Ministry of the Interior, the programme ""Seis en Punto"" broadcast by Radio Corporacin was banned indefinitely. The IOE points out that the Director of Radio Corporacin and of the banned programme is Mr. Jos Castillo Oseja, a prominent member of the COSEP who has already suffered at the hands of the regime on many occasions, particularly during a beating by the Minister of the Interior on  April .
.The IOE emphasises that Radio Corporacin, Radio Catlica, Radio Noticias and Radio Mundial were closed down in May , and that Radio Corporacin, Radio Mundial and eight other radio stations were threatened with closure in July . Furthermore, La Prensa, already closed down for two weeks in July , regularly receives threats that it will be closed down again. According to the IOE, this proves that the Government's repressive attitude regarding information remains unchanged.
.Concerning the case of Mr. Mario Alegra, the director of COSEP's research institute sentenced to  years in prison, the IOE objects to the fact that, apart from the disregard shown for the defendant's rights during the investigation (confessions were extracted in illegal conditions), he is still in detention while the appeals court dealing with his case has still not given a verdict, though the time-limit provided for by the Criminal Code of Procedure has long since expired.
.In its communication of  January , the IOE alleges that on  January  the Government ordered the closing down, for an unlimited period, of the programme ""Seis en punto"", broadcast by Radio Corporacin. The programme is accused of having carried news concerning the dismissal of public servants from the Ministry of the Interior. According to the IOE, the news in question had already been carried by pro-government radio stations, which were not ordered closed. The IOE goes on to state that the Government was obliged to revoke this measure in view of its manifest arbitrariness.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government expresses its desire to inform the Committee of the implementation of a set of measures which have been undertaken in the country as a concrete expression of the Government's flexibility and will to promote an improvement in relations among the various social, economic and political sectors and forces in Nicaraguan society.
.In this context, the Government and the higher labour authorities have borne in mind the recommendations and suggestions made by the Governing Body at its November  Session, as well as the opinions expressed by the study mission which visited Nicaragua. The Government thus reports on various measures which were adopted in December .
.Firstly, the Government indicates that it has decided to release Mr. Carlos Humbres in spite of his proven guilt in the matter and the purely political nature of his case. The Government has thus demonstrated its flexibility and its political willingness to achieve peace, since this gesture will be appreciated by those who have participated in the aggression against Nicaragua. This is a genuine expression of the Revolution's desire to create a national consensus in which all of the forces of the country will be able to contribute to the reconstruction of the nation.
.In the same vein, the Government also released the persons involved in the violation of laws concerning public order during the Nandaime events. These releases should also be considered a concrete expression of the Government's flexibility and its readiness to support and intensify a political dialogue with all sectors of the nation in the search for a consensus to tackle the tasks of reconstruction of the country, which is currently suffering from the economic effects of hurricane ""Juana"" and the war of aggression. Although there is no doubt that the defendants violated the law, the Government has deemed it necessary to take concrete steps to create a national climate of responsible and constructive dialogue.
.The Government goes on to say that the President of the Republic, in his New Year's message appealed to all the economic, social and political sectors of the country to establish an effective dialogue on the basis of mutual co-operation so they may patriotically assume the tasks and responsibilities entailed by the current process of national reconstruction.
.Moreover, the labour authorities are currently preparing some legislative reforms which will make it possible to eliminate permanently some problems of compatibility between national laws and regulations and international labour Conventions. These legislative reforms will be implemented separately from the efforts to change the entire labour legislation by means of a new Labour Code. These efforts will obviously represent a large scale task calling for various stages of work in parallel with consultations with employers' and workers' organisations and debate in the National Assembly. The Government intends to keep the ILO informed of the progress of the efforts undertaken to change certain provisions to which the Committee of Experts and the study mission had suggested amendments.
.The Government believes that with the national efforts it is undertaking to find opportunities for constructive dialogue and consensus among the various sectors, it is offering concrete responses to the opinions, suggestions and criteria which were presented to the authorities by the Governing Body and other ILO bodies. The Government reiterates its willingness to continue to intensify the search for points of agreement among the various sectors and thus to consolidate the various expressions of tripartism currently existing in Nicaragua. As in the past, the Government will keep the ILO informed of the results obtained.
.In its communications dated  and  February , the Government points out that there are currently four Labour Code projects, one drafted by the Government and the others by various opposition movements (political parties and a central labour organisation). These projects will be presented at the next parliamentary session for debate and, possibly, adoption. The discussions concerning the Labour Code are prominent on the agenda of the next session of the National Assembly. The latter has engaged in consultations with the employers' and workers' organisations of the country. The approval of the new Labour Code has been declared a priority by the Assembly and is an item on the agenda of the - session.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour is establishing an institutional consultative body, between workers and employers without any distinction whatsoever, so that the social problems that affect them may be discussed more expeditiously.
.As regards the application of Convention No. , the Government points out that, since January , the process of tripartite consultation has been intensified in the context of national consensus. The President of the Republic, the Minister of Industry, Economy and Commerce and the Minister of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Reform had discussions with all the employers' groups in the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. They have also met with the central labour organisations with a view to defining the framework of integration for the country's economic reconstruction. These meetings have led to the adoption of a series of political and legal guarantees of private enterprise activities, the creation of joint ventures funded by the State and the private sector, and the establishment of mechanisms allowing for ongoing consultation with the agents of national economic activity. The Government is of the opinion that these initiatives created a new atmosphere of confidence. Through its leader, Mr. Gurdian, the COSEP has recommended its affiliates to participate in all discussions and meetings with the governmental authority,",0,1988,Nicaragua
97,"with a view to looking for agreement and consultative formulae.
.As regards lands confiscated from private employers, the Government states that the application of legal confiscation measures has been reduced since . In that year  properties were affected; this figure dropped to  in  and to only six in . In his address of  January  to the National Assembly, the President of the Republic announced that no more land would be confiscated, since a first phase of the agrarian reform has now been completed and the productive exploitation of the land redistributed to , farmer families must now be consolidated. According to the Government, the present land ownership structure is as follows: private property (large landowners, co-operatives, small and medium producers),  per cent; State sector,  per cent; uncultivated land,  per cent.
.Within the national consultation process defined by the Government for , and in a perspective of economic reconstruction of the country once the war will have subsided, the President of the Republic has announced to the producers and entrepreneurs that a ""legal security"" would be granted on property, with a view to establishing a better atmosphere of mutual confidence and credibility. This atmosphere is illustrated by the fact that the Government and the private consortium Nicaragua Sugar have decided to settle their differences with respect to the control of the San Antonio complex. The Government has granted a realistic indemnity to the owners, as well as a series of guarantees and support measures to other businesses providing goods and services belonging to the same economic group.
.The Government recalls in this regard that the Committee on Freedom of Association has decided several times that ""cases where legal standards on possession and ownership of land are challenged do not concern the exercise of union rights"".
.As regards the closing-down of the news programmes ""The Nicaraguan"" and ""Seis en Punto"", the Directorate of Media of the Ministry of the Interior, by resolution of  January , has accepted a request for the resumption of these two programmes, after a re-examination of the cases under the legislation in force.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that in the framework of its systematic efforts to create a climate of coexistence and social harmony among all the economic sectors, which have intensified over the last few weeks, the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, led by the Minister, have requested the President of the Republic to give special attention to the circumstances and the present stage reached in the trial against Mr. Alegra with a view to examining a measure which, while respecting the national juridical order and the full independence of the powers of the State, would demonstrate in a concrete manner the Government's desire for conciliation. This was requested independently of any factors concerning Mr. Alegra's guilt. Identical steps have been taken in Mr. Guillermo Quant's case; he is also a member of COSEP and sentenced for spying. The Government will inform the Committee of any forthcoming decisions coming from the President's Office or from any other State powers. These will probably be able to be adopted in the next few days.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that Mr. Felipe Martinez, a CUS official, was released during the last week of January.
.As regards tripartism, the Government announces that it is taking the necessary measures for the creation, in the month of March, of a special tripartite consultative commission. The first item it will have to deal with is the Convention on safety and health in construction which was recently adopted by the International Labour Conference.
.As regards the elaboration of the Labour Code already referred to in its previous communications, the Government states that the labour authorities have, during the preparation of the new Code, given special importance to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Government confirms that it will request the technical assistance of the Office.
.Moreover, the Government adds that the Accords signed by the Heads of State of Central America on  and  February have enlarged the political framework necessary for a thorough study of a package of measures to enable the efficient realisation of national consultation, involving all sectors, for the economic reconstruction of the country. As a direct consequence of the Government's wish for peace and of the Accords in question, in the coming days a broad amnesty will be adopted which will cover the repatriation or homecoming of persons linked to the activities carried out against the nation. . In its communication of  February , the Government states that, on  February, the summit meeting of Central American Presidents adopted a series of Accords which will have profound repercussions on the solution of the various problems which have been the subject of allegations before the Committee. The measures affecting internal politics proposed by the Government to contribute to peace in the region cover the whole range of legal and economic relations between the different sectors of the country and the Government. Thus, the following measures - the amendment of the election laws, the revision of the laws concerning the communications media, the change in the composition of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the decision to hold at an earlier date the national presidential, legislative and municipal elections - constitute fundamental steps which have direct consequences on the natural contradictions and problems existing between the labour sectors and the Government, opening new avenues for consultation and comprehension between them. In these circumstances, the Government considers it important that the Committee suggest conciliation measures at this present jucture so that a reasonable delay be granted enabling an examination of the functioning of the Accords and their repercussion in the labour fields, at least until June , before proposing initiatives such as a commission of inquiry which would not in any way serve the reconciliation process, but would, on the contrary, introduce tension.
.The Committee has noted the Government's replies to the various recommendations it made at its meeting in November , but must observe that these replies do not cover some of the most important points raised by the Committee.
.Regarding the legal aspect of the cases before it, the Committee notes that the Government is currently preparing the modification of certain legislative provisions which had been the subject of comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. The Government will keep the ILO informed of these amendments. In addition, the work already undertaken on the adoption of a new Labour Code is continuing. The Committee notes in particular that four Labour Code drafts will be discussed during the next parliamentary session, and that, according to the Government, consultations have been initiated with employers' and workers' organisations. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the technical assistance of the International Labour Office will be asked for in the preparation of the Code. It notes the Government's statement that special importance has been given in the draft to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Committee recalls in that respect the urgent need for the adoption of labour legislation compatible with Conventions Nos.  and , and reminds the Government that all the employers' and workers' organisations, as well as the ILO, should be involved in the drafting of this legislation.
.The Committee further notes that the Government provides no information on the measures it considers taking to adopt legislation to guarantee fully the exercise of civil liberties and broaden judicial safeguards, as the Committee recommended in November .
.The Committee takes note of the efforts reported by the Government to strengthen tripartism and create an institutional consultative body. In particular it notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special tripartite consultative commission which will examine issues linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . The Committee requests the Government to supply specific information on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.
.Regarding the confiscated lands, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government on the decrease in the number of these measures since , and the declaration of the President of the Republic to the effect that no more land would be confiscated. The Committee once again expresses hope that the Government will re-open the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossessed.
.With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these programmes have now resumed. The Committee must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media, and recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.
.Regarding the allegations concerning imprisonments, the Committee notes the release of persons arrested after the demonstration organised in Nandaime in July . The Committee had, however, considered that, because of its political character, the demonstration was",-1,1988,Nicaragua
98,"not within its competence. However, the Government has not replied to the requests made by the Committee for information on the situation of certain detained unionists. The Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad measure of amnesty in the coming days. It expresses the firm hope that this amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and it requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. The Committee also notes the Government's statement that the file concerning Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic for special examination and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.
.Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of State of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.
.The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these Accords will be able to be implemented in the shortest possible time and that their application will have favourable and immediate repercussions on the observance of the Conventions on freedom of association both in fact and in law. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the measures which the Government has to take to ensure this application should cover the elaboration and adoption of a new labour code as well as legislation guaranteeing fully the exercise of civil liberties. They should also cover the release of the leaders of employers' and workers' organisations to which the Committee attaches special importance. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply, as rapidly as possible, precise, concrete and detailed information on the measures that will be taken in this respect. In the meantime, the Committee invites the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take the appropriate preparatory measures so that the Governing Body will have before it, at its next session, proposals concerning the composition of a commission of inquiry and concerning the financial arrangements necessary for the work of this commission in the event that the Committee and the Governing Body consider the information supplied by the Government to be unsatisfactory and the Governing Body consequently decides to establish such a commission.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) As regards the legislative aspect of the cases, the Committee notes that the Government is preparing the amendment of certain legislative provisions and that four draft Labour Codes will be discussed by the National Assembly during the next sitting of Parliament. The Committee recalls the urgent need for the adoption of new labour legislation in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  and the importance of involving all the workers' and employers' organisations, as well as the ILO, in its elaboration.b) As regards the exercise of civil liberties and judicial safeguards, the Committee impresses upon the Government that legislation fully guaranteeing these liberties and broadening the legal safeguards should be adopted as soon as possible, and it requests the Government to supply information on the measures it intends to take in this regard.c) As regards tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special commission which will examine questions linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . It requests the Government to supply specific information on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.d) As regards the confiscation of land, the Committee again expresses the hope that the Government will re-open the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossessed.e) With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these have now resumed but must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media. It recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.f) Regarding the detention of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations, the Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad amnesty in the coming days. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. It also notes the Government's statement that the file of Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.g) Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of State of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.h) The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these Accords will be able to be implemented in the shortest possible time and that their application will have favourable and immediate repercussions on the observance of the Conventions on freedom of association both in fact and in law. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the measures which the Government has to take to ensure this application should cover the elaboration and adoption of a new labour code as well as legislation guaranteeing fully the exercise of civil liberties. They should also cover the release of the leaders of employers' and workers' organisations to which the Committee attaches special importance.

In the meantime, the Committee invites the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take the appropriate preparatory measures so that the Governing Body will have before it, at its next session, proposals concerning the composition of a commission of inquiry and concerning the financial arrangements necessary for the work of this commission in the event that the Committee and the Governing Body consider the information supplied by the Government to be unsatisfactory and the Governing Body consequently decides to establish such a commission.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In conformity with the invitation extended by the Government of Nicaragua in a communication dated  May , a study mission visited Nicaragua from  September to  October  (see the mission report annexed hereto).
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua which it has examined on a number of occasions. (See, in particular, the th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).) In addition, three new complaints have been presented by the ICFTU in communications dated  March,  April,  and  May, and  July , by the WCL in a communication of  August (Case No. ) and by the IOE in communications dated  June and  and  July  (Case No. ).
.In a communication of  June , several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua for infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite",0,1988,Nicaragua
99,"Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in May , the Committee invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )):(a) The Committee reminds the Government that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights, and requests it to take the necessary measures to ensure that such protection is effectively provided.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the arrest and current situation of the trade unionists Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.(c) The Committee, while noting with interest that the rights suspended by the state of emergency have been restored, requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on the resumption of activities by employers' and workers' organisations in practice, particularly as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, exercise of the right of assembly, registration of these organisations and exercise of the right to strike.(d) Noting that Decree No.  is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of voluntary collective negotiation, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this situation and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt in this connection.(e) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.(f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.The above-mentioned study mission was carried out from  September to  October  by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, accompanied by Mr. Bernard Gernigon, Chief of the ILO Freedom of Association Branch, and Mr. Christian Ramos, an official of said Branch. The report of the representative of the Director-General appears as an annex to this document.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to express its thanks to Mr. Fernando Uribe Restrepo for having undertaken this study mission as the Director-General's representative and for his detailed report on the matters pending.
.Since the complaints and the information gathered during the mission are all analysed in the report of the Director-General's representative, the Committee can proceed directly to its conclusions on the various cases.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes the report of the study mission carried out in Nicaragua and the facilities granted by the authorities to the Director-General's representative for carrying out his mission. It deplores however the fact that the Director-General's representative was not authorised to meet one of the imprisoned persons with whom the mission had asked to speak.b) The Committee requests the Government to furnish a copy of the text of the judgement that will be handed down in the case of CUS trade unionists now held at the ""Zona franca"" penitentiary compound in Managua mentioned in paragraph  above.c) The Committee requests the Government to consider the adoption of amnesty or reduced sentence measures in respect of Mr. Milton Silva Gaitn and Mr. Arcadio Ortz Espinoza, two trade unionists who were sentenced to five and six years' imprisonment.d) The Committee requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.e) The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the arrest of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above (specific facts motivating the arrests, text of the judgements, place of detention).f) As regards the arrests carried out during a hunger strike organised by the Permanent Congress of Workers, the Committee reminds the Government that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is made entails restrictions on freedom of association and that governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities receive appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of arrests being based on trade union activities.g) As regards the attacks carried out against trade union premises and the threats against trade unionists, the Committee recalls that activities of this kind create among trade unionists a climate of fear which is extremely prejudicial to the exercise of trade union activities and that the authorities, when informed of such matters, should carry out an immediate investigation to determine who is responsible and punish the guilty parties.h) As regards the measures taken following the demonstration in Nandaime, the Committee considers, in view of the political nature of this demonstration, that the matter should be examined by other international bodies which have general competence in respect of human rights.i) As regards the confiscation of property, the Committee considers that this measure appears to have been particularly biased against the COSEP leaders and members and it considers that all the provisions relating to compensation for expropriated land should be reviewed to ensure that there is real and fair compensation for the losses sustained by the landowners and that the Government should reopen the compensation files when so requested by persons who consider that they have been despoiled.j) As regards the conviction of Mr. Alegra, the Committee expresses its concern at the procedure followed in this case and at the extreme harshness of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Court of Appeal in Managua will re-examine the case with all the requisite attentiveness and impartiality. It requests the Government to furnish a copy of the decision reached by the Court of Appeal as soon as it is available.k) As regards civil liberties connected with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that unduly severe restrictions still remain and therefore requests the Government to take advantage of the peace process that has begun in Nicaragua to adopt legislation that will fully guarantee the exercise of public freedoms and broaden judicial safeguards.l) As regards tripartite consultations on international labour standards, the Committee requests the Government to set up and convene as soon as possible an advisory committee on this subject - which should be representative of all employers' and workers' organisations - and to furnish information on the setting up and meetings of this advisory committee.m) On the subject of trade union legislation, the Committee urges the Government to work with all the workers' and employers' organisations - and with the ILO as already accepted by the Government - on the drafting of the new Labour Code which it intends to prepare and it expresses the firm hope that the Government will be able to report very shortly substantial progress towards new legislation in line with Conventions Nos.  and .n) In view of the conclusions it has thus reached, the Committee observes that the situation of employers' and workers' organisations in Nicaragua gives rise to major problems in relation to several basic principles concerning freedom of association and trade union rights. The Committee accordingly considers that the Government should take concrete measures in the shortest possible time to apply fully the Conventions on freedom of association which it has ratified. These measures should cover all the problems which arise in law in relation to both the preparation of a new Labour Code and the adoption of legislation guaranteeing the full exercise of civil liberties. These legal measures should be accompanied by measures relating to factual situations, such as, in the first place, the release of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations at present in detention. Should the Government not supply, before the next meeting of the Committee in February , information demonstrating a change in attitude as regards these matters and a clear desire to make progress as regards the situation of employers' and workers' organisations, as well as their leaders and members, the Committee would consider it necessary to refer the matter to the Governing Body recommending to it the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry in conformity with article , paragraph , of the Constitution.",-1,1988,Nicaragua
100,".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented by virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, alleging infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has examined these matters on several occasions, in particular in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot in September-October  by a study mission, and in February and May  (see th and th Reports, approved by the Governing Body at its nd and rd Sessions (February-March and May  respectively)).
.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted further information in communications dated  June and  August . The Government supplied information in communications dated  June and  and  October .
.During its examination of the cases in May , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:(a) As regards the drafting of a new Labour Code, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations are still being held with employers' and workers' organisations, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. Noting with concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted by the Government, the Committee requests the Government to hear the views of this organisation and to send rapidly an assistance request to the Office. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code, while expressing the firm hope that all the opinions expressed by the employers' and workers' organisations will be taken into account, without exception.(b) Concerning the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that a new Act on communications media has been adopted. It notes with regret that the Ministry of the Interior retains the power to impose temporary suspensions on the media. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the decrees violating freedom of speech in economic matters, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.(c) With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a meeting concerning the agricultural sector has taken place and that such a meeting will be organised in the near future for the industrial sector. The Committee asks the Government to indicate whether the COSEP was invited to these meetings as an employers' organisation. The Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing tripartite consultations commission on international labour standards, composed of all workers' and employers' organisations without exception. It requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in that respect.(d) As regards the detentions, the Committee notes with interest that Messrs. Alegra, Quant and several CUS trade unionists have been released. The Committee deplores that these persons have been detained for long periods and expresses the hope that they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in conformity with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the arrest on  June  of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, and on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza.(f) The Committee once more requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged detention of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.(g) Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November Session the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.
.In its communication dated  June , the IOE alleges that, following a meeting held two days earlier by the Association of Coffee Producers of Nicaragua (UNCAFENIC), affiliated to COSEP, at which the policy of the Coffee Committee, an official body, was seriously challenged, the Government decided on the immediate expropriation of the land owned by the Association's President, A. Alemn Lacayo, and by N. Bolaos Geyer and J. Cuadra Sommabira, officials of UNCAFENIC and of the Association of Coffee Producers of Magalpa, the town where the meeting was held. The officials were accused by the Government of refusing to negotiate and of encouraging anarchy, confrontation and the breakdown of negotiations. In fact, UNCAFENIC is in total disagreement with an economic policy that is being imposed on it through so-called negotiations and is making its opinion known to its members, which is the role and the right of an employers' organisation.
.In the view of the IOE, the expropriation is very much in the spirit of similar measures that have been brought to the attention of the Committee on Freedom of Association on numerous occasions, which are designed to intimidate and muzzle the leaders of COSEP and of one of its principal members, the Union of Agricultural Producers of Nicaragua (UPANIC).
.The IOE mentions another instance of arbitrary confiscation of land belonging to a COSEP leader that was ordered as a reprisal after COSEP criticised the Government's economic policy. The day after the holding of a meeting on  July  in Estelli to prepare COSEP's General Assembly, the Government confiscated the land of the President and host of the preparatory meeting, Jos Mara Briones.
.The IOE recalls that the President of the Republic announced in a statement on  January  that no more land would be confiscated. According to the IOE, the fact that the Government has gone back on these recent undertakings, as it has done so often in the past, should at last convince the Committee that the Government is pursuing its discriminatory policy, is endeavouring to destabilise COSEP and is accordingly continuing to attack its leaders systematically.
.In its communication dated  August  the IOE submits a number of comments on the earlier replies - or lack of replies - from the Government. The IOE believes that the Government is attempting to pass off a number of measures it claims to have taken as a policy of consultation and negotiation with the social partners, including in the areas coming within the purview of the ILO. The Government's statements to this effect are misleading, if not downright untruths: either the measures were never taken by the Government or never involved COSEP or its members as such, or else they were taken in very different circumstances from those suggested by the Government. The IOE cites a number of examples.
.According to the IOE, for instance, the national tripartite consultations in the agricultural sector that are presented as tangible evidence of negotiation involved neither COSEP nor UPANIC, a member of COSEP, as such, but were held with people hand-picked by the Government from among the members of COSEP and UPANIC. Neither COSEP nor UPANIC, as such, were able to have their views represented.
.The IOE goes on to state that, when these organisations got together as best they could to discuss how to put across their points of view, which happened to disagree with the Government's economic policy,",0,1988,Nicaragua
101,"they were accused of economic sabotage, their leaders had their land expropriated and at the same time those who indicated their intention to withdraw from consultations in these circumstances were threatened with expropriation by the Minister for Agrarian Reform and by the President of the Republic himself. Thus the so-called consultations were turned into ""compulsory meetings"" conducted under the threat of sanctions.
.The Government has tried to show Mr. Gurdian, Vice-President of COSEP and President of UPANIC, as being in favour of the kind of consultations described above. However, Mr. Gurdian's opinion is perhaps better expressed by himself and by UPANIC: in a statement to La Prensa Mr. Gurdian said: ""These are not consultations at all but a form of blackmail that has frightened those who have been convened by the Government"".
.The IOE adds that it was the ILO, not the Government, that organised - and prepared with the Minister of Labour well in advance - the consultations that were held on  to  May  on the revision of Convention No. . At the request of the ILO, the Government sent a letter of invitation dated Tuesday,  May, that was delivered directly to COSEP on Friday,  May, at . p.m., leaving it barely  hours to find an expert by Monday,  May, to take part in the discussion of a highly specialised and controversial issue, which, as it turned out, it was unable to do.
.The national tripartite consultation for the industrial sector announced by the Government for May never took place and was apparently replaced by the creation of an Advisory Committee for Industry on which members of the Chamber of Industry were invited by the Government to sit in an individual capacity.
.According to the IOE, the meetings for the industrial sector and those for the agricultural sector were devoted essentially to the desperate economic situation of the country and of enterprises in general. The issues still pending between the ILO and Nicaragua, such as enjoyment of freedom of association, freedom of assembly and freedom to negotiate, were never raised. The meetings are only tripartite in name, since none of the trade unions which rival the official trade unions - the Sandinista Confederation of Workers (CST) and the Association of Rural Workers (ATC) - are invited and, as the discussions revolve essentially around economic issues, even the participation of the two official federations is purely symbolic, their presence being announced but virtually ignored.
.Regarding the reform of labour legislation and specifically the discussion and approval of the new Labour Code, the Government claims for the second time that consultations have begun and are continuing to advance with COSEP, pointing by way of proof to the holding of several seminars on the subject in April . On this point, the IOE states that there were exactly three meetings between January and May that COSEP was invited by the Government to attend:- one ostensibly tripartite meeting on labour inspection to which COSEP was invited ten minutes before the meeting started without being told what aspect of labour inspection was being discussed. At such short notice, COSEP was not able to attend or to put the employers' point of view;- a tripartite meeting on vocational training and employment creation, organised by the ILO and not by the Government;- a meeting, likewise organised by the ILO in Nicaragua (and in a whole series of other countries) and not by the Government, in connection with the second discussion of the revision of Convention No.  at the th Session of the International Labour Conference. Again, the notice it received was too short for COSEP to be represented.In all three cases the amendment of the labour legislation and the drafting of a new Labour Code was neither discussed nor on the agenda. COSEP therefore asserts once again that it was never consulted either by the National Assembly or by the Minister of Labour on the reform or amendment of labour legislation or the approval of a new Labour Code..The IOE notes that the Government has ignored the Committee's insistence, based largely on the observations of the  study mission, that legislation on judicial safeguards be adopted as soon as possible and has not supplied the information that was requested on the subject. It also observes that the Government has not responded to the hope expressed on several occasions by the Committee that it will compensate those who have been unfairly dispossessed of their land. The IOE cites an instance of pure and simple refusal to compensate one of the leaders of COSEP who was recently dispossessed, as well as the Government's refusal to hand over several farms whose confiscation was annulled by the Supreme Court. Other requests for compensation for the confiscation of land are still pending - and it cites the cases of Mr. Aleman, Mr. Bolaos and Mr. Cuadra. The IOE also considers that the Government has not supplied the information that was requested on the scope of the amnesty declared in February . In point of fact, the Government merely issued pardons, which are a considerably less lenient type of measure. The IOE wishes to know whether the proceedings instituted against employer and worker leaders who were summarily sentenced and then released are still before the courts and, if not, whether a pardon extinguishes the court proceedings and means that the sentence handed down by the lower court remains on the record.

.The IOE goes on to state that the Government is incapable of producing any convocation or agenda that it might have sent to COSEP or even the minutes of any meeting that COSEP might have attended, specifically with respect to the past or future discussion of the many important reforms which the Government promised the study mission would be made to the country's labour legislation and which the Committee on Freedom of Association or the Committee of Experts have been calling for each year for many years. The IOE challenges the Government to produce proof of its assertion that COSEP was consulted by the committee set up by the National Assembly to draft the new Labour Code. The IOE also maintains that the tripartite round table which the Government had promised in August-September  would be held very shortly has never been convened.
.In conclusion, the IOE considers that there have been so many shortcomings and inaccurate statements that only an impartial commission of inquiry could establish what the real situation is and whether or not the allegations of the complainants and the Government's replies are true.
.In a communication dated  June , the Government calls for technical and economic assistance in holding tripartite seminars and other similar forms of consultation in order to achieve its objective of reforming the Labour Code. According to the Government, this request is undeniable proof of the authorities' spirit of co-operation and firm intention to respond to the Committee's comments.
.In its letter of  October , the Government states that in accordance with the agreements signed between the President of the Republic and representatives of the legally constituted political parties, the National Assembly has had a very heavy agenda. It approved a Decree pardoning  persons who had been found guilty and were imprisoned for infringing the Act respecting the maintenance of public order and safety; it amended the Act respecting the media by entrusting the Supreme Electoral Council with the enforcement of this legislation and of the regulations issued thereunder in respect of problems connected with electoral law. The Assembly also approved amendments to the Act in respect of the judicial powers of the Sandinista police whereby",0,1988,Nicaragua
102,"all such judicial functions (trials and sentencing) are suspended, the police now being competent only in respect of investigations into and penalties in respect of offences committed by its own members. The Act is now referred to as the Sandinista Police Functions Act. The Assembly also unanimously approved an Act to amend Decree No.  (Act respecting the maintenance of public order and safety). According to this new Act, all the provisions in the Penal Code concerning rebellion, sedition and treason, which were covered by Decree No. , remain in force in the Penal Code. All offences stipulated in the Decree will therefore be punishable under the Penal Code. Lastly, the Assembly is giving priority consideration to an Act in respect of non-military national service presented by the Democratic Conservative Party.
.Because of its heavy schedule, as well as by the agreements reached in Tela (Honduras) by the Central American Heads of State, the plenary of the National Assembly has not yet been able to study the reforms to the labour legislation. Nevertheless, it is still the Government's intention to amend this legislation to bring it into line with ILO Conventions.
.The Government recalls that in accordance with the Costa del Sol (El Salvador) agreement of  February , it undertook to organise elections for the Presidency, the National Assembly and the Central American Parliament before  February  and to invite international observers, in particular from the United Nations (UNO) and the Organisation of American States (OAS), to see that the elections are held freely. The electoral process has now entered its second stage with the massive arrival of international observers including, for short periods, the Secretary-General of the OAS. A number of candidatures have been put forward for the Presidency. The Government states in this respect that Mr. Bolaos Gayer, honourary chairman of COSEP, wished to stand as the candidate for the National Union of the Opposition but was defeated. On that occasion, the COSEP made public appeals to vote. At the moment, the electoral lists are being drawn up.
.Following the Tela agreement of  August , signed by the Central American Heads of State, a joint plan was drawn up for the demobilisation, repatriation or voluntary settlement in Nicaragua and other countries of members of the Nicaraguan resistance and their families. To implement the plan, the International Support and Verification Commission (CIAV) was set up and the general secretaries of the UNO and the OAS were invited to participate. The Government and the CIAV are in direct contact with the resistance movement in order to promote the repatriation or resettlement of its members and their integration in the political process. Former resistance leaders have submitted their candidature for the coming parliamentary elections and one of them for the Presidency.
.According to the Government, all this shows the intense activity being carried out in Nicaragua for the benefit of all citizens without distinction. These activities will lead to the restoration, once and for all, of peace and the stabilisation of the economy. The new Government will then be able to embark on plans to raise the standard of living.
.For the Government, the measures thus adopted also meet a number of concerns expressed by the Committee. Thus the rescinding of the Act respecting the maintenance of public order and safety and the amendments to the Act respecting the judicial powers of the Sandinista police respond to the recommendation concerning the early adoption of legislation fully guaranteeing the exercise of public freedom and judicial safeguards. The same applies to the amnesty measures adopted by the National Assembly.
.According to the Government, in view of all these factors and since, because of the forthcoming elections, there are already international observers in the country from governmental, non-governmental and humanitarian organisations, the Government considers that this is not the time to send a commission of inquiry, which might be used politically, thus diverting it from its real purpose. Moreover, because there is full freedom of association, of expression and of movement, the Government does not consider it necessary to set up a commission of inquiry which would reach conclusions that are obvious and internationally known. Besides, this would involve the Organisation in unnecessary expense.
.In its communication of  October , the Government transmits the text of a resolution adopted on  October  by the European Parliament on the Tela meeting of Central American Heads of State and the Nicaraguan elections. In this resolution, the European Parliament expresses its satisfaction that the electoral process has been set in motion in Nicaragua and hopes that the  February  elections will offer to all political parties every guarantee of freedom, honesty and equal access to information media.
.The Committee has carefully examined the developments which have taken place in this matter since its meeting in May . However, it has not been able to take account of communications from the Government dated  October and  November , nor of a communication from the IOE dated  November  which arrived too late to allow a thorough examination of them.
.The Committee notes that the Government's communications of  June and  October  show that the Government has taken some positive measures along the lines of the recommendations previously made by the Committee, in particular the organisation of a tripartite seminar under the auspices of the ILO and the adoption of an amnesty decree in favour of persons sentenced for infringing the Act on the maintenance of public order and safety.
.Nevertheless, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied replies to some of the questions put by the Committee at its previous meeting, in particular in relation to the establishment of a standing committee on tripartite consultations concerning international labour standards and in relation to certain decrees violating freedom of economic information. In addition, the Government has not replied to the allegations made by the IOE in June and August  concerning the confiscation of land belonging to employers' leaders and the refusal to pay compensation and to restore farms to their owners. It also appears that, for a number of points at issue, contradictions still remain between the statements made by the complainants and by the Government, particularly regarding consultations on the preparation of the new Labour Code.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body that it transmit this affair as a whole to a commission of inquiry for examination, in conformity with article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the ILO. In making this recommendation, the Committee in no way is prejudging the situation in Nicaragua and even less is attributing blame to or expressing condemnation of the Government. On the contrary, it is convinced that the establishment of this commission will enable, in collaboration with the authorities and the social partners, a positive contribution to be made to solving the issues facing this country in the field of labour and industrial relations, issues which the Government has, on several occasions, stated that it wishes to resolve.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented in virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, of infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has examined these questions on several occasions, including in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot in September-October , and in February  (see th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March )).
.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted new allegations in communications of  April and  May",0,1988,Nicaragua
103,". The Government supplied its observations in communications dated , ,  and  .
.During its examination of the cases in February-March , the Governing Body approved the following recommendations of the Committee:a) As regards the legislative aspect of the cases, the Committee notes that the Government is preparing the amendment of certain legislative provisions and that four draft Labour Codes will be discussed by the National Assembly during the next sitting of Parliament. The Committee recalls the urgent need for the adoption of new labour legislation in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  and the importance of involving all the workers' and employers' organisations, as well as the ILO, in its elaboration.b) As regards the exercise of civil liberties and judicial safeguards, the Committee impresses upon the Government that legislation fully guaranteeing these liberties and broadening the legal safeguards should be adopted as soon as possible, and it requests the Government to supply information on the measures it intends to take in this regard.c) As regards tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special commission which will examine questions linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . It requests the Government to supply specific information on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.d) As regards the confiscation of land, the Committee again expresses the hope that the Government will reopen the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossesed.e) With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these have now resumed but must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media. It recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.f) Regarding the detention of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations, the Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad amnesty in the coming days. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. It also notes the Government's statement that the file of Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.g) Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of States of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.h) The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these Accords will be able to be implemented in the shortest possible time and that their application will have favourable and immediate repercussions on the observance of the Conventions on freedom of association both in fact and in law. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the measures which the Government has to take to ensure this application should cover the elaboration and adoption of a new labour code as well as legislation guaranteeing fully the exercise of civil liberties. They should also cover the release of the leaders of employers' and workers' organisations to which the Committee attaches special importance. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply, as rapidly as possible, precise, concrete and detailed information on the measures that will be taken in this respect. In the meantime, the Committee invites the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take the appropriate preparatory measures so that the Governing Body will have before it, at its next session, proposals concerning the composition of a commission of inquiry and concerning the financial arrangements necessary for the work of this commission in the event that the Committee and the Governing Body consider the information supplied by the Government to be unsatisfactory and the Governing Body consequently decides to establish such a commission.
.In its communication of  April , the IOE states that the Government, contrary to its declarations, has never consulted, let alone advised the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP) about the legislative reform it is allegedly preparing. According to the IOE, these statements are made to deceive the ILO and international public opinion.
.The IOE adds that the National Assembly never consulted the COSEP on the Labour Code revision, or on any other legislation. Furthermore, the Minister of Labour did not consult the COSEP about the establishment of an institutional consultative body. The IOE explains that early in , several ministries - but not the Ministry of Labour - contacted certain organisations that are members of the COSEP with a view to discussing the economic recovery of the country. These occasional contacts, which have not been followed up let alone formalised, cannot in any way be regarded as constituting the establishment of a joint consultative body mandated to discuss social problems.
.The IOE also mentions that the Government, contrary to the assurances given in March  to the Committee on Freedom of Association, has not established a special tripartite consultative commission.
.The IOE adds that as of the date of its communication, neither Mr. Alegra, director of the Nicaraguan Institute of Economic and Social Studies (INIESEP) which reports to the COSEP, nor Mr. Quant, Vice-Chairman of the Chamber of Industry, charged with espionage and sentenced to a -year gaol term, have been released.
.Finally, the IOE considers that the amnesty which is part of the Accords concluded by the Central American Heads of State had no positive influence on the matters submitted to the Committee. According to the IOE, no detained employer or worker leader has so far benefited from this amnesty which has in fact been reduced to a pardon - a far less clement measure.
.The IOE concludes by stating that all these facts prove that it is necessary to constitute a commission of inquiry with a view to establishing on an impartial basis the real situation with respect to freedom of association and to the compliance of commitments accepted by Nicaragua through ratification of Conventions Nos. ,  and . The IOE attaches to its communication a declaration signed by the presidents of international and national employers' organisations in support of its complaint against the Government of Nicaragua.
.In its communication of  May , the IOE announces the release of Mr. Alegra, declared not guilty by the Managua Court of Appeal on  April . The IOE points out that at the time of his arrest and during his  months' imprisonment, Mr. Alegra did not enjoy the civil rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Without these rights, union rights are devoid of any real meaning, as recalled by the ILO resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil rights, adopted by the International Labour Conference in .
.The IOE underlines that, in addition to Mr. Alegra's arrest and arbitrary detention which violated the COSEP and INIESEP freedom of speech, Mr. Alegra was denied the right to a fair trial until his final acquittal. The IOE recalls in this respect that unspecified documents belonging to the INIESEP were confiscated by the prosecution which intended to use them, that Mr. Alegra has been obliged to make televised statements potentially damaging to his case, and that the Court of Appeal substantially exceeded the delays permitted by the Code of Criminal Procedure, i.e. ten months instead of six. The IOE considers that, in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article .), which binds Nicaragua, the COSEP, the INIESEP and Mr. Alegra are entitled to be compensated for the moral and material prejudice they have incurred, which was made even worse by the publicity given to the initial judgement, both at the national and international level.
.The IOE further states that the Legislative Assembly of Nicaragua has adopted on  April  a new Act on communications media, which embodies a series of principles proclaiming the freedom of the press. The IOE adds the Nicaraguan Constitution of  already enshrined a complete freedom of information that the Sandinist regime did not respect in practice, which is illustrated by the number of radio programmes closed as recently as a few weeks ago, by the fact that the COSEP was not permitted to launch an independent television channel, and by the censorship, the closings and the threats imposed upon the daily newspaper La Prensa. As regards the new Act, the IOE deplores the fact that Chapters",-1,1988,Nicaragua
104,"VIII to XI include provisions enabling the Ministry of the Interior to admonish and order the temporary closing of communications media in a series of circumstances so vaguely defined that all abuses of the recent past could be repeated. The IOE adds that this Act does not modify Decree No.  of  which, combined with Decree No.  of , grants the monopoly of economic data publication to a state body, namely the Nicaraguan Institute of Statistics and Enumeration. According to the IOE, these two decrees constitute a breach of freedom of information in Nicaragua, and especially a violation of the INIESEP's and COSEP's right to inform their members and the general public.
.In its communication of  May , the Government announces that Mr. Alegra was released on  April . Furthermore, the competent committee of the National Assembly has approved a pardon in the case of Mr. Guillermo Quant. This case will be submitted to the plenary assembly on  May.
.In its communication of  May , the Government confirms the release of Mr. Mario Alegra, pursuant to the judgement issued by the Criminal Chamber of the Appeals Court of Managua. It adds that on  May , the National Assembly approved the pardon granted to Mr. Guillermo Quant, a COSEP member who had been convicted for a documented and proven breach of the country's laws. Accordingly, Mr. Quant has also been released.
.The Government further announces the liberation, on  March , of  persons who are allegedly members of the Central Organisation of Unions (CUS), namely: Santos Francisco Garca Cruz, Juan Ramon Gutierrez Lopez, Saturnino Gutierriez Lopez, Juan Alberto Corteras Nuos, Presentacon Muoz Martnez, Ronal Gonzlez Lopez, Arnulfo Gonzalez Olivas, Jacinto Oliva Vallecillo, Salsmn de Jess Vallecillo Martnez, Ricardo Gutierrez Corteras Luis Enrique Garcia Alvarado, Euselio Garca Alvarado, Eduardo Garca Alvarado and Pedro Joaqun Talavera Perez.
.As regards Anastasio Gimenes Maldonado, Justino Rivera, Eva Gonzles and Eliazar Marenco, who were allegedly arrested in , the Government states it is still waiting the complementary information that the Committee had requested from the complainant organisation - i.e. the WCL - on the motives and circumstances surrounding these alleged arrests, in order to adequately follow up these complaints.
.With respect to tripartite consultations, the Government states that certain doubts arose about the viability of a system of a national tripartite consultative commission. According to the Government, all the indications are that tripartite consultations on international labour Conventions and on themes of interest to employers' and workers' organisations are more productive when they are held by sector of activity, or when they focus on specific issues previously identified. For that purpose, the President of the Republic organised during the first half of April a tripartite national consultation in the agricultural sector, with the participation of producers affiliated to COSEP and UNAG and of unions representing workers in this branch of activity. This meeting produced tangible results through the adoption of positive measures for private entrepreneurs: credit policies, tax incentives, government subsidies and marketing of farm products. On the other hand, the employers undertook to respect the workers' rights recognised in the legislation and the collective agreements. The major employer leaders welcomed these results, as established by the statements of Messrs. Gurdian and Dreyfus, leaders of the COSEP. The Government adds that a national tripartite consultation for the industrial sector is planned in May.
.Furthermore, in view of the coming discussion on the revision of Convention No.  on indigenous populations at the International Labour Conference, the Government has organised a national tripartite seminar on this theme, where it invited the COSEP, the UNAG and the most representative workers' organisations. Unfortunately, the COSEP did not participate in the seminar in spite of that invitation.
.As regards the reform and modifications of the labour legislation, and in particular the discussion and adoption of the new Labour Code, the Government states that the process of consultation with workers' and employers' organisations continued and improved, as evidenced by several tripartite seminars held on this theme in April. This consultative process is complex since the various central workers' organisations, which are the tangible expression of union pluralism in the country, are trying to find a consensus which would permit joint initiatives with a view to amending the legislation.
.The Government also indicates that, in view of the agreement concluded at the Summit of the Central American Heads of State on  February , the National Assembly had to debate on a priority basis, during the first months of , the Acts guaranteeing and demonstrating the Government's will to implement the compromises it had accepted as part of the peace initiative in Central America. The Elections Act and the Communications Media Act have thus been reformed. The Government adds that the discussion and adoption of the Labour Code remains a priority on the National Assembly agenda and that the ILO's technical assistance will be requested in due course.
.In conclusion, the Government hopes that this information will enable the Committee objectively to evaluate the efforts it is making to apply the international labour Conventions and to guarantee the rights and claims of employers and workers.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government declares, in response to the most recent allegations made by the IOE, that the fact that the Court of Appeal overturned the judgement of the lower court is additional evidence of the separation of powers in Nicaragua and of the judiciary's independence. The delays incurred before the Court of Appeal issued its judgement probably result from a backlog of work, as happens in other countries. As regards Mr. Alegra's compensation, it is for the courts - not the Committee on Freedom of Association - to decide that point, at the request of the interested party.
.Concerning the general legislation on communications media, the Government reaffirms that this Act has been passed by the Legislative Assembly, where various political parties with differing ideologies are represented. Furthermore, several independent institutes have compared this Act with those of other Latin American countries and found it more liberal.
.In a communication dated  May , the Government mentions that it is facing obstacles in the process of dialogue and consultations it wants to pursue. According to the Government, certain sectors clearly intend to annihilate the efforts it made to redress the country's economy, and want to prevent any possibility of real consultations in the political and economic fields. The Government refers more specifically to the COSEP's attitude which it terms as totally inflexible. The Government explains that the President of the Republic has invited the private sector to take joint steps with it so as to obtain financial resources from the international community. The COSEP then published a press release in which it did not authorise the private sector to participate in joint missions with the Government, which is contrary to the tripartism philosophy it claims to be supporting. Furthermore, the COSEP has excluded employer leaders who had participated in such missions. This inflexible attitude has also led the COSEP not to participate in the consultations on international labour standards (the Government attaches a copy of the letter sent to the COSEP on  May , inviting it to the meeting of  and  May  concerning the revision of Convention No. ). The Government concludes by asking the Committee to note the difference between its attitude and that of the COSEP.
.The Committee notes the replies given by the Government to the various recommendations and information requests made at its February  meeting.
.As regards the legislative aspect of the cases referred to it, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations continue with employers and workers organisations with a view to drafting a new Labour Code, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. The Committee must recall in this respect that the Committee of Experts, in its  observations on the application of Conventions Nos.  and , commented on certain labour legislation provisions which are not compatib with the Conventions, especially those dealing with the following questions: establishment of unions, control of union books and registers, right to strike and collective agreements. Given the significance of these issues for freedom of association and in view of the fact that these observations have been made for several years, the Committee must insist once again on the urgent need for legislation which is compatible with Conventions Nos.  and . The Committee expresses its concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted about the revision of the Labour Code. The Committee requests the Government to hear the representations made by the COSEP on this matter. It firmly hopes that consultations will be successfully held with all the employers' and workers' organisations and that the Government will take into account the opinions expressed by these organisations, without exception. Furthermore, although the Government declared it would consult the ILO in due course, the Committee deplores that no such official request for assistance has been forthcoming as yet. Therefore, it",0,1988,Nicaragua
105,"asks the Government quickly to present such a request to the Office, so that the debate and adoption procedures of the Code may be completed as soon as possible, and that the final text be compatible with Conventions Nos.  and  ratified by Nicaragua. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code.
.As regards the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that the National Assembly has passed a new Act on communications media. While observing that this legislation would now preclude a permanent suspension of press media, the Committee must note with regret that the Ministry of the Interior keeps its power to impose temporary suspensions (three editions in the case of the press, four days for radio and three days for television), notably for second and subsequent violations of the Act. In addition, the Committee requests the Government to provide details on the decrees repealed by this Act; it requests the Government to indicate in particular whether previous decrees violating freedom of speech in the economic field, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.
.With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a national meeting was held in the agricultural sector, and that another such meeting will be held in the near future for the industrial sector. However, it is not clear from the Government's reply whether the employers that are members of the COSEP have been invited on an individual basis to that meeting, or if that invitation was extended to the organisation in its own right. The Committee asks the Government to clarify this point. As regards tripartite consultations held in the country with respect to international labour standards, the Committee notes that the Government organised a meeting concerning the revision of Convention No. . However, it must note that the invitation extended to the COSEP for that meeting was sent very late. The Committee insists that a global consultation policy on international labour standards should be established. In this respect, the Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing commission comprised of all employers' and workers' organisations, without exception, which could meet regularly. The Committee requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.Regarding the allegations of detentions, the Committee notes with interest the release of Messrs. Alegra and Quant, employer leaders, and of several CUS unionists charged with violations of the Act on security and on the maintenance of public order. The Committee can only regret that these persons were detained for long periods. It hopes they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in accordance with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee further notes that the Government did not provide information on the arrest, on  June , of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, namely: Luis Alfaro Centeno, Pastor Garca Matey, Mariano Romero Melgare, Dmaso Gonzlez Sanchez, Jess Cardenas Ordonez, Teodoro Matey Romero (held in detention at San Juan Rio Coco), Jos Matey Owonez and Rafael Ordonez Melgara (detained at La Dalla) and Miguel Valdina of the Union of Agricultural Workers of Posoltega. The Government also failed to provide information on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza, leaders of the National Bus Company Union, who had been convicted for sabotage and sentenced to five and six years' imprisonment respectively.
.As regards the alleged detention of Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Justino Rivera, Eva Gonzlez and Eleazar Marenco, the Committee once more requests the World Confederation of Labour to provide information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest of these persons.
.Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November meeting the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) As regards the drafting of a new Labour Code, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that consultations are still being held with employers' and workers' organisations, and that the ILO will be consulted in due course. Noting with concern that, according to the IOE, the COSEP was not consulted by the Government, the Committee requests the Government to hear the views of this organisation and to send rapidly an assistance request to the Office. The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the progress made in the drafting of the Code, while expressing the firm hope that all the opinions expressed by the employers' and workers' organisations will be taken into account, without exception.b) Concerning the legislation on civil liberties, the Committee notes that a new Act on communications media has been adopted. It notes with regret that the Ministry of the Interior retains the power to impose temporary suspensions on the media. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the decrees violating freedom of speech in economic matters, such as Decrees Nos.  and , remain in force.c) With respect to tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that a meeting concerning the agricultural sector has taken place and that such a meeting will be organised in the near future for the industrial sector. The Committee asks the Government to indicate whether the COSEP was invited to these meetings as an employers' organisation. The Committee points out that it would be beneficial to establish, as the Government had promised in February , a standing tripartite consultations commission on international labour standards, composed of all workers' and employers' organisations without exception. It requests the Government to take such initiatives and to keep it informed of developments in that respect.d) As regards the detentions, the Committee notes with interest that Messrs. Alegra, Quant and several CUS trade unionists have been released. The Committee deplores that these persons have been detained for long periods and expresses the hope that they will be able to resume their activities in their respective employers' and workers' organisations without impediment. As regards Mr. Alegra, the Committee hopes that any compensation request filed by the person concerned will be examined in conformity with the requirements of Article . of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.e) The Committee requests the Government to provide information on the arrest on  June  of agricultural workers who are members of the CUS, mentioned above in paragraph , and on the situation of Messrs. Milton Silva Gaitn and Arcadio Ortz Espinoza.f) The Committee requests once more the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged detention of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.g) Finally, the Committee notes that despite the release of certain employers' and workers' leaders, many important issues raised by the present case have not yet been resolved, notably with respect to the Labour Code and tripartite consultations. In addition, the Government still has not provided information about certain detained trade unionists. In the above circumstances, the Committee strongly urges the Government to provide precise and positive information on all the above issues. This information should be provided sufficiently in advance. The Committee postpones until its November Session the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a commission of inquiry.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented in virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the",0,1988,Nicaragua
106,"right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, of infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has examined these questions on several occasions, most recently in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot from  September to  October  by a study mission conducted by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted new allegations in communications of  December  and  January . The Government supplied its observations in communications dated  January and , , ,  and  February .
.In its communication of  December , the IOE alleges that on  October  the Ministry of the Interior banned, for an unlimited period, the radio programme broadcast on Radio Mundial by the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), entitled ""The Nicaraguan"". According to the IOE, this programme reviews the main features of the economic and social situation of the country and suggests possible solutions in which the COSEP and its members would like to co-operate.
.Moreover, the IOE notes that on  November , also by order of the Ministry of the Interior, the programme ""Seis en Punto"" broadcast by Radio Corporacin was banned indefinitely. The IOE points out that the Director of Radio Corporacin and of the banned programme is Mr. Jos Castillo Oseja, a prominent member of the COSEP who has already suffered at the hands of the regime on many occasions, particularly during a beating by the Minister of the Interior on  April .
.The IOE emphasises that Radio Corporacin, Radio Catlica, Radio Noticias and Radio Mundial were closed down in May , and that Radio Corporacin, Radio Mundial and eight other radio stations were threatened with closure in July . Furthermore, La Prensa, already closed down for two weeks in July , regularly receives threats that it will be closed down again. According to the IOE, this proves that the Government's repressive attitude regarding information remains unchanged.
.Concerning the case of Mr. Mario Alegra, the director of COSEP's research institute sentenced to  years in prison, the IOE objects to the fact that, apart from the disregard shown for the defendant's rights during the investigation (confessions were extracted in illegal conditions), he is still in detention while the appeals court dealing with his case has still not given a verdict, though the time-limit provided for by the Criminal Code of Procedure has long since expired.
.In its communication of  January , the IOE alleges that on  January  the Government ordered the closing down, for an unlimited period, of the programme ""Seis en punto"", broadcast by Radio Corporacin. The programme is accused of having carried news concerning the dismissal of public servants from the Ministry of the Interior. According to the IOE, the news in question had already been carried by pro-government radio stations, which were not ordered closed. The IOE goes on to state that the Government was obliged to revoke this measure in view of its manifest arbitrariness.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government expresses its desire to inform the Committee of the implementation of a set of measures which have been undertaken in the country as a concrete expression of the Government's flexibility and will to promote an improvement in relations among the various social, economic and political sectors and forces in Nicaraguan society.
.In this context, the Government and the higher labour authorities have borne in mind the recommendations and suggestions made by the Governing Body at its November  Session, as well as the opinions expressed by the study mission which visited Nicaragua. The Government thus reports on various measures which were adopted in December .
.Firstly, the Government indicates that it has decided to release Mr. Carlos Humbres in spite of his proven guilt in the matter and the purely political nature of his case. The Government has thus demonstrated its flexibility and its political willingness to achieve peace, since this gesture will be appreciated by those who have participated in the aggression against Nicaragua. This is a genuine expression of the Revolution's desire to create a national consensus in which all of the forces of the country will be able to contribute to the reconstruction of the nation.
.In the same vein, the Government also released the persons involved in the violation of laws concerning public order during the Nandaime events. These releases should also be considered a concrete expression of the Government's flexibility and its readiness to support and intensify a political dialogue with all sectors of the nation in the search for a consensus to tackle the tasks of reconstruction of the country, which is currently suffering from the economic effects of hurricane ""Juana"" and the war of aggression. Although there is no doubt that the defendants violated the law, the Government has deemed it necessary to take concrete steps to create a national climate of responsible and constructive dialogue.
.The Government goes on to say that the President of the Republic, in his New Year's message appealed to all the economic, social and political sectors of the country to establish an effective dialogue on the basis of mutual co-operation so they may patriotically assume the tasks and responsibilities entailed by the current process of national reconstruction.
.Moreover, the labour authorities are currently preparing some legislative reforms which will make it possible to eliminate permanently some problems of compatibility between national laws and regulations and international labour Conventions. These legislative reforms will be implemented separately from the efforts to change the entire labour legislation by means of a new Labour Code. These efforts will obviously represent a large scale task calling for various stages of work in parallel with consultations with employers' and workers' organisations and debate in the National Assembly. The Government intends to keep the ILO informed of the progress of the efforts undertaken to change certain provisions to which the Committee of Experts and the study mission had suggested amendments.
.The Government believes that with the national efforts it is undertaking to find opportunities for constructive dialogue and consensus among the various sectors, it is offering concrete responses to the opinions, suggestions and criteria which were presented to the authorities by the Governing Body and other ILO bodies. The Government reiterates its willingness to continue to intensify the search for points of agreement among the various sectors and thus to consolidate the various expressions of tripartism currently existing in Nicaragua. As in the past, the Government will keep the ILO informed of the results obtained.
.In its communications dated  and  February , the Government points out that there are currently four Labour Code projects, one drafted by the Government and the others by various opposition movements (political parties and a central labour organisation). These projects will be presented at the next parliamentary session for debate and, possibly, adoption. The discussions concerning the Labour Code are prominent on the agenda of the next session of the National Assembly. The latter has engaged in consultations with the employers' and workers' organisations of the country. The approval of the new Labour Code has been declared a priority by the Assembly and is an item on the agenda of the - session.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour is establishing an institutional consultative body, between workers and employers without any distinction whatsoever, so that the social problems that affect them may be discussed more expeditiously.
.As regards the application of Convention No. , the Government points out that, since January , the process of tripartite consultation has been intensified in the context of national consensus. The President of the Republic, the Minister of Industry, Economy and Commerce and the Minister of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Reform had discussions with all the employers' groups in the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. They have also met with the central labour organisations with a view to defining the framework of integration for the country's economic reconstruction. These meetings have led to the adoption of a series of political and legal guarantees of private enterprise activities, the creation of joint ventures funded by the State and the private sector, and the establishment of mechanisms allowing for ongoing consultation with the agents of national economic activity. The Government is of the opinion that these initiatives created a new atmosphere of confidence. Through its leader, Mr. Gurdian, the COSEP has recommended its affiliates to participate in all discussions and meetings with the governmental authority,",0,1988,Nicaragua
107,"with a view to looking for agreement and consultative formulae.
.As regards lands confiscated from private employers, the Government states that the application of legal confiscation measures has been reduced since . In that year  properties were affected; this figure dropped to  in  and to only six in . In his address of  January  to the National Assembly, the President of the Republic announced that no more land would be confiscated, since a first phase of the agrarian reform has now been completed and the productive exploitation of the land redistributed to , farmer families must now be consolidated. According to the Government, the present land ownership structure is as follows: private property (large landowners, co-operatives, small and medium producers),  per cent; State sector,  per cent; uncultivated land,  per cent.
.Within the national consultation process defined by the Government for , and in a perspective of economic reconstruction of the country once the war will have subsided, the President of the Republic has announced to the producers and entrepreneurs that a ""legal security"" would be granted on property, with a view to establishing a better atmosphere of mutual confidence and credibility. This atmosphere is illustrated by the fact that the Government and the private consortium Nicaragua Sugar have decided to settle their differences with respect to the control of the San Antonio complex. The Government has granted a realistic indemnity to the owners, as well as a series of guarantees and support measures to other businesses providing goods and services belonging to the same economic group.
.The Government recalls in this regard that the Committee on Freedom of Association has decided several times that ""cases where legal standards on possession and ownership of land are challenged do not concern the exercise of union rights"".
.As regards the closing-down of the news programmes ""The Nicaraguan"" and ""Seis en Punto"", the Directorate of Media of the Ministry of the Interior, by resolution of  January , has accepted a request for the resumption of these two programmes, after a re-examination of the cases under the legislation in force.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that in the framework of its systematic efforts to create a climate of coexistence and social harmony among all the economic sectors, which have intensified over the last few weeks, the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, led by the Minister, have requested the President of the Republic to give special attention to the circumstances and the present stage reached in the trial against Mr. Alegra with a view to examining a measure which, while respecting the national juridical order and the full independence of the powers of the State, would demonstrate in a concrete manner the Government's desire for conciliation. This was requested independently of any factors concerning Mr. Alegra's guilt. Identical steps have been taken in Mr. Guillermo Quant's case; he is also a member of COSEP and sentenced for spying. The Government will inform the Committee of any forthcoming decisions coming from the President's Office or from any other State powers. These will probably be able to be adopted in the next few days.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that Mr. Felipe Martinez, a CUS official, was released during the last week of January.
.As regards tripartism, the Government announces that it is taking the necessary measures for the creation, in the month of March, of a special tripartite consultative commission. The first item it will have to deal with is the Convention on safety and health in construction which was recently adopted by the International Labour Conference.
.As regards the elaboration of the Labour Code already referred to in its previous communications, the Government states that the labour authorities have, during the preparation of the new Code, given special importance to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Government confirms that it will request the technical assistance of the Office.
.Moreover, the Government adds that the Accords signed by the Heads of State of Central America on  and  February have enlarged the political framework necessary for a thorough study of a package of measures to enable the efficient realisation of national consultation, involving all sectors, for the economic reconstruction of the country. As a direct consequence of the Government's wish for peace and of the Accords in question, in the coming days a broad amnesty will be adopted which will cover the repatriation or homecoming of persons linked to the activities carried out against the nation. . In its communication of  February , the Government states that, on  February, the summit meeting of Central American Presidents adopted a series of Accords which will have profound repercussions on the solution of the various problems which have been the subject of allegations before the Committee. The measures affecting internal politics proposed by the Government to contribute to peace in the region cover the whole range of legal and economic relations between the different sectors of the country and the Government. Thus, the following measures - the amendment of the election laws, the revision of the laws concerning the communications media, the change in the composition of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the decision to hold at an earlier date the national presidential, legislative and municipal elections - constitute fundamental steps which have direct consequences on the natural contradictions and problems existing between the labour sectors and the Government, opening new avenues for consultation and comprehension between them. In these circumstances, the Government considers it important that the Committee suggest conciliation measures at this present jucture so that a reasonable delay be granted enabling an examination of the functioning of the Accords and their repercussion in the labour fields, at least until June , before proposing initiatives such as a commission of inquiry which would not in any way serve the reconciliation process, but would, on the contrary, introduce tension.
.The Committee has noted the Government's replies to the various recommendations it made at its meeting in November , but must observe that these replies do not cover some of the most important points raised by the Committee.
.Regarding the legal aspect of the cases before it, the Committee notes that the Government is currently preparing the modification of certain legislative provisions which had been the subject of comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. The Government will keep the ILO informed of these amendments. In addition, the work already undertaken on the adoption of a new Labour Code is continuing. The Committee notes in particular that four Labour Code drafts will be discussed during the next parliamentary session, and that, according to the Government, consultations have been initiated with employers' and workers' organisations. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the technical assistance of the International Labour Office will be asked for in the preparation of the Code. It notes the Government's statement that special importance has been given in the draft to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Committee recalls in that respect the urgent need for the adoption of labour legislation compatible with Conventions Nos.  and , and reminds the Government that all the employers' and workers' organisations, as well as the ILO, should be involved in the drafting of this legislation.
.The Committee further notes that the Government provides no information on the measures it considers taking to adopt legislation to guarantee fully the exercise of civil liberties and broaden judicial safeguards, as the Committee recommended in November .
.The Committee takes note of the efforts reported by the Government to strengthen tripartism and create an institutional consultative body. In particular it notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special tripartite consultative commission which will examine issues linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . The Committee requests the Government to supply specific information on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.
.Regarding the confiscated lands, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government on the decrease in the number of these measures since , and the declaration of the President of the Republic to the effect that no more land would be confiscated. The Committee once again expresses hope that the Government will re-open the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossessed.
.With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these programmes have now resumed. The Committee must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media, and recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.
.Regarding the allegations concerning imprisonments, the Committee notes the release of persons arrested after the demonstration organised in Nandaime in July . The Committee had, however, considered that, because of its political character, the demonstration was",-1,1988,Nicaragua
108,"not within its competence. However, the Government has not replied to the requests made by the Committee for information on the situation of certain detained unionists. The Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad measure of amnesty in the coming days. It expresses the firm hope that this amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and it requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. The Committee also notes the Government's statement that the file concerning Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic for special examination and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.
.Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of State of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.
.The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these Accords will be able to be implemented in the shortest possible time and that their application will have favourable and immediate repercussions on the observance of the Conventions on freedom of association both in fact and in law. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the measures which the Government has to take to ensure this application should cover the elaboration and adoption of a new labour code as well as legislation guaranteeing fully the exercise of civil liberties. They should also cover the release of the leaders of employers' and workers' organisations to which the Committee attaches special importance. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply, as rapidly as possible, precise, concrete and detailed information on the measures that will be taken in this respect. In the meantime, the Committee invites the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take the appropriate preparatory measures so that the Governing Body will have before it, at its next session, proposals concerning the composition of a commission of inquiry and concerning the financial arrangements necessary for the work of this commission in the event that the Committee and the Governing Body consider the information supplied by the Government to be unsatisfactory and the Governing Body consequently decides to establish such a commission.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) As regards the legislative aspect of the cases, the Committee notes that the Government is preparing the amendment of certain legislative provisions and that four draft Labour Codes will be discussed by the National Assembly during the next sitting of Parliament. The Committee recalls the urgent need for the adoption of new labour legislation in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  and the importance of involving all the workers' and employers' organisations, as well as the ILO, in its elaboration.b) As regards the exercise of civil liberties and judicial safeguards, the Committee impresses upon the Government that legislation fully guaranteeing these liberties and broadening the legal safeguards should be adopted as soon as possible, and it requests the Government to supply information on the measures it intends to take in this regard.c) As regards tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special commission which will examine questions linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . It requests the Government to supply specific information on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.d) As regards the confiscation of land, the Committee again expresses the hope that the Government will re-open the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossessed.e) With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these have now resumed but must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media. It recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.f) Regarding the detention of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations, the Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad amnesty in the coming days. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. It also notes the Government's statement that the file of Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.g) Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of State of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.h) The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these Accords will be able to be implemented in the shortest possible time and that their application will have favourable and immediate repercussions on the observance of the Conventions on freedom of association both in fact and in law. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the measures which the Government has to take to ensure this application should cover the elaboration and adoption of a new labour code as well as legislation guaranteeing fully the exercise of civil liberties. They should also cover the release of the leaders of employers' and workers' organisations to which the Committee attaches special importance. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply, as rapidly as possible, precise, concrete and detailed information on the measures that will be taken in this respect. In the meantime, the Committee invites the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take the appropriate preparatory measures so that the Governing Body will have before it, at its next session, proposals concerning the composition of a commission of inquiry and concerning the financial arrangements necessary for the work of this commission in the event that the Committee and the Governing Body consider the information supplied by the Government to be unsatisfactory and the Governing Body consequently decides to establish such a commission.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In conformity with the invitation extended by the Government of Nicaragua in a communication dated  May , a study mission visited Nicaragua from  September to  October  (see the mission report annexed hereto).
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua which it has examined on a number of occasions. (See, in particular, the th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).) In addition, three new complaints have been presented by the ICFTU in communications dated  March,  April,  and  May, and  July , by the WCL in a communication of  August (Case No. ) and by the IOE in communications dated  June and  and  July  (Case No. ).
.In a communication of  June , several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua for infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite",0,1988,Nicaragua
109,"Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in May , the Committee invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )):(a) The Committee reminds the Government that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights, and requests it to take the necessary measures to ensure that such protection is effectively provided.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the arrest and current situation of the trade unionists Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.(c) The Committee, while noting with interest that the rights suspended by the state of emergency have been restored, requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on the resumption of activities by employers' and workers' organisations in practice, particularly as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, exercise of the right of assembly, registration of these organisations and exercise of the right to strike.(d) Noting that Decree No.  is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of voluntary collective negotiation, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this situation and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt in this connection.(e) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.(f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.The above-mentioned study mission was carried out from  September to  October  by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, accompanied by Mr. Bernard Gernigon, Chief of the ILO Freedom of Association Branch, and Mr. Christian Ramos, an official of said Branch. The report of the representative of the Director-General appears as an annex to this document.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to express its thanks to Mr. Fernando Uribe Restrepo for having undertaken this study mission as the Director-General's representative and for his detailed report on the matters pending.
.Since the complaints and the information gathered during the mission are all analysed in the report of the Director-General's representative, the Committee can proceed directly to its conclusions on the various cases.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes the report of the study mission carried out in Nicaragua and the facilities granted by the authorities to the Director-General's representative for carrying out his mission. It deplores however the fact that the Director-General's representative was not authorised to meet one of the imprisoned persons with whom the mission had asked to speak.b) The Committee requests the Government to furnish a copy of the text of the judgement that will be handed down in the case of CUS trade unionists now held at the ""Zona franca"" penitentiary compound in Managua mentioned in paragraph  above.c) The Committee requests the Government to consider the adoption of amnesty or reduced sentence measures in respect of Mr. Milton Silva Gaitn and Mr. Arcadio Ortz Espinoza, two trade unionists who were sentenced to five and six years' imprisonment.d) The Committee requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.e) The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the arrest of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above (specific facts motivating the arrests, text of the judgements, place of detention).f) As regards the arrests carried out during a hunger strike organised by the Permanent Congress of Workers, the Committee reminds the Government that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is made entails restrictions on freedom of association and that governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities receive appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of arrests being based on trade union activities.g) As regards the attacks carried out against trade union premises and the threats against trade unionists, the Committee recalls that activities of this kind create among trade unionists a climate of fear which is extremely prejudicial to the exercise of trade union activities and that the authorities, when informed of such matters, should carry out an immediate investigation to determine who is responsible and punish the guilty parties.h) As regards the measures taken following the demonstration in Nandaime, the Committee considers, in view of the political nature of this demonstration, that the matter should be examined by other international bodies which have general competence in respect of human rights.i) As regards the confiscation of property, the Committee considers that this measure appears to have been particularly biased against the COSEP leaders and members and it considers that all the provisions relating to compensation for expropriated land should be reviewed to ensure that there is real and fair compensation for the losses sustained by the landowners and that the Government should reopen the compensation files when so requested by persons who consider that they have been despoiled.j) As regards the conviction of Mr. Alegra, the Committee expresses its concern at the procedure followed in this case and at the extreme harshness of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Court of Appeal in Managua will re-examine the case with all the requisite attentiveness and impartiality. It requests the Government to furnish a copy of the decision reached by the Court of Appeal as soon as it is available.k) As regards civil liberties connected with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that unduly severe restrictions still remain and therefore requests the Government to take advantage of the peace process that has begun in Nicaragua to adopt legislation that will fully guarantee the exercise of public freedoms and broaden judicial safeguards.l) As regards tripartite consultations on international labour standards, the Committee requests the Government to set up and convene as soon as possible an advisory committee on this subject - which should be representative of all employers' and workers' organisations - and to furnish information on the setting up and meetings of this advisory committee.m) On the subject of trade union legislation, the Committee urges the Government to work with all the workers' and employers' organisations - and with the ILO as already accepted by the Government - on the drafting of the new Labour Code which it intends to prepare and it expresses the firm hope that the Government will be able to report very shortly substantial progress towards new legislation in line with Conventions Nos.  and .n) In view of the conclusions it has thus reached, the Committee observes that the situation of employers' and workers' organisations in Nicaragua gives rise to major problems in relation to several basic principles concerning freedom of association and trade union rights. The Committee accordingly considers that the Government should take concrete measures in the shortest possible time to apply fully the Conventions on freedom of association which it has ratified. These measures should cover all the problems which arise in law in relation to both the preparation of a new Labour Code and the adoption of legislation guaranteeing the full exercise of civil liberties. These legal measures should be accompanied by measures relating to factual situations, such as, in the first place, the release of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations at present in detention. Should the Government not supply, before the next meeting of the Committee in February , information demonstrating a change in attitude as regards these matters and a clear desire to make progress as regards the situation of employers' and workers' organisations, as well as their leaders and members, the Committee would consider it necessary to refer the matter to the Governing Body recommending to it the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry in conformity with article , paragraph , of the Constitution.",-1,1988,Nicaragua
110,".For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos.  and ) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. ,  and ) by the International Organisation of Employers.
.Cases Nos.  and  were last examined by the Committee at its November  meeting and Cases Nos.  and  in February . (See respectively th Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (November  and February-March ).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. .
.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated  May  (for Case No. ),  August  (for Cases Nos. , ,  and ),  January  (for Cases Nos.  and ) and  February  (for Cases Nos. ,  and ).
.In addition, in a communication of  June , several employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of ,  and  January .
.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.
.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.
.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.
.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.
.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. .) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.
.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.
.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September , the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.
.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these measures corresponded to the needs of agrarian reform. While realising that the persons mentioned in the IOE's complaint cannot take advantage of their position as COSEP leaders to evade the consequences of an agrarian reform policy, the Committee must nevertheless point out with concern that these measures have allegedly affected a large number of leaders of the employers' organisation in a discriminatory fashion. It expresses the hope that the persons in question will be fairly compensated for their losses as provided for by law.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that there is no trace of any expulsion order against Mr. Frank Bendaa, the Vice-President of COSEP. Given the contradiction between the complainants' version of the facts and that of the Government, the Committee can only recall generally, that the expulsion of leaders of employers' or workers' organisations from their country for having been involved in activities linked to their position, is not only contrary to human rights, but also interferes in the activities of the organisations to which they belong (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada) para. ).
.The Government has not made a specific reply to the requests for information concerning the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day. It confines itself to stating that no citizen was deprived of his liberty on that occasion. The Committee notes this information but regrets that the authorities banned the celebrating of this Private Enterprise Day.
.The Committee notes that the newspaper La Prensa is once again circulating freely and expresses the hope that this measure will be final. It would, indeed, recall that the right of an employers' or workers' organisation to express its opinions uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. ).
.Lastly, as concerns the suspension of the state of emergency, the Committee refers to the considerations set out hereafter concerning the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Governing Body must consider, in the present case, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry under article  of the Constitution. This complaint contains allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No.  based mainly on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional freedoms, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the absence of free collective bargaining; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the Government's failure to consult the COSEP.
.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it has adopted conclusions which were approved by the Governing Body, and which contain precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases are in a number of instances in contradiction with the allegations made by the authors of the complaints. The Committee is therefore not in a position at the moment to draw conclusions from the basis of all these cases on the general situation prevailing in Nicaragua in the freedom of association field.
.As regards the allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No. , the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts has considered whether the wage fixing system is in conformity with Article  of the Convention.
.Finally, as regards the application of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that it has indicated that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination",0,1986,Nicaragua
111,"of the representativity of workers' and employers' organisations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments.
.The Committee notes that the Government has stated that the only labour right suspended by the state of emergency is the right to strike. As regards the employers' right to organise, the Government points out that this right is recognised by the Labour Code and the regulations governing occupational associations and states that it is willing to consult the COSEP, in due course, on matters concerning international labour standards.
.Furthermore, in a more recent communication, the Government announces the suspension of the state of emergency and its willingness, subject to certain conditions, to apply the Amnesty Act. The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency for the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the possible application of the Amnesty Act. The Committee, while noting this favourable development, observes, however, that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.
.Moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations is to examine, at its next session in March , the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and  on the basis of the information supplied by the Government at the last session of the Conference to the Committee on the Application of Standards, and of the latest developments that have taken place in the country.
.The Committee considers that the Government's reply for its next session in May, together with the comments of the Committee of Experts, are elements that should be taken into consideration in determining the action to be taken on the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution. The Committee therefore decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May , on the basis of this information, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists, to which it has still not replied.b) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that instructions are given so that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and that provision is made for effective punishment where there is evidence of such treatment.c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that searches of trade union premises are carried out only on orders from an ordinary court. It requests the Government to indicate whether a warrant was in fact issued for the search of the CTN premises.d) The Committee, while noting that the expropriation of land and assets belonging to the leaders of the COSEP is, according to the Government, part of an agrarian reform, notes with concern that these measures have allegedly affected in a discriminatory way a large number of COSEP leaders. It expresses the hope that the persons concerned will be fairly compensated for their losses in accordance with the law.e) The Committee once again deplores the fact that the authorities banned celebration of Private Enterprise Day, organised by the COSEP.f) The Committee notes that the trade union review of the CUS and the newspaper La Prensa can again be published and circulated and expresses the hope that these measures will be final. It would indeed draw the Government's attention to the principle that the right to express opinions through the press without previous authorisation is one of the essential elements of the rights of workers' and employers' organisations.g) The Committee notes that the Government has announced the lifting of the state of emergency. It requests the Government to supply detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency as regards the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the situation concerning the possible application of the Amnesty Act. However, the Committee observes that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.h) The Committee decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May  the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry in response to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, on the basis of the information which will be supplied by the Government and the comments which will be formulated by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and . Geneva,  February . Roberto Ago, Chairman.",-1,1986,Nicaragua
112,".The complaint submitted by the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) dates from  February . In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee addressed to it an urgent appeal to send its observations on this case and pointed out, at its March  meeting, that, in view of the time which had elapsed since the complaint was presented, it might present a report at its next meeting on the substance of the case even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  February , transmitted to the Government on  February, the IOE points out that, on  January, the Communications Board of the Ministry of the Interior banned the daily newspaper La Prensa from publishing, at the request of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP), the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association on Case No. , approved by the Governing Body. This case concerned the ban imposed on the President of COSEP to go to a seminar organised by the ILO in Mexico in December  and the removal of pages from his passport for this purpose.
.Furthermore, the IOE recalls, regarding its  complaint alleging infringements of freedom of information by the Government (Case No. ), that the Committee on Freedom of Association had at the time asserted that ""the publication and distribution of news and information of trade union interest constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures for their control may involve a serious interference by the administrative authorities"" (th Report). According to the IOE, the Government's repeated interferences illustrate the lack of importance it attaches to freedom of information, which COSEP should enjoy, and to the conclusions of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body.
.In reply to the Committee's request for observations from the Government on the cases pending, in particular on Case No. , the Government, in a telegram dated  September , asked the ILO for details on the various outstanding cases and, in a subsequent telegram dated  October , pointed out that it was unaware of the content of the complaint concerning Case No. .
.The ILO therefore once again communicated the contents of the complaint to the Permanent Representative of Nicaragua to the United Nations Office in Geneva on  October ,  January and  April . It also sent the contents of the complaint to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Managua, on  April .
.Since that time, the Government has not submitted any further comments.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not communicated its observations in spite of the requests and the urgent appeal made to it for a reply to the allegations made by the complainant organisation.
.The Committee considers it useful to remind the Government that the purpose of the examination of complaints is to guarantee respect for freedom of association in law and in fact, and that if this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance of submitting detailed replies to such allegations so that there might be an objective examination of them. In this respect, the Committee is of the opinion that the co-operation of governments in shedding light on the issues brought before the Committee by complainants can only serve to strengthen the full respect of freedom of association and the normal development of employers' and workers' organisations.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that, according to the allegations, the Government banned the daily newspaper La Prensa from publishing, at COSEP's request, the recommendations previously adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association on Case No. .
.In the absence of a denial from the Government concerning this allegation and having examined a document issued by the Communications Board of the Ministry of the Interior in Managua on  January , and attached to the complaint, in which this Board asks the newspaper La Prensa not to publish the article entitled ""The ILO asks for guarantees for workers"" in its daily issue, the Committee can only regret this censorship imposed by the Government.
.The Committee considers it necessary to draw the Government's attention once again to the fact that workers' and employers' organisations can only develop in a system which respects and guarantees basic human rights. Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to take steps to guarantee fully the right of employers' and workers' organisations to publish and distribute their information.
.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendation:The Committee urges the Government to respect, in line with the requests made by the International Labour Conference in the  resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the right of employers' and workers' organisations to publish and distribute their information.",0,1986,Nicaragua
113,".For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos.  and ) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. ,  and ) by the International Organisation of Employers.

Geneva,  February . Roberto Ago, Chairman.
.The Committee examined Cases Nos.  (presented by the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour) and  (presented by International Organisation of Employers) at its November  meeting (see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings of November , February  and November . (See th Report, paras.  to ; rd Report, paras.  to  and ; and st Report, paras.  to , of November , February-March , and November , respectively.)
.Subsequently, the Government sent certain observations in communications dated  and  January . The International Organisation of Employers sent additional information concerning Case No.  in a communication of  January .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that according to the pertinent legislation, the anti-Somoza people's courts are special or extraordinary tribunals which handle summary proceedings entailing a number of significant restrictions on the rights of defendants. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that according to the legislation involved, the crimes over which the anti-Somoza people's courts have jurisdiction, in principle, have no bearing on the exercise of trade union rights or activities. Noting however the contradiction on this point between the complainant and the Government, the Committee again asks the Government to supply copies of the judgements of these courts concerning the persons mentioned by the complainants. The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the allegations made in Case No. .
.As regards the declaration of the state of emergency contained in Decree No.  of  January , the Committee takes note of the important motives invoked by the Government, and of the restrictions which that situation implies in the exercise of certain fundamental public freedoms and trade union rights, as noted by one of the complainant organisations. In this respect, the Committee notes that the restrictions previously examined in Cases Nos.  and , contrary to the Government's letter of  January , are not limited to counter-revolutionary activities. The Committee has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency (see, for example, st Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ), while recommending that in the event of states of siege or emergency, as regards its relations with employers' and workers' organisations and their representatives, the Government should as far as possible rely on measures provided for in ordinary law rather than on emergency measures which are liable, by their very nature, to involve certain restrictions on fundamental rights (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ).
.For its part, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has emphasised that the freedom of association Conventions do not contain any provision permitting derogation from the obligations arising under the Convention, or any suspension of their application, based on a plea that an emergency exists (see General Survey, Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, Report III, Part IV(B), International Labour Conference, th Session, , para. ). Given that the state of emergency has continued over a period of several years, entailing serious restrictions on trade union rights and public freedoms that are essential for the exercise of such rights, the Committee again expresses the firm hope that the state of emergency will be lifted in the near future. Although it recognises the existence of extremely grave circumstances in Nicaragua, the Committee considers that a return to normality in trade union life would be facilitated, in any case, by limiting the application of the state of emergency to certain geographical areas. At least, it is necessary to safeguard the exercise of specifically trade union rights such as the establishment of employers' and workers' organisations, the right to hold trade union meetings in trade union premises, and the right to strike in non-essential services.
.Lastly, the Committee notes",-1,1985,Nicaragua
115,"that the Government has not sent its observations on the allegation pending in connection with Case No. .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to lift the state of emergency in the near future. In the meantime, it requests the Government to limit its application to certain geographical areas. In any case, it is necessary to safeguard the exercise of specifically trade union rights such as the right to organise, the right to meet on trade union premises, and the right to strike in non-essential services.b) With a view to this, it requests the Government, in its relations with employers' and workers' organisations, to rely on measures provided for in ordinary law rather than on emergency measures.c) It requests the Government to send its observations and supply the information requested by the Committee during its previous examination of these cases as regards issues still pending, in particular copies of the judgements of the anti-Somoza people's courts concerning the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants.
.The Committee last examined cases ,  and  at its November  meeting (see st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )).
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  (presented by the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour) at its November  and February  meetings.

.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) In the first place, the Committee expresses its concern at the gravity of the allegations made by employers' and workers' organisations concerning, in particular, the detention and sentencing of trade unionists and the interference by the authorities in the activities of the occupational organisations.(b) As regards Case No.  the Committee urges the Government to transmit information on certain aspects of the case, as well as the judgements handed down or which will be handed down by the People's anti-Somoza tribunals, concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above. Noting that the People's anti-Somoza tribunals have been created specially by an emergency decree in April  the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with political or . common law crimes which the Government considers are unrelated to trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried promptly by independent and impartial judicial body. The Committee also requests the Government to transmit the text of the law instituting the People's anti-Somoza tribunals.(c) With respect to Case No. , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union officials and trade unionists of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(d) As regards Case No. , the Committee regrets that, in spite of several requests, the Government has not specifically referred to the allegations of one of the complainants which, on the basis of evidence, accused public officials of having been involved in these incidents and the police of having done nothing to prevent the aggression against the members of the CUS and the destruction of its offices. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that the public authorities are bound, in accordance with Convention No. , to refrain from any interference in the activities and internal workings of trade unions.(e) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments of the trial under way against five trade unionists for having stolen cattle, and asks it to send observations on the trade unions to which it failed to refer and which, according to the ICFTU, were arrested (Eduardo Gutirrez, Juan Gaitn and Enrique Flores). The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the allegation that the children, wives and mothers of the detained trade unionists were threatened with imprisonment if their husbands or children did not give up their CUS membership and that they are constantly visited by police who threaten them and help themselves to toiletries and foodstuffs.(f) Finally, the Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations contained in one of the complainants' communications dated  and  January  (banning of the CUS trade union review; the fact that CUS trade unionists are summoned to appear by the State Security Police Force, and are subjected to pressure and threatened; visits of a delegation of officials to organisations belonging to the CUS in the northern, southern and western areas of the country and warnings to the members that if there were any meetings in the future, those involved would go to prison and that this ban also extended to the setting up of new trade union organisations). The Committee requests the Government to furnish information on these aspects of the case.(g) As regards Case No. , the Committee notes that the Government has sent certain information on only one of the numerous allegations. Since the object of all the allegations in this case is to show a discriminatory attitude by the Government against COSEP, the Committee postpones the examination of the case and requests the Government to provide a reply urgently on those aspects of the case to which it has not referred.(h) As regards Case no. , the Committee regrets that the authorities prohibited the holding of the ""Private Enterprise Day"" on  November , organised by COSEP, and expresses the hope that in future this employers' organisation will be able to determine without any interference the date and activities of the Private Enterprise Day.(i) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the right of occupational organisations to hold meetings in their premises without advance authorisation and without interference by the authorities is a fundamental aspect of freedom of association.(j) The Committee also notes that according to the Government, on  and  September  no one was arrested for matters related directly with the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically whether the president of COSEP was placed under house arrest on  September  (""Private Enterprise Day""), as alleged by the complainant and, if so, the reasons.(k) The Committee observes that Decrees Nos.  and  proclaiming a state of national emergency with the subsequent restrictions on civil and trade union freedoms should have expired at the end of October . The Committee expresses the firm hope that these restrictions will not be re- imposed and requests the Government to furnish information on the subject.",-1,1985,Nicaragua
116,".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of trade union rights and freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as well as the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented in virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua. In addition, in a communication of  June  several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua, of infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has examined these questions on several occasions, most recently in November  (see st Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )) on the basis of information compiled on the spot from  September to  October  by a study mission conducted by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.Since then, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) has submitted new allegations in communications of  December  and  January . The Government supplied its observations in communications dated  January and , , ,  and  February .
.In its communication of  December , the IOE alleges that on  October  the Ministry of the Interior banned, for an unlimited period, the radio programme broadcast on Radio Mundial by the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), entitled ""The Nicaraguan"". According to the IOE, this programme reviews the main features of the economic and social situation of the country and suggests possible solutions in which the COSEP and its members would like to co-operate.
.Moreover, the IOE notes that on  November , also by order of the Ministry of the Interior, the programme ""Seis en Punto"" broadcast by Radio Corporacin was banned indefinitely. The IOE points out that the Director of Radio Corporacin and of the banned programme is Mr. Jos Castillo Oseja, a prominent member of the COSEP who has already suffered at the hands of the regime on many occasions, particularly during a beating by the Minister of the Interior on  April .
.The IOE emphasises that Radio Corporacin, Radio Catlica, Radio Noticias and Radio Mundial were closed down in May , and that Radio Corporacin, Radio Mundial and eight other radio stations were threatened with closure in July . Furthermore, La Prensa, already closed down for two weeks in July , regularly receives threats that it will be closed down again. According to the IOE, this proves that the Government's repressive attitude regarding information remains unchanged.
.Concerning the case of Mr. Mario Alegra, the director of COSEP's research institute sentenced to  years in prison, the IOE objects to the fact that, apart from the disregard shown for the defendant's rights during the investigation (confessions were extracted in illegal conditions), he is still in detention while the appeals court dealing with his case has still not given a verdict, though the time-limit provided for by the Criminal Code of Procedure has long since expired.
.In its communication of  January , the IOE alleges that on  January  the Government ordered the closing down, for an unlimited period, of the programme ""Seis en punto"", broadcast by Radio Corporacin. The programme is accused of having carried news concerning the dismissal of public servants from the Ministry of the Interior. According to the IOE, the news in question had already been carried by pro-government radio stations, which were not ordered closed. The IOE goes on to state that the Government was obliged to revoke this measure in view of its manifest arbitrariness.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government expresses its desire to inform the Committee of the implementation of a set of measures which have been undertaken in the country as a concrete expression of the Government's flexibility and will to promote an improvement in relations among the various social, economic and political sectors and forces in Nicaraguan society.
.In this context, the Government and the higher labour authorities have borne in mind the recommendations and suggestions made by the Governing Body at its November  Session, as well as the opinions expressed by the study mission which visited Nicaragua. The Government thus reports on various measures which were adopted in December .
.Firstly, the Government indicates that it has decided to release Mr. Carlos Humbres in spite of his proven guilt in the matter and the purely political nature of his case. The Government has thus demonstrated its flexibility and its political willingness to achieve peace, since this gesture will be appreciated by those who have participated in the aggression against Nicaragua. This is a genuine expression of the Revolution's desire to create a national consensus in which all of the forces of the country will be able to contribute to the reconstruction of the nation.
.In the same vein, the Government also released the persons involved in the violation of laws concerning public order during the Nandaime events. These releases should also be considered a concrete expression of the Government's flexibility and its readiness to support and intensify a political dialogue with all sectors of the nation in the search for a consensus to tackle the tasks of reconstruction of the country, which is currently suffering from the economic effects of hurricane ""Juana"" and the war of aggression. Although there is no doubt that the defendants violated the law, the Government has deemed it necessary to take concrete steps to create a national climate of responsible and constructive dialogue.
.The Government goes on to say that the President of the Republic, in his New Year's message appealed to all the economic, social and political sectors of the country to establish an effective dialogue on the basis of mutual co-operation so they may patriotically assume the tasks and responsibilities entailed by the current process of national reconstruction.
.Moreover, the labour authorities are currently preparing some legislative reforms which will make it possible to eliminate permanently some problems of compatibility between national laws and regulations and international labour Conventions. These legislative reforms will be implemented separately from the efforts to change the entire labour legislation by means of a new Labour Code. These efforts will obviously represent a large scale task calling for various stages of work in parallel with consultations with employers' and workers' organisations and debate in the National Assembly. The Government intends to keep the ILO informed of the progress of the efforts undertaken to change certain provisions to which the Committee of Experts and the study mission had suggested amendments.
.The Government believes that with the national efforts it is undertaking to find opportunities for constructive dialogue and consensus among the various sectors, it is offering concrete responses to the opinions, suggestions and criteria which were presented to the authorities by the Governing Body and other ILO bodies. The Government reiterates its willingness to continue to intensify the search for points of agreement among the various sectors and thus to consolidate the various expressions of tripartism currently existing in Nicaragua. As in the past, the Government will keep the ILO informed of the results obtained.
.In its communications dated  and  February , the Government points out that there are currently four Labour Code projects, one drafted by the Government and the others by various opposition movements (political parties and a central labour organisation). These projects will be presented at the next parliamentary session for debate and, possibly, adoption. The discussions concerning the Labour Code are prominent on the agenda of the next session of the National Assembly. The latter has engaged in consultations with the employers' and workers' organisations of the country. The approval of the new Labour Code has been declared a priority by the Assembly and is an item on the agenda of the - session.
.The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour is establishing an institutional consultative body, between workers and employers without any distinction whatsoever, so that the social problems that affect them may be discussed more expeditiously.
.As regards",0,1985,Nicaragua
117,"the application of Convention No. , the Government points out that, since January , the process of tripartite consultation has been intensified in the context of national consensus. The President of the Republic, the Minister of Industry, Economy and Commerce and the Minister of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Reform had discussions with all the employers' groups in the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. They have also met with the central labour organisations with a view to defining the framework of integration for the country's economic reconstruction. These meetings have led to the adoption of a series of political and legal guarantees of private enterprise activities, the creation of joint ventures funded by the State and the private sector, and the establishment of mechanisms allowing for ongoing consultation with the agents of national economic activity. The Government is of the opinion that these initiatives created a new atmosphere of confidence. Through its leader, Mr. Gurdian, the COSEP has recommended its affiliates to participate in all discussions and meetings with the governmental authority, with a view to looking for agreement and consultative formulae.
.As regards lands confiscated from private employers, the Government states that the application of legal confiscation measures has been reduced since . In that year  properties were affected; this figure dropped to  in  and to only six in . In his address of  January  to the National Assembly, the President of the Republic announced that no more land would be confiscated, since a first phase of the agrarian reform has now been completed and the productive exploitation of the land redistributed to , farmer families must now be consolidated. According to the Government, the present land ownership structure is as follows: private property (large landowners, co-operatives, small and medium producers),  per cent; State sector,  per cent; uncultivated land,  per cent.
.Within the national consultation process defined by the Government for , and in a perspective of economic reconstruction of the country once the war will have subsided, the President of the Republic has announced to the producers and entrepreneurs that a ""legal security"" would be granted on property, with a view to establishing a better atmosphere of mutual confidence and credibility. This atmosphere is illustrated by the fact that the Government and the private consortium Nicaragua Sugar have decided to settle their differences with respect to the control of the San Antonio complex. The Government has granted a realistic indemnity to the owners, as well as a series of guarantees and support measures to other businesses providing goods and services belonging to the same economic group.
.The Government recalls in this regard that the Committee on Freedom of Association has decided several times that ""cases where legal standards on possession and ownership of land are challenged do not concern the exercise of union rights"".
.As regards the closing-down of the news programmes ""The Nicaraguan"" and ""Seis en Punto"", the Directorate of Media of the Ministry of the Interior, by resolution of  January , has accepted a request for the resumption of these two programmes, after a re-examination of the cases under the legislation in force.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that in the framework of its systematic efforts to create a climate of coexistence and social harmony among all the economic sectors, which have intensified over the last few weeks, the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, led by the Minister, have requested the President of the Republic to give special attention to the circumstances and the present stage reached in the trial against Mr. Alegra with a view to examining a measure which, while respecting the national juridical order and the full independence of the powers of the State, would demonstrate in a concrete manner the Government's desire for conciliation. This was requested independently of any factors concerning Mr. Alegra's guilt. Identical steps have been taken in Mr. Guillermo Quant's case; he is also a member of COSEP and sentenced for spying. The Government will inform the Committee of any forthcoming decisions coming from the President's Office or from any other State powers. These will probably be able to be adopted in the next few days.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that Mr. Felipe Martinez, a CUS official, was released during the last week of January.
.As regards tripartism, the Government announces that it is taking the necessary measures for the creation, in the month of March, of a special tripartite consultative commission. The first item it will have to deal with is the Convention on safety and health in construction which was recently adopted by the International Labour Conference.
.As regards the elaboration of the Labour Code already referred to in its previous communications, the Government states that the labour authorities have, during the preparation of the new Code, given special importance to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Government confirms that it will request the technical assistance of the Office.
.Moreover, the Government adds that the Accords signed by the Heads of State of Central America on  and  February have enlarged the political framework necessary for a thorough study of a package of measures to enable the efficient realisation of national consultation, involving all sectors, for the economic reconstruction of the country. As a direct consequence of the Government's wish for peace and of the Accords in question, in the coming days a broad amnesty will be adopted which will cover the repatriation or homecoming of persons linked to the activities carried out against the nation. . In its communication of  February , the Government states that, on  February, the summit meeting of Central American Presidents adopted a series of Accords which will have profound repercussions on the solution of the various problems which have been the subject of allegations before the Committee. The measures affecting internal politics proposed by the Government to contribute to peace in the region cover the whole range of legal and economic relations between the different sectors of the country and the Government. Thus, the following measures - the amendment of the election laws, the revision of the laws concerning the communications media, the change in the composition of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the decision to hold at an earlier date the national presidential, legislative and municipal elections - constitute fundamental steps which have direct consequences on the natural contradictions and problems existing between the labour sectors and the Government, opening new avenues for consultation and comprehension between them. In these circumstances, the Government considers it important that the Committee suggest conciliation measures at this present jucture so that a reasonable delay be granted enabling an examination of the functioning of the Accords and their repercussion in the labour fields, at least until June , before proposing initiatives such as a commission of inquiry which would not in any way serve the reconciliation process, but would, on the contrary, introduce tension.
.The Committee has noted the Government's replies to the various recommendations it made at its meeting in November , but must observe that these replies do not cover some of the most important points raised by the Committee.
.Regarding the legal aspect of the cases before it, the Committee notes that the Government is currently preparing the modification of certain legislative provisions which had been the subject of comments by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. The Government will keep the ILO informed of these amendments. In addition, the work already undertaken on the adoption of a new Labour Code is continuing. The Committee notes in particular that four Labour Code drafts will be discussed during the next parliamentary session, and that, according to the Government, consultations have been initiated with employers' and workers' organisations. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the technical assistance of the International Labour Office will be asked for in the preparation of the Code. It notes the Government's statement that special importance has been given in the draft to the legal guarantees and safeguards for the full exercise of freedom of association. The Committee recalls in that respect the urgent need for the adoption of labour legislation compatible with Conventions Nos.  and , and reminds the Government that all the employers' and workers' organisations, as well as the ILO, should be involved in the drafting of this legislation.
.The Committee further notes that the Government provides no information on the measures it considers taking to adopt legislation to guarantee fully the exercise of civil liberties and broaden judicial safeguards, as the Committee recommended in November .
.The Committee takes note of the efforts reported by the Government to strengthen tripartism and create an institutional consultative body. In particular it notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special tripartite consultative commission which will examine issues linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . The Committee requests the Government to supply specific information",-1,1985,Nicaragua
118,"on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.
.Regarding the confiscated lands, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government on the decrease in the number of these measures since , and the declaration of the President of the Republic to the effect that no more land would be confiscated. The Committee once again expresses hope that the Government will re-open the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossessed.
.With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these programmes have now resumed. The Committee must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media, and recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.
.Regarding the allegations concerning imprisonments, the Committee notes the release of persons arrested after the demonstration organised in Nandaime in July . The Committee had, however, considered that, because of its political character, the demonstration was not within its competence. However, the Government has not replied to the requests made by the Committee for information on the situation of certain detained unionists. The Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad measure of amnesty in the coming days. It expresses the firm hope that this amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and it requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. The Committee also notes the Government's statement that the file concerning Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic for special examination and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.
.Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of State of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.
.The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State. The Committee expresses the firm hope that these Accords will be able to be implemented in the shortest possible time and that their application will have favourable and immediate repercussions on the observance of the Conventions on freedom of association both in fact and in law. In this respect, the Committee recalls that the measures which the Government has to take to ensure this application should cover the elaboration and adoption of a new labour code as well as legislation guaranteeing fully the exercise of civil liberties. They should also cover the release of the leaders of employers' and workers' organisations to which the Committee attaches special importance. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply, as rapidly as possible, precise, concrete and detailed information on the measures that will be taken in this respect. In the meantime, the Committee invites the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take the appropriate preparatory measures so that the Governing Body will have before it, at its next session, proposals concerning the composition of a commission of inquiry and concerning the financial arrangements necessary for the work of this commission in the event that the Committee and the Governing Body consider the information supplied by the Government to be unsatisfactory and the Governing Body consequently decides to establish such a commission.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) As regards the legislative aspect of the cases, the Committee notes that the Government is preparing the amendment of certain legislative provisions and that four draft Labour Codes will be discussed by the National Assembly during the next sitting of Parliament. The Committee recalls the urgent need for the adoption of new labour legislation in conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  and the importance of involving all the workers' and employers' organisations, as well as the ILO, in its elaboration.b) As regards the exercise of civil liberties and judicial safeguards, the Committee impresses upon the Government that legislation fully guaranteeing these liberties and broadening the legal safeguards should be adopted as soon as possible, and it requests the Government to supply information on the measures it intends to take in this regard.c) As regards tripartite consultations, the Committee notes that the Government envisages the creation of a special commission which will examine questions linked to international labour standards as of the month of March . It requests the Government to supply specific information on the composition of this commission and on developments in its work.d) As regards the confiscation of land, the Committee again expresses the hope that the Government will re-open the compensation files at the request of those who consider they have been unfairly dispossessed.e) With respect to the closing-down of radio news programmes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these have now resumed but must express its concern at the frequency of suspension measures imposed on the media. It recalls the importance of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to express their opinions through the media.f) Regarding the detention of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations, the Committee notes that the Government states that it wants to adopt a broad amnesty in the coming days. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the amnesty will cover all detained leaders of employers' and workers' organisations and requests the Government to supply detailed information on the scope of this measure and on the persons affected by it. It also notes the Government's statement that the file of Mr. Alegra, the director of a COSEP research institute, has been submitted to the President of the Republic and it trusts that this will lead to his rapid release.g) Having thus examined the various questions pending in this matter, the Committee notes with interest that the Accords concluded during the very recent summit of the Heads of State of Central America should, if they are followed up, result in progress in the general situation in Nicaragua which might bring about a positive development in the issues before the Committee.h) The Committee is conscious of the fact that, in view of the extremely recent date of these Accords, the Government has not yet been able to supply information documenting the concrete measures taken following the summit of the Central American Heads of State.

.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In conformity with the invitation extended by the Government of Nicaragua in a communication dated  May , a study mission visited Nicaragua from  September to  October  (see the mission report annexed hereto).
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has",1,1985,Nicaragua
119,"had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua which it has examined on a number of occasions. (See, in particular, the th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).) In addition, three new complaints have been presented by the ICFTU in communications dated  March,  April,  and  May, and  July , by the WCL in a communication of  August (Case No. ) and by the IOE in communications dated  June and  and  July  (Case No. ).
.In a communication of  June , several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua for infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in May , the Committee invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )):(a) The Committee reminds the Government that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights, and requests it to take the necessary measures to ensure that such protection is effectively provided.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the arrest and current situation of the trade unionists Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.(c) The Committee, while noting with interest that the rights suspended by the state of emergency have been restored, requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on the resumption of activities by employers' and workers' organisations in practice, particularly as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, exercise of the right of assembly, registration of these organisations and exercise of the right to strike.(d) Noting that Decree No.  is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of voluntary collective negotiation, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this situation and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt in this connection.(e) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.(f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.The above-mentioned study mission was carried out from  September to  October  by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, accompanied by Mr. Bernard Gernigon, Chief of the ILO Freedom of Association Branch, and Mr. Christian Ramos, an official of said Branch. The report of the representative of the Director-General appears as an annex to this document.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to express its thanks to Mr. Fernando Uribe Restrepo for having undertaken this study mission as the Director-General's representative and for his detailed report on the matters pending.
.Since the complaints and the information gathered during the mission are all analysed in the report of the Director-General's representative, the Committee can proceed directly to its conclusions on the various cases.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes the report of the study mission carried out in Nicaragua and the facilities granted by the authorities to the Director-General's representative for carrying out his mission. It deplores however the fact that the Director-General's representative was not authorised to meet one of the imprisoned persons with whom the mission had asked to speak.b) The Committee requests the Government to furnish a copy of the text of the judgement that will be handed down in the case of CUS trade unionists now held at the ""Zona franca"" penitentiary compound in Managua mentioned in paragraph  above.c) The Committee requests the Government to consider the adoption of amnesty or reduced sentence measures in respect of Mr. Milton Silva Gaitn and Mr. Arcadio Ortz Espinoza, two trade unionists who were sentenced to five and six years' imprisonment.d) The Committee requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.e) The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the arrest of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above (specific facts motivating the arrests, text of the judgements, place of detention).f) As regards the arrests carried out during a hunger strike organised by the Permanent Congress of Workers, the Committee reminds the Government that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is made entails restrictions on freedom of association and that governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities receive appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of arrests being based on trade union activities.g) As regards the attacks carried out against trade union premises and the threats against trade unionists, the Committee recalls that activities of this kind create among trade unionists a climate of fear which is extremely prejudicial to the exercise of trade union activities and that the authorities, when informed of such matters, should carry out an immediate investigation to determine who is responsible and punish the guilty parties.h) As regards the measures taken following the demonstration in Nandaime, the Committee considers, in view of the political nature of this demonstration, that the matter should be examined by other international bodies which have general competence in respect of human rights.i) As regards the confiscation of property, the Committee considers that this measure appears to have been particularly biased against the COSEP leaders and members and it considers that all the provisions relating to compensation for expropriated land should be reviewed to ensure that there is real and fair compensation for the losses sustained by the landowners and that the Government should reopen the compensation files when so requested by persons who consider that they have been despoiled.j) As regards the conviction of Mr. Alegra, the Committee expresses its concern at the procedure followed in this case and at the extreme harshness of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Court of Appeal in Managua will re-examine the case with all the requisite attentiveness and impartiality. It requests the Government to furnish a copy of the decision reached by the Court of Appeal as soon as it is available.k) As regards civil liberties connected with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that unduly severe restrictions still remain and therefore requests the Government to take advantage of the peace process that has begun in Nicaragua to adopt legislation that will fully guarantee the exercise of public freedoms and broaden judicial safeguards.l) As regards tripartite consultations on international labour standards, the Committee requests the Government to set up and convene as soon as possible an advisory committee on this subject - which should be representative of all employers' and workers' organisations - and to furnish information on the setting up and meetings of this advisory committee.m) On the subject of trade union legislation, the Committee urges the Government to work with all the workers' and employers' organisations - and with the ILO as already accepted by the Government - on the drafting of the new Labour Code which it intends to prepare and it expresses the firm hope that the Government will be able to report very shortly substantial progress towards new legislation in line with Conventions Nos.  and .n) In view of the conclusions it has thus reached, the Committee observes that the situation of employers' and workers' organisations in Nicaragua gives rise to major problems in relation to several basic principles concerning freedom of association and trade union rights. The Committee accordingly considers that the Government should take concrete measures in the shortest possible time to apply fully the Conventions on freedom of association which it has ratified. These measures should cover all the",0,1985,Nicaragua
120,"problems which arise in law in relation to both the preparation of a new Labour Code and the adoption of legislation guaranteeing the full exercise of civil liberties. These legal measures should be accompanied by measures relating to factual situations, such as, in the first place, the release of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations at present in detention. Should the Government not supply, before the next meeting of the Committee in February , information demonstrating a change in attitude as regards these matters and a clear desire to make progress as regards the situation of employers' and workers' organisations, as well as their leaders and members, the Committee would consider it necessary to refer the matter to the Governing Body recommending to it the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry in conformity with article , paragraph , of the Constitution.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos.  and ) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. ,  and ) by the International Organisation of Employers.
.Cases Nos.  and  were last examined by the Committee at its November  meeting and Cases Nos.  and  in February . (See respectively th Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (November  and February-March ).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. .
.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated  May  (for Case No. ),  August  (for Cases Nos. , ,  and ),  January  (for Cases Nos.  and ) and  February  (for Cases Nos. ,  and ).
.In addition, in a communication of  June , several employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of ,  and  January .
.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.
.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.
.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.
.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.
.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. .) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.
.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.
.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September , the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.
.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these measures corresponded to the needs of agrarian reform. While realising that the persons mentioned in the IOE's complaint cannot take advantage of their position as COSEP leaders to evade the consequences of an agrarian reform policy, the Committee must nevertheless point out with concern that these measures have allegedly affected a large number of leaders of the employers' organisation in a discriminatory fashion. It expresses the hope that the persons in question will be fairly compensated for their losses as provided for by law.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that there is no trace of any expulsion order against Mr. Frank Bendaa, the Vice-President of COSEP. Given the contradiction between the complainants' version of the facts and that of the Government, the Committee can only recall generally, that the expulsion of leaders of employers' or workers' organisations from their country for having been involved in activities linked to their position, is not only contrary to human rights, but also interferes in the activities of the organisations to which they belong (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada) para. ).
.The Government has not made a specific reply to the requests for information concerning the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day. It confines itself to stating that no citizen was deprived of his liberty on that occasion. The Committee notes this information but regrets that the authorities banned the celebrating of this Private Enterprise Day.
.The Committee notes that the newspaper La Prensa is once again circulating freely and expresses the hope that this measure will be final. It would, indeed, recall that the right of an employers' or workers' organisation to express its opinions uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. ).
.Lastly, as concerns the suspension of the state of emergency, the Committee refers to the considerations set out hereafter concerning the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Governing Body must consider, in the present case, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry under article  of the Constitution. This complaint contains allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No.  based mainly on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional freedoms, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the absence of free collective bargaining; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the Government's failure to consult the COSEP.
.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it has adopted conclusions which",0,1985,Nicaragua
121,"were approved by the Governing Body, and which contain precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases are in a number of instances in contradiction with the allegations made by the authors of the complaints. The Committee is therefore not in a position at the moment to draw conclusions from the basis of all these cases on the general situation prevailing in Nicaragua in the freedom of association field.
.As regards the allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No. , the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts has considered whether the wage fixing system is in conformity with Article  of the Convention.
.Finally, as regards the application of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that it has indicated that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organisations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments.
.The Committee notes that the Government has stated that the only labour right suspended by the state of emergency is the right to strike. As regards the employers' right to organise, the Government points out that this right is recognised by the Labour Code and the regulations governing occupational associations and states that it is willing to consult the COSEP, in due course, on matters concerning international labour standards.
.Furthermore, in a more recent communication, the Government announces the suspension of the state of emergency and its willingness, subject to certain conditions, to apply the Amnesty Act. The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency for the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the possible application of the Amnesty Act. The Committee, while noting this favourable development, observes, however, that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.
.Moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations is to examine, at its next session in March , the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and  on the basis of the information supplied by the Government at the last session of the Conference to the Committee on the Application of Standards, and of the latest developments that have taken place in the country.
.The Committee considers that the Government's reply for its next session in May, together with the comments of the Committee of Experts, are elements that should be taken into consideration in determining the action to be taken on the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution. The Committee therefore decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May , on the basis of this information, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists, to which it has still not replied.b) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that instructions are given so that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and that provision is made for effective punishment where there is evidence of such treatment.c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that searches of trade union premises are carried out only on orders from an ordinary court. It requests the Government to indicate whether a warrant was in fact issued for the search of the CTN premises.d) The Committee, while noting that the expropriation of land and assets belonging to the leaders of the COSEP is, according to the Government, part of an agrarian reform, notes with concern that these measures have allegedly affected in a discriminatory way a large number of COSEP leaders. It expresses the hope that the persons concerned will be fairly compensated for their losses in accordance with the law.e) The Committee once again deplores the fact that the authorities banned celebration of Private Enterprise Day, organised by the COSEP.f) The Committee notes that the trade union review of the CUS and the newspaper La Prensa can again be published and circulated and expresses the hope that these measures will be final. It would indeed draw the Government's attention to the principle that the right to express opinions through the press without previous authorisation is one of the essential elements of the rights of workers' and employers' organisations.g) The Committee notes that the Government has announced the lifting of the state of emergency. It requests the Government to supply detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency as regards the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the situation concerning the possible application of the Amnesty Act. However, the Committee observes that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.h) The Committee decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May  the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry in response to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, on the basis of the information which will be supplied by the Government and the comments which will be formulated by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and . Geneva,  February . Roberto Ago, Chairman.
.The Committee last examined cases ,  and  at its November  meeting (see st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )).
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  (presented by the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour) at its November  and February  meetings. (See th Report, paras.  to , and rd Report, paras.  to  and , approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions in November  and February-March , respectively.) The World Confederation of Labour sent new allegations in a communication dated  November .
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labour) has already been examined by the Committee on four occasions: March , March and June  and March . (See nd, rd, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body.)
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) was examined in February-March  and was the subject of an interim report approved by the Governing Body. (th Report, paras.  to .) At a later date, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  and  January and  and  March .
.The complaints concerning Cases Nos.  and  appear in communications from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) of  July (Case No. ) and  October  (Case No. ). With regard to the first case, the E sent additional information in a communication dated  August .
.The Government replied in communications dated  and  November ,  January,  February,  and  May and  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) In the first place, the Committee expresses its concern at the gravity of the allegations made by employers' and workers' organisations concerning, in particular, the detention and sentencing of trade unionists and the interference by the authorities in the activities of the occupational organisations.(b) As regards Case No.  the Committee urges the Government to transmit information on certain aspects of the case, as well as the judgements handed down or which will be handed down by the People's anti-Somoza tribunals, concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above. Noting that the People's anti-Somoza tribunals have been created specially by an emergency decree in April  the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with political or . common law crimes which the Government considers are unrelated to trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried promptly by independent and impartial judicial body. The Committee also requests the Government to transmit the text of the law instituting the People's anti-Somoza tribunals.(c) With respect to Case No. , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle",-1,1985,Nicaragua
122,"that measures designed to deprive trade union officials and trade unionists of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(d) As regards Case No. , the Committee regrets that, in spite of several requests, the Government has not specifically referred to the allegations of one of the complainants which, on the basis of evidence, accused public officials of having been involved in these incidents and the police of having done nothing to prevent the aggression against the members of the CUS and the destruction of its offices. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that the public authorities are bound, in accordance with Convention No. , to refrain from any interference in the activities and internal workings of trade unions.(e) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments of the trial under way against five trade unionists for having stolen cattle, and asks it to send observations on the trade unions to which it failed to refer and which, according to the ICFTU, were arrested (Eduardo Gutirrez, Juan Gaitn and Enrique Flores). The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the allegation that the children, wives and mothers of the detained trade unionists were threatened with imprisonment if their husbands or children did not give up their CUS membership and that they are constantly visited by police who threaten them and help themselves to toiletries and foodstuffs.(f) Finally, the Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations contained in one of the complainants' communications dated  and  January  (banning of the CUS trade union review; the fact that CUS trade unionists are summoned to appear by the State Security Police Force, and are subjected to pressure and threatened; visits of a delegation of officials to organisations belonging to the CUS in the northern, southern and western areas of the country and warnings to the members that if there were any meetings in the future, those involved would go to prison and that this ban also extended to the setting up of new trade union organisations). The Committee requests the Government to furnish information on these aspects of the case.(g) As regards Case No. , the Committee notes that the Government has sent certain information on only one of the numerous allegations. Since the object of all the allegations in this case is to show a discriminatory attitude by the Government against COSEP, the Committee postpones the examination of the case and requests the Government to provide a reply urgently on those aspects of the case to which it has not referred.(h) As regards Case no. , the Committee regrets that the authorities prohibited the holding of the ""Private Enterprise Day"" on  November , organised by COSEP, and expresses the hope that in future this employers' organisation will be able to determine without any interference the date and activities of the Private Enterprise Day.(i) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the right of occupational organisations to hold meetings in their premises without advance authorisation and without interference by the authorities is a fundamental aspect of freedom of association.(j) The Committee also notes that according to the Government, on  and  September  no one was arrested for matters related directly with the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically whether the president of COSEP was placed under house arrest on  September  (""Private Enterprise Day""), as alleged by the complainant and, if so, the reasons.(k) The Committee observes that Decrees Nos.  and  proclaiming a state of national emergency with the subsequent restrictions on civil and trade union freedoms should have expired at the end of October . The Committee expresses the firm hope that these restrictions will not be re- imposed and requests the Government to furnish information on the subject.",1,1985,Nicaragua
123,".The complaint is set forth in a communication from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) dated  December . The IOE transmitted additional information in a communication dated  December . The Government replied by a communication dated  May .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.The complainant states that the ILO convened in Mexico, from  to  December , an important seminar to which representatives of employers' organisations in Latin America were invited in order to discuss in particular the role of employers' organisations in the creation of jobs. Mr. Enrique Bolaos Geyer, the Chairman of the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise in Nicaragua (COSEP), announced that he would participate.
.According to the complainant, Mr. Bolaos, taking his passport which, as a precaution, he had photocopied and which two Managua notaries had reported intact, presented himself at the passport checking window of Managua airport on  November , i.e.  days before the opening of the seminar. He was forbidden to leave the country because a page was missing from his passport; a page had in fact been torn out of the document.
.The complainant states that, at the request of the other participants who had announced that they would participate in the seminar, the Director-General of the ILO addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on  November , a telegram asking the Minister to intervene in order to facilitate the departure of Mr. Enrique Bolaos Geyer, the Chairman of the COSEP, from Nicaragua so as to enable him to participate in the seminar in question. According to the complainant, this message remained unanswered. Hence Mr. Bolaos Geyer was unable to obtain a new passport, in place of the one which had been mutilated, in time to attend the ILO meeting in Mexico.
.The complainant adds that on  December  the International Organisation of Employers and approximately  participants in the seminar addressed a telegram to the Co-ordinator of the Sandinist Junta regretting with consternation that, despite the message from the Director-General of the ILO, Mr. Bolaos had been forbidden to leave the country in order to attend the seminar, protesting at the violation of freedom of association and of fundamental rights which this entails, and requesting as a matter of urgency that Mr. Bolaos be permitted to participate in the seminar. This telegram too remained unanswered.
.In support of its allegations the IOE transmits a letter it received from Mr. Bolaos in which he stated that, on  November , migration officials removed pages  and  and pages  and  from his passport and then proceeded to cancel the passport. Attached to the letter is a photocopy of all the pages of Mr. Bolaos's passport, taken the day before he presented himself to the migration services and bearing, at the foot of the page, a note to the effect that on  November  all pages of the passport were complete and properly bound.
.Furthermore the complainant adds a statement signed by  persons at variance with the Sandinist regime and calling themselves ""captive dissidents"", in which they report that the Sandinist Government has denied them the right to leave the country freely, and arbitrarily prevented them from doing so although there is no legal impediment to warrant such a course. According to the statement, the improper and illegal procedures used to the detriment of the persons referred to include refusal to issue exist visas on the pretext of non-production of documents not required by law, loss of the passport, the existence of higher orders and inclusion in a special list, and invalidation of the passport either by removing or tearing a page from it or by making laterations in it.
.The statement in question mentions, in addition to the case of Mr. Bolaos and of certain employers' leaders and members of various political parties, the cases of the following persons in particular:NICOLAS BOLA OS GEYER: President of UNCAFENIC, Director of Upanica and delegate to the COSEP. He was refused a visa on the grounds that there was a backlog of work.JUAN RAMON AVILES: Executive Secretary of the COSEP. He was refused a visa at the migration offices on the grounds that his date of birth was wrong. FRANCISCO CALDERA: Executive Secretary of Conapro. He was denied the issue of a passport at the migration offices on the grounds that it had been sent to Special Zone No.  by unintentional error.ORESTES ROMERO ROJAS: Executive Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of Nicaragua. His passport was delivered to him without an exit visa on the grounds that one could not be granted to him.FRANK LEY: Director of the Chamber of Commerce. His passport was not delivered to him; he was made to go repeatedly to the migration office and was not given any reply.CARLOS NOGUERA: Delegate of the Nicaraguan Development Institute (INDE) to the Nicaraguan Democratic Co-ordination Body. His passport was held at the migration office on the grounds that there were restrictions on the issue of visas to certain persons.
.Lastly the IOE reminds the ILO that in  it filed a complaint with the Committee on Freedom of Association alleging that the Government was obstructing the participation of leaders of the COSEP in international meetings (Case No. ) and that the Committee felt bound to recall that ""representatives of workers and employers should enjoy appropriate facilities for carrying out their functions, including the right to leave the country when their activities on behalf of the persons they represent so require"".
.The Government states in its communication of  May  that, according to information from the Migration and Aliens Directorate, section  of the Migration Act, reading as follows, was in fact applied to Mr. Bolaos Geyer: ""No passport or identity and travel document which exhibits alterations or corrections and from which pages or covers are missing shall be valid ..."" In this connection the Government states that the only restrictions in existence in the country on travel abroad are those expressly laid down in the provisions of law. Furthermore the Government states that it has not imposed gratuitous restrictions on any employer. As evidence of the foregoing it may be reported that, according to the migration registers, the same Mr. Bolaos Geyer has made  trips abroad without any obstacle between January  and February  (the Government transmits official certification from the Migration and Aliens Directorate showing  departures from the country by Mr. Bolaos between  and ).
.The Government adds that neither have any gratuitous restrictions been imposed on the self-styled ""captive dissidents"" referred to in the complaint from the complainant organisation. As proof of its assertion, the Government transmits official certification recording the various departures from the country effected in recent years by Mr. Juan Ramn Avils, Mr. Orestes Romero Rojas and eight more ""captive dissidents"".
.The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organisation has alleged the existence of arbitrary restrictions on the right to leave Nicaragua freely. In particular the complainant has referred, firstly, to the case of Mr. Bolaos Geyer, the Chairman of the COSEP, who was unable to attend a seminar organised by the ILO owing to the removal of some pages from his passport and secondly to the case of  persons calling themselves ""captive dissidents"", among whom it refers especially to six leaders of employers' organisations.
.The Committee further observes that the complainant has not indicated the dates on which these six leaders of employers' organisations were prevented from leaving the country, nor whether such restrictions have obstructed or prevented the pursuit of activities by those persons in their capacity as leaders of employers' organisations.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that it has imposed no gratuitous restrictions on any employer for travel abroad and that the only restrictions in existence in Nicaragua in that connection are those expressly laid down in the provisions of law.
.More specifically, with reference to Mr. Bolaos Geyer, the Chairman of the COSEP, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, section  of the Migration Act was applied to this employers' leader - who has left the country  times between  and  - and that this section provides that ""No passport or identity and travel document which exhibits alterations or corrections and from which pages or covers are missing shall be valid ..."" In this connection, the Committee regrets that the Government has confined itself to mentioning section  of the Migration Act, omitting to comment on the complainant organisation's assertion that migration officials removed the sheet bearing pages  and  and that bearing pages  and  from the passport on  November  and then cancelled it. The Committee also observes that the Government has not referred either to the complainant's assertion that on  November , the day before that on which Mr. Bolaos proposed to leave the country, two notaries were able to report",0,1984,Nicaragua
124,"that his passport was intact.
.The Committee strongly deplores the fact that, after the incident affecting Mr. Bolaos had occurred on  November , the authorities did not act on the request made by the Director-General of the ILO on  November  that Mr. Bolaos's departure from the country should be facilitated in order to enable him to participate in the seminar organised by the ILO which was to be held in Mexico from  to  December, that is to say a sufficient number of days after the date on which the incident in question occurred.
.Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the Committee concludes that the Government has not justified the illegal measures, involving the removal of pages from Mr. Bolaos' passport, which prevented him once again from leaving Nicaragua to attend the seminar organised by the ILO in Mexico. In these circumstances, and having regard also to the fact that the Government has not referred specifically to other leaders of employers' organisations having been forbidden to leave the country or obstructed in doing so - although the complainant has not emphasised that these cases were connected with the pursuit of activities in their capacity as leaders of employers' organisations - the Committee is bound to draw the Government's attention as it has done in the past on several occasions, and particularly in  regarding Mr. Bolaos, to the principle that representatives of workers and employers should enjoy appropriate facilities for carrying out their functions, including the right to leave the country when their activities on behalf of the persons they represent so require (see nd Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. ), and that the free movement of these representatives should be ensured by the authorities.
.The Committee also requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the appropriate authorities do not hinder the participation by leaders of workers' or employers' organisations in activities designed to promote and defend the interests of their members.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and in particular the following conclusions:a) The Committee concludes that the Government has not justified the illegal measures, involving the removal of pages from Mr. Bolaos' passport, which once again prevented Mr. Bolaos, the Chairman of the COSEP, from leaving Nicaragua to attend a seminar organised by the ILO in Mexico from  to  December .b) In addition, the Committee strongly deplores the fact that the Nicaraguan authorities did not act on the request made by the Director-General of the ILO on  November  that Mr. Bolaos's departure from the country should be facilitated in order to enable him to participate in the seminar in question.c) The Committee draws the Government's attention as it has done in the past on several occasions, particularly in  regarding Mr. Bolaos, to the principle that representatives of workers and employers should enjoy appropriate facilities for carrying out their functions, including the right to leave the country when their activities on behalf of the persons they represent so require, and that the free movement of these representatives should be ensured by the authorities.d) The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the appropriate authorities do not hinder the participation by leaders of workers' or employers' organisations in activities designed to promote and defend the interests of their members.",0,1984,Nicaragua
125,".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In conformity with the invitation extended by the Government of Nicaragua in a communication dated  May , a study mission visited Nicaragua from  September to  October  (see the mission report annexed hereto).
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua which it has examined on a number of occasions. (See, in particular, the th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).) In addition, three new complaints have been presented by the ICFTU in communications dated  March,  April,  and  May, and  July , by the WCL in a communication of  August (Case No. ) and by the IOE in communications dated  June and  and  July  (Case No. ).
.In a communication of  June , several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua for infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in May , the Committee invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )):(a) The Committee reminds the Government that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights, and requests it to take the necessary measures to ensure that such protection is effectively provided.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the arrest and current situation of the trade unionists Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.(c) The Committee, while noting with interest that the rights suspended by the state of emergency have been restored, requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on the resumption of activities by employers' and workers' organisations in practice, particularly as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, exercise of the right of assembly, registration of these organisations and exercise of the right to strike.(d) Noting that Decree No.  is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of voluntary collective negotiation, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this situation and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt in this connection.(e) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.(f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.The above-mentioned study mission was carried out from  September to  October  by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, accompanied by Mr. Bernard Gernigon, Chief of the ILO Freedom of Association Branch, and Mr. Christian Ramos, an official of said Branch. The report of the representative of the Director-General appears as an annex to this document.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to express its thanks to Mr. Fernando Uribe Restrepo for having undertaken this study mission as the Director-General's representative and for his detailed report on the matters pending.
.Since the complaints and the information gathered during the mission are all analysed in the report of the Director-General's representative, the Committee can proceed directly to its conclusions on the various cases.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes the report of the study mission carried out in Nicaragua and the facilities granted by the authorities to the Director-General's representative for carrying out his mission. It deplores however the fact that the Director-General's representative was not authorised to meet one of the imprisoned persons with whom the mission had asked to speak.b) The Committee requests the Government to furnish a copy of the text of the judgement that will be handed down in the case of CUS trade unionists now held at the ""Zona franca"" penitentiary compound in Managua mentioned in paragraph  above.c) The Committee requests the Government to consider the adoption of amnesty or reduced sentence measures in respect of Mr. Milton Silva Gaitn and Mr. Arcadio Ortz Espinoza, two trade unionists who were sentenced to five and six years' imprisonment.d) The Committee requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.e) The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the arrest of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above (specific facts motivating the arrests, text of the judgements, place of detention).f) As regards the arrests carried out during a hunger strike organised by the Permanent Congress of Workers, the Committee reminds the Government that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is made entails restrictions on freedom of association and that governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities receive appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of arrests being based on trade union activities.g) As regards the attacks carried out against trade union premises and the threats against trade unionists, the Committee recalls that activities of this kind create among trade unionists a climate of fear which is extremely prejudicial to the exercise of trade union activities and that the authorities, when informed of such matters, should carry out an immediate investigation to determine who is responsible and punish the guilty parties.h) As regards the measures taken following the demonstration in Nandaime, the Committee considers, in view of the political nature of this demonstration, that the matter should be examined by other international bodies which have general competence in respect of human rights.i) As regards the confiscation of property, the Committee considers that this measure appears to have been particularly biased against the COSEP leaders and members and it considers that all the provisions relating to compensation for expropriated land should be reviewed to ensure that there is real and fair compensation for the losses sustained by the landowners and that the Government should reopen the compensation files when so requested by persons who consider that they have been despoiled.j) As regards the conviction of Mr. Alegra, the Committee expresses its concern at the procedure followed in this case and at the extreme harshness of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Court of Appeal in Managua will re-examine the case with all the requisite attentiveness and impartiality. It requests the Government to furnish a copy of the decision reached by the Court of Appeal as soon as it is available.k) As regards civil liberties connected with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that unduly severe restrictions still remain and therefore requests the Government to take advantage of the peace process that has begun in Nicaragua to adopt legislation that will fully guarantee the exercise of public freedoms and broaden judicial safeguards.l) As regards tripartite consultations on international labour standards, the Committee requests the Government to set up and convene as soon as possible an advisory committee on this subject - which should be representative of all employers' and workers' organisations - and to furnish information on the",0,1984,Nicaragua
126,"setting up and meetings of this advisory committee.m) On the subject of trade union legislation, the Committee urges the Government to work with all the workers' and employers' organisations - and with the ILO as already accepted by the Government - on the drafting of the new Labour Code which it intends to prepare and it expresses the firm hope that the Government will be able to report very shortly substantial progress towards new legislation in line with Conventions Nos.  and .n) In view of the conclusions it has thus reached, the Committee observes that the situation of employers' and workers' organisations in Nicaragua gives rise to major problems in relation to several basic principles concerning freedom of association and trade union rights. The Committee accordingly considers that the Government should take concrete measures in the shortest possible time to apply fully the Conventions on freedom of association which it has ratified. These measures should cover all the problems which arise in law in relation to both the preparation of a new Labour Code and the adoption of legislation guaranteeing the full exercise of civil liberties. These legal measures should be accompanied by measures relating to factual situations, such as, in the first place, the release of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations at present in detention. Should the Government not supply, before the next meeting of the Committee in February , information demonstrating a change in attitude as regards these matters and a clear desire to make progress as regards the situation of employers' and workers' organisations, as well as their leaders and members, the Committee would consider it necessary to refer the matter to the Governing Body recommending to it the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry in conformity with article , paragraph , of the Constitution.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In conformity with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ), the Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented in virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been examining various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Two cases examined previously and presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) are still before the Committee.
.In addition, in a communication of  June , several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua.
.The cases still pending and the complaint under article  of the Constitution of the ILO were last examined by the Committee at its meeting in February . (See th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th (February-March ) Session.) ).
.Subsequently, the Government supplied its observations in a communication dated  April .
.This complaint, dated  June , was signed by Mr. Henri Georget, Employers' delegate, Niger, Mr. Johan von Holten, Employers' delegate, Sweden, Mr. Hiroshi Tsujino, Employers' delegate, Japan, Mr. Javier Ferrer Dufoll, Employers' delegate, Spain, Mr. Arthur Joao Donato, Employers' delegate, Brazil, Mr. Raoul Inocentes, Employers' delegate, Philippines, Mr. Wolf Dieter Lindner, Employers' delegate, Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Tom D. Owuor, Employers' delegate, Kenya, and Mr. Ray Brillinger, Employers' delegate, Canada. In separate communications, Mr. Roberto Favelevic, Employers' delegate, Argentina, and Mr. Vincente Bortoni, Employers' delegate, Mexico, associated themselves with the complaint.
.In their communication, the complainants recalled that since  at least  complaints had been lodged with the ILO by organisations of workers and employers concerning infringements by the Government of Nicaragua of its obligations under Convention No. . The infringements consisted of murder (Case No. ), physical aggression (Cases Nos. , , ,  and ), torture (Cases Nos.  and ), arbitrary arrests (Cases Nos. , , , , , , , , , , ,  and ), violation of domicile (Cases Nos.  and ), ransacking of offices (Cases Nos.  and ), confiscation of land (Case No. ), restrictions on freedom of movement (Cases Nos. , , ,  and ), violations of freedom of expression (Cases Nos. ,  and ) and a number of other questions involving non-recognition of organisations of self-employed workers until complaints could be presented to the ILO. Any occupational organisation of employers or workers which did not submit to the authority of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) was, according to the complainants, the subject of government repression either through its officials or through organised gangs. Consequently Nicaragua had been in a state of emergency for several years. This state of emergency had been continually extended, most recently by Decree No.  of  January . The complainants added that the state of emergency was used by the Government to suppress all rights and freedoms that were essential for the satisfactory implementation of Convention No.  and to suppress any opposition to the interests of the authorities. Moreover, a new Constitution had been promulgated in January  which implicitly denied employers the right of association, which they had enjoyed previously, while granting this right to many other categories; for the complainants, this was an obvious infringement of Article  and Article , paragraph , of Convention No. .
.The complainants further alleged that Decree No. , issued by the Government on  September  had, since its application, made collective agreements subject to approval by the Ministry of Labour for reasons of economic policy - which, in fact, made freedom to bargain collectively quite meaningless. The complainants considered that, although the competent bodies of the ILO had repeated that this was an infringement of Convention No. , the Government had done nothing to remedy the situation. In particular, wages could not be the subject of collective bargaining since they were determined by the National System of Labour and Wage Organisation (SNOTS) which classified every conceivable form of employment and fixed the corresponding remuneration. The complainants pointed out that this violation of Article  of the Convention was the subject of a recommendation by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complainants stated, moreover, that the most representative organisation of employers in Nicaragua was the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP). This organisation was covered by Article  of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ). Nevertheless, according to the complainants, the Government had not consulted the COSEP on procedures which ensure effective consultations, in accordance with Article  of the instrument. Contrary to what it stated in its report on the application of the Convention, the Government had also neglected to consult the COSEP on matters covered by Article  of the Convention and consequently, the complainants maintained, the Government had respected none of its obligations under the Convention in so far as they related to consultations with the COSEP.
.In conclusion, the complainants requested that this complaint be examined and a report drawn up by a Commission of Inquiry, in accordance with article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the ILO, since, in particular, the Government was ignoring the recommendations of the Governing Body Committee on Freedom of Association and of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, both of which had already expressed their views on the questions referred to above.b. Decision of the Governing Body
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, at the proposal of its Officers, took the following decisions concerning the complaint in question:a) the Government of Nicaragua, as the Government against which the complaint was lodged, should be invited by the Director-General to communicate its observations on the complaint by  January  at the latest;b) at its th Session, the Governing Body would determine in the light of (i) the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning those aspects of the complaint received that concerned freedom of association, (ii) information that might",0,1984,Nicaragua
127,"be furnished by the Government of Nicaragua, and (iii) the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association on cases still outstanding, whether the complaint as a whole should be referred to a Commission of Inquiry.c. The Government's reply.In its reply of  January , the Government stated that, although it was true that several complaints claiming infringement of freedom of association had been presented, it was also true that these matters were closed since the Government had shown that they had nothing to do with trade union affairs but rather involved offences punishable under common law.
.In its reply of  January , the Government stated that, although it was true that several complaints claiming infringement of freedom of association had been presented, it was also true that these matters were closed since the Government had shown that they had nothing to do with trade union affairs but rather involved offences punishable under common law.
.The Government stated that on  January , by Decree No. , it had re-established the state of emergency as a legal means to defend itself against the war waged by the United States against Nicaragua; enforcement of the state of emergency was thus designed to forestall counter-revolutionary activities, thereby preserving the rights of Nicaraguan citizens. According to the Government, the statement that Decree No.  suspended several trade union rights was totally wrong since none of the rights suspended was of a strictly trade union nature. The only suspended right involving labour matters was the right to strike, which was not a trade union right but a right of workers whether or not they belonged to a union.
.The Government added that the establishment of the state of emergency was in line with the provisions of article  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article  of the American Convention of Human Rights.
.According to the Government, the state of emergency had in no way prevented the development of the trade union movement or the freedom of workers to join occupational organisations. Between  and , workers in both towns and the countryside had set up a total of , unions.
.The Government considered it important to recall that the ruling handed down by the International Court of Justice on  June  gave fundamental legal support to the Government and to its right to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity and economic and political independence through the international legal order. According to the Government, it was the policy of aggression against Nicaragua and not the state of emergency which was the cause of the difficult and exceptional circumstances being experienced by Nicaraguan society as a whole. The Government emphasised that it hoped to suspend the state of emergency when the causes which were behind its introduction no longer obtained.
.The Government went on to state that the fact that the right of employers to organise was not embodied in the Constitution should not be understood as a prohibition, since article  of the political Constitution set forth the general principle of the right to organise of all persons in order to defend their interests. Moreover, the employers' right to organise was established in the Labour Code and in the regulations governing occupational associations.
.With respect to Decree No.  of , the Government considered that the provisions in question in no way constituted an infringement of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to negotiate collective agreements and, in accordance with the ILO's principle of tripartism, provision was made for the intervention of the Ministry of Labour. Conditions of employment were negotiated by means of a conciliation procedure. If the latter failed the Ministry of Labour could not impose the terms of a collective agreement on the parties. The matter had to be resolved, during a state of emergency, by an arbitration tribunal which came under the judicial authorities and, in normal times, by the procedure relating to the right to strike.
.According to the Government, the national system for organising labour and wages enabled employers and workers to take part in discussing the bases of the content of work in order to determine wages according to criteria of quantity and complexity.
.Lastly, the Government considered that Convention No.  had not been infringed since consultations had taken place with the organisations which the Government, in its sovereignty, had considered to be the most representative. However, it had no objection to consulting the COSEP as well in due course.
.In its communication of  January  the Government supplied the text of a communiqu stating that as from  January the state of emergency was suspended throughout the territory. The Government also stated in this communiqu that it intended to apply the Amnesty Act No.  when a ceasefire took place and the groups which had taken up arms returned to civilian life. If no such ceasefire took place, the Government would release the persons concerned if the Government of the United States or a central American Government decided to accept them. They would be authorised to return to Nicaragua at the end of the war.
.In a subsequent communication dated  January  the Government supplied the text of Decrees No.  which abolished the anti-Somoza People's courts and No.  which lifted the state of emergency for the whole country and restored the rights and guarantees laid down in the Nicaraguan Constitution.d) Examination of the complaint by the Committee at its meeting in February 
.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalled that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it had adopted conclusions which were approved by the Governing Body and which contained precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases were in a number of instances in contradiction with the allegations made by the authors of the complaints. The Committee was therefore not in a position to draw conclusions from all these cases on the general situation prevailing in Nicaragua with respect to freedom of association.
.As regards the allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No. , the Committee noted that the Committee of Experts had considered whether the wage-fixing system was in conformity with Article  of the Convention.
.Finally, as regards the application of Convention No. , the Committee recalled that it had indicated that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organisations should exist in the legislation and that such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments.
.The Committee noted that the Government had stated that the only labour right suspended by the state of emergency was the right to strike. As regards the employers' right to organise, the Government had pointed out that this right was recognised by the Labour Code and the regulations governing occupational associations and stated that it was willing to consult the COSEP, in due course, on matters concerning international labour standards.
.Furthermore, in a more recent communication the Government announced the suspension of the state of emergency and its willingness, subject to certain conditions, to apply the Amnesty Act. The Committee, while noting this favourable development, observed that there was a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concerned the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and also a number of factual questions.
.Moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations was to examine, at its session in March , the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and  on the basis of the information supplied by the Government at the last session of the Conference to the Committee on the Application of Standards, and of the latest developments that had taken place in the country.
.The Committee considered that the Government's reply for its next session in May, together with the comments of the Committee of Experts, were elements that should be taken into consideration in determining the action to be taken on the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution.
.In the light of these conclusions the Committee requested the Government to supply detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency as regards the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the situation concerning the possible application of the Amnesty Act. The Committee also decided that it would examine at its meeting in May  the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry in response to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, on the basis of the information which would be supplied by the Government and the comments which would be formulated by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations on the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and .e. The Government's subsequent reply
.In its communication dated  April , the Government states",-1,1984,Nicaragua
128,"once again that, by Decree No.  of  January , it lifted the national state of emergency which had been proclaimed in accordance with article  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article  of the American Convention of Human Rights. The Government affirms that lifting the state of emergency was an act of good will on its side, aimed at facilitating the effective implementation of the agreements concluded by the Presidents of Central America on  August  with a view to establishing peace and restoring normal conditions in the region, and in Nicaragua in particular.
.The Government reaffirms that the Decree proclaiming the state of emergency had only temporarily suspended the exercise of one labour-related right: the right to strike recognised in article  of the Constitution. As an Act of the Republic, the suspension Decree applied to the entire population, including employers, workers and their organisations. Thus, suspension of the exercise of certain civil and political liberties could have affected the normal development of activities of these organisations and their members who, as residents in Nicaragua, are obliged to respect the legislation in force.
.The Government states that with the lifting of the national state of emergency the full exercise of the rights and guarantees contained in the political Constitution of Nicaragua has been restored.
.After recalling those provisions of the Constitution which had been suspended and which are now in force again, the Government affirms that restoring these rights has incontestably had a positive effect on all population groups, including workers and employers and their organisations.
.The Government adds that a partial amnesty was declared by the National Assembly on  March , and affected  persons convicted of crimes against public order and security, who are members of the Nicaraguan resistance movement. The Government and the leadership of the Nicaraguan resistance movement are currently discussing a general amnesty, in addition to social issues.
.The workers' organisations' allegations still pending concern the ransacking of trade union premises and the arrest of trade unionists.
.As regards the first point, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, it was because of internal dissension within the Central of Nicaraguan Workers (CTN) and at the request of one of the parties that the police intervened in order to protect persons and property. While noting these explanations, the Committee must recall the importance which it attaches to the protection of trade union property, which was also emphasised by the International Labour Conference in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted in , where it had pointed out that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee would also draw the Government's attention to the fact that, even if police intervention in trade union premises may be justified in particularly serious circumstances, such intervention should in no case entail the ransacking of premises and archives of an organisation.
.As regards the arrest of trade unionists, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, according to which there is no trace of two of these persons ever having been arrested, and that a third was released after having completed the prison term to which he had been sentenced for causing bodily harm. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the situation of two persons concerning whom it has not yet replied, Mr. Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.
.As regards the complaint lodged by several Employers' delegates under article  of the Constitution, the Committee recalls that this complaint contains allegations concerning non-observance of Convention No. , based in particular on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional liberties, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise, non-observance of Convention No. , based on the absence of free collective bargaining, and non-observance of Convention No. , based on the absence of consultations with COSEP by the Government.
.In its reply, the Government refers to the lifting of the national state of emergency. The Committee notes with interest that all of the constitutional rights which had been suspended have thus been restored, in particular in areas relating to the activities of employers' and workers' organisations. The Committee also notes that a partial amnesty has been declared for persons convicted of crimes against public order and security, and that negotiations are under way with a view to declaring a general amnesty.
.The Committee observes, however, that the Government has confined itself to supplying general information on the restoration of the rights which had been suspended, without supplying specific information on the resumption of the activities of employers' and workers' organisations in practice. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on this point, in particular as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, the exercise of employers' and workers' organisations' right to assemble, the registration of such organisations and the exercise of the right to strike.
.As regards the allegations relating to the application of Convention No. , the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts emphasised in its report, adopted at its March  Session, that Decree No.  referred to in the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, has been in force for more than seven years and that it makes collective agreements subject to the approval of the Ministry of Labour for reasons of economic policy, so that employers' and workers' organisations are not able to fix wages freely. Like the Committee of Experts, the Committee considers that this situation is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of machinery for voluntary collective negotiation. It therefore requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this infringement of the Convention and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt for this purpose.
.As regards the application of Convention No. , the Government does not supply any new information on consultation of COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards, although it stated in its reply submitted to the Committee's February  meeting that it was willing to consult it in due course. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or which it intends to undertake with COSEP.
.In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Committee must note that the Government has not supplied all the necessary information to enable it to reach a decision in full knowledge of all the facts concerning the situation of employers' and workers' organisations in Nicaragua.
.In the light of the information before it, the Committee examined what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO. First, the Committee considered the possibility of adjourning the adoption of its recommendation to the Governing Body until its meeting in November . Secondly, the Committee examined the possibility of recommending to the Governing Body at its present session the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry. Thirdly, the Committee considered the possibility of recommending the Governing Body to ask the Government to invite a study mission entrusted to examine on the spot the factual and legal questions pending before the Committee since . Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question put at the beginning of this paragraph.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee reminds the Government that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights, and requests it to take the necessary measures to ensure that such protection is effectively provided.b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the arrest and current situation of the trade unionists Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.c) The Committee, while noting with interest that the rights suspended by the state of emergency have been restored, requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on the resumption of activities by employers' and workers' organisations in practice, particularly as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, exercise of the right of assembly, registration of these organisations and exercise of the right to strike.d) Noting that Decree No.  is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of voluntary collective negotiation, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this situation and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt in this connection.e) The Committee",-1,1984,Nicaragua
129,"requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos.  and ) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. ,  and ) by the International Organisation of Employers.
.Cases Nos.  and  were last examined by the Committee at its November  meeting and Cases Nos.  and  in February . (See respectively th Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (November  and February-March ).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. .
.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated  May  (for Case No. ),  August  (for Cases Nos. , ,  and ),  January  (for Cases Nos.  and ) and  February  (for Cases Nos. ,  and ).
.In addition, in a communication of  June , several employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of ,  and  January .
.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.
.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.
.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.
.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.
.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. .) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.
.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.
.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September , the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.
.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these measures corresponded to the needs of agrarian reform. While realising that the persons mentioned in the IOE's complaint cannot take advantage of their position as COSEP leaders to evade the consequences of an agrarian reform policy, the Committee must nevertheless point out with concern that these measures have allegedly affected a large number of leaders of the employers' organisation in a discriminatory fashion. It expresses the hope that the persons in question will be fairly compensated for their losses as provided for by law.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that there is no trace of any expulsion order against Mr. Frank Bendaa, the Vice-President of COSEP. Given the contradiction between the complainants' version of the facts and that of the Government, the Committee can only recall generally, that the expulsion of leaders of employers' or workers' organisations from their country for having been involved in activities linked to their position, is not only contrary to human rights, but also interferes in the activities of the organisations to which they belong (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada) para. ).
.The Government has not made a specific reply to the requests for information concerning the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day. It confines itself to stating that no citizen was deprived of his liberty on that occasion. The Committee notes this information but regrets that the authorities banned the celebrating of this Private Enterprise Day.
.The Committee notes that the newspaper La Prensa is once again circulating freely and expresses the hope that this measure will be final. It would, indeed, recall that the right of an employers' or workers' organisation to express its opinions uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. ).
.Lastly, as concerns the suspension of the state of emergency, the Committee refers to the considerations set out hereafter concerning the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Governing Body must consider, in the present case, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry under article  of the Constitution. This complaint contains allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No.  based mainly on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional freedoms, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the absence of free collective bargaining; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the Government's failure to consult the COSEP.
.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it has adopted conclusions which were approved by the Governing Body, and which contain precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases are in a number",0,1984,Nicaragua
130,"of instances in contradiction with the allegations made by the authors of the complaints. The Committee is therefore not in a position at the moment to draw conclusions from the basis of all these cases on the general situation prevailing in Nicaragua in the freedom of association field.
.As regards the allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No. , the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts has considered whether the wage fixing system is in conformity with Article  of the Convention.
.Finally, as regards the application of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that it has indicated that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organisations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments.
.The Committee notes that the Government has stated that the only labour right suspended by the state of emergency is the right to strike. As regards the employers' right to organise, the Government points out that this right is recognised by the Labour Code and the regulations governing occupational associations and states that it is willing to consult the COSEP, in due course, on matters concerning international labour standards.
.Furthermore, in a more recent communication, the Government announces the suspension of the state of emergency and its willingness, subject to certain conditions, to apply the Amnesty Act. The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency for the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the possible application of the Amnesty Act. The Committee, while noting this favourable development, observes, however, that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.
.Moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations is to examine, at its next session in March , the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and  on the basis of the information supplied by the Government at the last session of the Conference to the Committee on the Application of Standards, and of the latest developments that have taken place in the country.
.The Committee considers that the Government's reply for its next session in May, together with the comments of the Committee of Experts, are elements that should be taken into consideration in determining the action to be taken on the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution. The Committee therefore decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May , on the basis of this information, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists, to which it has still not replied.b) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that instructions are given so that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and that provision is made for effective punishment where there is evidence of such treatment.c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that searches of trade union premises are carried out only on orders from an ordinary court. It requests the Government to indicate whether a warrant was in fact issued for the search of the CTN premises.d) The Committee, while noting that the expropriation of land and assets belonging to the leaders of the COSEP is, according to the Government, part of an agrarian reform, notes with concern that these measures have allegedly affected in a discriminatory way a large number of COSEP leaders. It expresses the hope that the persons concerned will be fairly compensated for their losses in accordance with the law.e) The Committee once again deplores the fact that the authorities banned celebration of Private Enterprise Day, organised by the COSEP.f) The Committee notes that the trade union review of the CUS and the newspaper La Prensa can again be published and circulated and expresses the hope that these measures will be final. It would indeed draw the Government's attention to the principle that the right to express opinions through the press without previous authorisation is one of the essential elements of the rights of workers' and employers' organisations.g) The Committee notes that the Government has announced the lifting of the state of emergency. It requests the Government to supply detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency as regards the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the situation concerning the possible application of the Amnesty Act. However, the Committee observes that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.h) The Committee decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May  the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry in response to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, on the basis of the information which will be supplied by the Government and the comments which will be formulated by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and . Geneva,  February . Roberto Ago, Chairman.
.The Committee last examined cases ,  and  at its November  meeting (see st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )).
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  (presented by the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour) at its November  and February  meetings. (See th Report, paras.  to , and rd Report, paras.  to  and , approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions in November  and February-March , respectively.) The World Confederation of Labour sent new allegations in a communication dated  November .
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labour) has already been examined by the Committee on four occasions: March , March and June  and March . (See nd, rd, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body.)
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) was examined in February-March  and was the subject of an interim report approved by the Governing Body. (th Report, paras.  to .) At a later date, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  and  January and  and  March .
.The complaints concerning Cases Nos.  and  appear in communications from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) of  July (Case No. ) and  October  (Case No. ). With regard to the first case, the E sent additional information in a communication dated  August .
.The Government replied in communications dated  and  November ,  January,  February,  and  May and  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) In the first place, the Committee expresses its concern at the gravity of the allegations made by employers' and workers' organisations concerning, in particular, the detention and sentencing of trade unionists and the interference by the authorities in the activities of the occupational organisations.(b) As regards Case No.  the Committee urges the Government to transmit information on certain aspects of the case, as well as the judgements handed down or which will be handed down by the People's anti-Somoza tribunals, concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above. Noting that the People's anti-Somoza tribunals have been created specially by an emergency decree in April  the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with political or . common law crimes which the Government considers are unrelated to trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried promptly by independent and impartial judicial body. The Committee also requests the Government to transmit the text of the law instituting the People's anti-Somoza tribunals.(c) With respect to Case No. , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union officials and trade unionists of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union",-1,1984,Nicaragua
131,"grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(d) As regards Case No. , the Committee regrets that, in spite of several requests, the Government has not specifically referred to the allegations of one of the complainants which, on the basis of evidence, accused public officials of having been involved in these incidents and the police of having done nothing to prevent the aggression against the members of the CUS and the destruction of its offices. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that the public authorities are bound, in accordance with Convention No. , to refrain from any interference in the activities and internal workings of trade unions.(e) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments of the trial under way against five trade unionists for having stolen cattle, and asks it to send observations on the trade unions to which it failed to refer and which, according to the ICFTU, were arrested (Eduardo Gutirrez, Juan Gaitn and Enrique Flores). The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the allegation that the children, wives and mothers of the detained trade unionists were threatened with imprisonment if their husbands or children did not give up their CUS membership and that they are constantly visited by police who threaten them and help themselves to toiletries and foodstuffs.(f) Finally, the Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations contained in one of the complainants' communications dated  and  January  (banning of the CUS trade union review; the fact that CUS trade unionists are summoned to appear by the State Security Police Force, and are subjected to pressure and threatened; visits of a delegation of officials to organisations belonging to the CUS in the northern, southern and western areas of the country and warnings to the members that if there were any meetings in the future, those involved would go to prison and that this ban also extended to the setting up of new trade union organisations). The Committee requests the Government to furnish information on these aspects of the case.(g) As regards Case No. , the Committee notes that the Government has sent certain information on only one of the numerous allegations. Since the object of all the allegations in this case is to show a discriminatory attitude by the Government against COSEP, the Committee postpones the examination of the case and requests the Government to provide a reply urgently on those aspects of the case to which it has not referred.(h) As regards Case no. , the Committee regrets that the authorities prohibited the holding of the ""Private Enterprise Day"" on  November , organised by COSEP, and expresses the hope that in future this employers' organisation will be able to determine without any interference the date and activities of the Private Enterprise Day.(i) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the right of occupational organisations to hold meetings in their premises without advance authorisation and without interference by the authorities is a fundamental aspect of freedom of association.(j) The Committee also notes that according to the Government, on  and  September  no one was arrested for matters related directly with the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically whether the president of COSEP was placed under house arrest on  September  (""Private Enterprise Day""), as alleged by the complainant and, if so, the reasons.(k) The Committee observes that Decrees Nos.  and  proclaiming a state of national emergency with the subsequent restrictions on civil and trade union freedoms should have expired at the end of October . The Committee expresses the firm hope that these restrictions will not be re- imposed and requests the Government to furnish information on the subject.
.The Committee examined Case No.  on two occasions, at its November l and February l meetings, when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body. (See lth Report, paras. -, and rd Report, paras. - and , approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions in November l and February-March l respectively.) The World Confederation of Labour sent additional information in support of its complaint on  April l.
.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee on four occasions: in March l, March and June l and March l. (See nd, rd, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body.)
.Case No.  was examined in the Committee's rd Report (see paras. - and ) approved by the Governing Body at its February-March l session. The Committee also noted certain information communicated by the Government in January l (See th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in February-March l).
.Case No.  was examined in February-March l and was the subject of an interim report approved by the Governing Body. (th Report, paras. -.)
.The Government supplied certain information on these cases in communications of January, May and  October l.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, l (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, l (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions: Generally speaking, the Committee observes that, during its session in May l, the Government supplied detailed replies on certain aspects of the present cases, but regrets that it has not replied to all the allegations. The Committee also deplores that the latest information supplied by the Government concerning the detention of trade unionists was only received by the Committee during its present meeting.a) In Case No.  the Committee notes that Mr. Mora has been pardoned and that Mr. Snchez has been sentenced for activities unconnected with freedom of association.b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied regarding the imprisonment of three trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, the names of which are annexed to the present report, and on the refusal to register the executive committees of the agricultural unions of Ftima and Las Mojarras in El Jicaral (department of Len) and of La Concepcin in Matagalpa, and of the unions of service station workers in Chinandega and Managua.c) In Case No.  the Committee notes that of the  trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, six have been released and three have received prison sentences. It requests the Government to supply copies of the judgements handed down against these three persons and to indicate whether the nine other trade unionists cited in the Annex are still in prison and, if so, to state the reasons for their detention.d) In Case No.  the Committee considers that, bearing in mind the allegations that trade union officials have been subjected to reprisals and violence for having belonged to a union affiliated to the CTN, it must recall the importance which it attaches to the exercise of trade union activities in full freedom. It therefore urges the Government to make efforts to guarantee a climate favourable to the peaceful development of the different tendencies of the trade union movement in Nicaragua.e) In Case No.  the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not replied to the allegations still pending.f) The Committee repeats its earlier request for an explanation of the occupation of the CUS headquarters on  August , led by two persons alleged to have links with the State Security forces, as evidenced by the statement made by the former legal adviser to the CUS.g) The Committee again requests the Government to reply to the allegation that, during the second occupation of the CUS headquarters on  August l, the police did nothing to stop the attack and intervened only when everything was over, although they were in the vicinity of the organisation's headquarters.h) The Committee again requests the Government to indicate whether Jos Agustn Tllez, Secretary-General of the Federation of Peasant Workers in Carazo, is in prison and if so, to indicate the grounds for his detention.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), dated  August . The ICFTU later sent additional information in communications dated  September,  October and  November . The Government replied in communications dated  September  and January .
.At the same time the complaint was submitted, several international trade union organisations requested the Director-General of the ILO to intercede with the Government in connection with the issues raised in the complaint. The Director-General immediately intervened in response to this request.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In its communication of  August , the ICFTU alleges that on  August , the Sandinista police, acting upon instructions from the Minister of the Interior, violently broke into and occupied the",1,1984,Nicaragua
132,"headquarters of the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS), during a meeting of the CUS Executive. According to the ICFTU, this occupation resulted in the injury of eight persons and the arrest of a trade unionist, Sara Mndez (Department of Lon) and of her son.
.The ICFTU points out that, on  August , the CUS headquarters had been broken into late at night by a group of persons travelling in a state-owned vehicle and that they had caused damage to the building and to files. This event occurred when the leading officials of the CUS were attending the ICFTU conference on new approaches to the economic crisis in Central America and the Caribbean, held in Cuernavaca (Mexico).
.In its communication of  September , the ICFTU sent the following additional information:
.In its communication of  October , the ICFTU sent a list containing the names of  persons who were injured and beaten on  August  by persons belonging to the ""turbas divinas"" (divine hordes).The ICFTU also encloses a statement from Favio Antonio Lpez Ruiz, sworn before a notary, in which he states that he was subjected to pressure by the authorities, contrary to the interests of the CUS, particularly with respect to the events covered in the present complaint. According to Lpez Ruiz, in May , officials from the Ministry of the Interior forced him to pledge in writing that he would be instrumental in breaking up or doing away with independent organisations like the CUS; if he betrayed the orders received, he would pay with his death. Later, on  August , an official from the Ministry of the Interior Ernesto Zeledn (Martn) proposed that he should seek out persons belonging to the CUS to support those who had stormed the headquarters of this organisation and who did not belong to the CUS. Later, when Ernesto Zeledn learnt that Lpez Ruiz did not agree with the mission entrusted to him, he forced him to go to Managua; he paid his return fare and Lpez Ruiz arrived in the city on  August. At the CUS headquarters, members and non-members of the CUS were present; several CUS members had been forced or tricked into attending by Germn Reyes and Victoria Garca de Castillo. A meeting was being held on that day and, when the parties present failed to reach an agreement, several persons began to attack the true members of the CUS, inflicting injuries on the members and partially destroying the CUS headquarters.
.Finally, in its communication of  November , the ICFTU alleges that on  October , Jos Agustn Tllez, Secretary-General of the Federation of Peasant Workers in Carazo (FETRACAMCA), was arbitrarily arrested. According to the ICFTU, this arrest is part of the campaign carried out by persons belonging to the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to destroy or divide the CUS and its member organisations.
.The Government states that the headquarters of the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) were occupied by members of the CUS itself (including leading officials) as a protest against certain policies followed by some of the leaders. According to the Government, this was a problem within the CUS itself, caused by divided opinions amongst its members as to whether the CUS should remain within or withdraw from the political opposition grouping known as the Democratic Co-ordinating Body ""Ramiro Sacasa"".Later, there were various disputes, still amongst the CUS members themselves, which led to disorderly brawls. These differences of opinions finally resulted in the violent occurrences of  August . The violence reached such a pitch that those involved brandished steel blades and blunt instruments. A woman brandishing a knife, as well as her son who was carrying a cudgel, were arrested by the police whilst they were attacking several members of the CUS. They were released several hours later. Before these events occurred, the residents in the town, the organisation's rank and file and some of the leading officials had requested the Sandinista police to take over the organisation's equipment for safe keeping, whilst a solution was found to the dispute which had arisen amongst its leaders, as a group of CUS members were threatening to damage the equipment. Once the problem had been resolved, on  September , at . p.m., the second in command of Unit IV of the Sandinista police formally handed over the CUS headquarters to Germn Reyes Monjarrez (disputes secretary) and Victoria Garca de Castillo (secretary of the national women's movement); the latter signed a document in which they stated that they had taken possession of the said organisation's assets in the state in which they had been handed over to the police and that they were entirely satisfied. Later, both these officials were expelled from the organisation, as they both held opinions which clashed with those of the Secretary-General and the political secretary of the CUS. The Government states that it does not consider that it has infringed Convention No.  in any way and that the police were only doing their duty.
.In the press cuttings sent by the Government, it is mentioned that, on  September , the CUS headquarters was handed over to Germn Reyes and Victoria Garca. Other members of the CUS Executive who had taken part in the negotiations for the return of the premises were not present when they were handed back, apparently because they were involuntarily delayed.
.The Committee notes that in the present complaint, the complainant alleges that the CUS headquarters were occupied on two occasions. They were first occupied by a group of about  persons on  August . On the second occasion, they were occupied by the police on  August  after groups had first broken in; upon entering, the police arrested a trade unionist (Sara Mndez) and her -year old son. The complainant alleged that when certain groups violently broke into the headquarters,  persons were injured and there was considerable material damage; it also alleges that both during the first period of occupation and the second period of occupation by the police, the premises suffered material damage and documents were destroyed. The Government replied that, on the first occasion, the premises were occupied by members of the CUS, including members of the Executive, as a protest against certain policies carried out by some of the leaders; it added that, at a later date, there were various disputes amongst CUS members which resulted in disorderly brawls; indeed, before this situation arose, the organisation's rank and file and some members of the Executive had requested the police to take over the CUS assets for safekeeping. The two persons arrested for attacking CUS members with steel blades and blunt instruments were only detained for a few hours. The CUS assets were handed over by the police on  September  to two members of the Executive.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers the alleged occurrences to be a reflection of the problems inside the CUS itself; indeed, there are conflicting opinions within the organisation as to whether it should remain in or withdraw from the political opposition grouping ""Coordinadora Democrtica Ramiro Sacasa"". However, the complainant's version of the facts stresses that they were the outcome of interference by public officials, aimed at bringing about the CUS's withdrawal from the Democratic Co-ordinating Body. The complainant backs up this version by stating that the first group of persons to occupy the CUS were travelling in a state-owned van; furthermore, it was headed by two persons connected with the government state security services, Germn Reyes and Victoria Garca (though it acknowledges that they were leading officials of the CUS). As further evidence, the complainant also submitted a statement from a former legal adviser to the CUS, sworn before a notary, in which he attests that he was subjected to threats and pressures to carry out actions aimed at eliminating the CUS. In particular, the former legal adviser maintains in the statement: () that an official from the Ministry of the Interior proposed that he seek out persons belonging to the CUS to support those who had taken over the headquarters of this organisation, and who did not belong to the CUS; () that he was obliged to go to the CUS headquarters on  August  (evidently with a view to supporting those occupying the premises), where he encountered members and non-members of the CUS; () that there was a meeting on the same day and, as the parties present failed to reach an agreement, several persons began to attack the true members of the CUS; as a result, injuries were inflicted on the members and the offices of the CUS headquarters were partially destroyed.
.With respect to the allegation that trade unionists had been beaten and injured on  August  at the CUS headquarters, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the police had done nothing to avoid the attack by certain groups, in spite of the fact that they were in the vicinity of the CUS headquarters, intervening only",0,1984,Nicaragua
133,"when everything was over.
.In order to be able to make a pronouncement on the allegations in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send it its specific observations on the complainant's allegations that the CUS had been occupied on successive occasions as a result of interference by public officials and to reply to the allegation that the police, in spite of being in the vicinity of the CUS headquarters on  August , did nothing to avoid the attack by certain groups, intervening only when everything was over. However, the Committee would point out that the climate of violence which forms the background to some of the allegations can only impede the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Finally, the Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegation concerning the arrest of Jos Agustn Tllez, Secretary-General of FETRACAMCA.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:a) With respect to the occupation of the CUS headquarters on two occasions, and in order to be able to pronounce on this matter in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send specific observations on the complainant's allegations that the occupation of the CUS premises on successive occasions resulted from interference by public officials (in particular, on the link between the State security forces and the two persons who carried out the first occupation, and the notarised statements of the former legal adviser to the CUS concerning interference by the authorities in the two occupations of the CUS headquarters).b) The Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegation that the police, in spite of being in the vicinity of the CUS headquarters on  August  (the day on which the violent events mentioned in the complaint occurred), did nothing to avoid the attack by certain groups, intervening only when everything was over.c) The Committee would point out that the climate of violence which forms the background to some of the allegations can only impede the free exercise of trade union rights.d) The Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegation concerning the arrest of Jos Agustn Tllez, Secretary-General of FETRACAMCA.",1,1984,Nicaragua
134,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour of  May . This organisation submitted additional information in a communication dated  June . The Government replied in a communication of  July .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant alleges that on  April , the state security authorities arrested Luis Manuel Mora Snchez, President of the Union of Press Workers of Managua (affiliated to the Central of Nicaraguan Workers (CTN)), and correspondent for Radio Impacto, of which the headquarters is in San Jos de Costa Rica. The complainant alleges that Mr. Mora is in solitary confinement, that his defence counsels have unsuccessfully applied for amparo (a writ to constitutional rights) and a writ of habeas corpus and that he is allegedly injured as a result of torture.
.According to the complainant, Mr. Mora was arrested for a broadcast on Radio Impacto in which he interviewed a group of mothers whose sons had been obliged to do military service; these mothers had not heard how or where their sons were for several weeks.
.The complainant also points out that Mr. Mora was forced, from his prison cell, to make a confession on television on  May,  (for belonging to a guerilla organisation and colluding with diplomats from the United States in the course of his work as a journalist, etc.), and is afraid that this might be used as incriminating evidence in the trial which is taking place against him at the People's Anti-Somozan Courts. The complainant states that two editorials in the newspaper ""La Prensa"", which denounced this false confession as being devoid of truth and the result of considerable' pressure, were censored.
.Finally, the complainant alleges that Jorge Ortega Rayo,' member of the Union of Press Workers, has been arrested and arbitrarily accused of counter-revolutionary activities and banished to the free trade zone; it also alleges the arrest, on  June , of two CTN officials, Antonio Benito Gmez Centeno and Numan Pompilio Caldern Araus. With respect to these two union officials, the complainant points out that their whereabouts are unknown, that the authorities deny their arrest and that applications for habeas corpus. presented by their lawyers have been unsuccessful.
.The Government states that Mora Snchez's arrest was not arbitrary and that he was not taken into custody for having interviewed a group of mothers whose sons were engaged in patriotic military service. Mr. Mora was arrested for activities against the order and public security of the Nicaraguan State. According to his own statements, his criminal actions had been as follows: he belonged to the counter-revolutionary group known as ""Democratic Revolutionary' Alliance (ARDE)"", which mounted armed attacks against Nicaragua from Costa Rican territory in order, to create a ""Western Front"" and, in so doing, he recruited a number of individuals with whom he planned a series of crimes, some of which he carried out. For instance, he attempted to burn down the bull ring in Managua, incited a group of workers to confront the Sandinista police on  May and scribbled signs (posters) with counter-revolutionary messages on highways; he also traveled several times abroad to meet with counter-revolutionary leaders in order to co-ordinate activities, pass on information on security and be paid dollars for his recruitment work and operating expenses.
.The Government concludes by pointing out that Mr. Mora is at present being tried by the competent courts in the city of Managua.
.With respect to the trade union leader Luis Manuel Mora Snchez, the Committee notes that the versions given by the complainant and the Government concerning the grounds for his arrest and trial are contradictory. Indeed, according to the complainant, Mr. Mora was arrested for having broadcast on Radio Impacto an interview with a group of mothers whose sons had been obliged to do military service and concerning whose health or whereabouts they had had no news. The Government, on the other hand, denied that this had been the reason for the arrest and claimed that it was the result of criminal actions, such as belonging to a counter-revolutionary group which carried out armed attacks from Costa Rica, attempting to burn down the bull ring in Managua, inciting a group of workers to confront the Sandinista police on  May and writing signs with counter-revolutionary messages on highways, etc.
.The Committee concludes that the grounds for the arrest and trial of Mr. Mora, raised by the complainant and denied by the Government, are not connected with freedom of association but with the freedom of expression of journalists in the course of their duties. However, the Committee notes that although some of the grounds for Mr. Mora's arrest and trial listed by the Government are crimes in common law, others might be connected with the exercise of trade union rights; in particular, the action to incite a group of workers to confront the Sandinista police on  May and the posting of signs with ""counter-revolutionary"" messages on highways. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judgment pronounced concerning Mr. Mora.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the arrest of the trade unionist Jorge Ortega Rayo and the trade union officials Antonio Benito Gmez Centeno and Numan Pompilio Caldern Araus. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In view of the fact that some of the grounds for the arrest and trial of the trade union leader Luis Manuel Mora Snchez, listed by the Government, might be connected with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judgment pronounced concerning Mr. Mora.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest of the trade unionist Jorge Ortega Rayo and the trade union officials Antonio Benito Gmez Centeno and Numan Pompilio Caldern Araus.",0,1984,Nicaragua
135,".In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following recommendations:
.General recommendations(a) The Committee appreciates the spirit of co-operation that the Government has demonstrated by accepting that the Director-General's representative, during the direct contacts mission, could examine with the authorities the various aspects of the cases which were still pending and seek further information on them. The Committee observes that, thanks to the information obtained by the Director-General's representative, it has been able to examine a substantial number of the allegations to which the Government had not replied. However, the Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied detailed information on certain outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the statement made by the Deputy Minister concerning the content of the complaints the Committee recalls that even if, in certain instances, the allegations have lacked some precision, it is required to examine them in all objectivity and to seek to obtain a maximum of information concerning them.(c) The Committee wishes to express its serious concern at the large number of leaders and members of workers' and employers' organisations who have been arrested. The Committee considers that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights and in particular, the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, are fully respected and guaranteed.(d) The Committee observes from its examination of certain allegations and of the information supplied by the Government and from the mission report that acts of hostility between union organisations or within individual organisations occur rather frequently. The Committee considers that freedom of association implies the right of workers' and employers' organisations to resolve any difficulties by themselves, and without interference by the authorities; the Committee also considers that it is for the Government to create an atmosphere conducive to the resolution of such difficulties.
.Recommendations as to individual casesCase No. (a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied the text of the judgment handed down by the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of employer leader Salazar Argello which was handed down some time ago; it urges the Government to transmit this judgment at an early date.(b) The Committee notes with interest that the public prosecutor aid not bring any penal charges against certain employer leaders for offences against the security of the State and other offences. The Committee would recall that the preventive detention of leaders of workers' or employers' organisations for activities connected with the exercise of their rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) As regards the composition of the Council of State, the Committee considers that participation of workers' and employers' organisations in the Council should imply the strict application of criteria on the basis of which the representativity of these organisations may be determined; moreover, the participation of these organisations in the Council should not deprive other organisations of their right to defend the interests of their members.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take up the suggestion of the Director-General's representative that the Ministry responsible for agrarian reform should obtain further information and be informed of the allegations that members of the CTN have been physically attacked by the authorities on state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations and that sugar workers affiliated to the CTN have been prevented from entering their work centres; the Committee also requests the complainant to transmit any further information it may have concerning this matter.(b) The Committee requests the Government to call for an investigation of the alleged threats by official militias against the lives of trade union leaders (specifically, Luis Mora and Salvador Snchez) and to keep it informed of its findings.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has been recommending trade union organisations to join the Sandinista Central of Workers (CST) and that copies of the by-laws of trade union organisations, on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead, have been deposited at the headquarters of the CST so that it can register the recently constituted organisations among its members.(b) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that SEEOMC leader Alejandro Arnuero, who was to take part in a congress of the International Transport Workers' Federation in Brazil, had his passport withdrawn without any valid reason. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the final decision handed down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgment handed down on the granting of legal personality to the trade union of workers in various undertakings in the sugar sector (""Faustino Martinez"" and others) so that it can reach conclusions on the allegations with all relevant information at its disposal.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the searching of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the use of aggression against its leaders.(f) The Committee regrets that the Government has not indicated the precise grounds for the arrest of a number of trade unionists who have now been released but merely gives the name o the Act that they are said to have contravened; it again requests the Government to transmit information on this matter.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the information passed on by the CTN to the Director-General's representative concerning seven trade unionists who, contrary to the claims of the Government, are allegedly still in custody.The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations concerning arrests to which it has not replied, involving  union leaders or members.(h) In general terms, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures designed to deprive persons of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(i) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations that rural workers of WASACA affiliated to the CTN have been interrogated and threatened with imprisonment and that Eugenio Membreo and other members of the CTN executive committee have been threatened and intimidated in their homes. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(j) The Committee considers that no further examination need be made of the allegations relating to the coercion of Denis Maltes; the persecution and harassment of Zacaras Hernndez and Isabel Somarriba; the interference in the SEEOMC meeting on  December ; the detention of  trade union leaders and members of SEEOMC; and the physical attacks and threats against leaders of the CUS due to the SEEOMC meeting called for  May .Case No. (a) The Committee notes with interest that the General Labour Inspectorate has ordered the reinstatement of eight trade unionists employed by ENABUS who, according to the complainants, were dismissed for being members of an organisation affiliated to the CTN.(b) The Committee requests the complainants to send further details regarding the alleged destruction of the premises of the rural workers' union in Rio Grande and Las Mojarras (Department of Len) and to indicate exactly in which locality the five leaders of the Union of Workers of the Hacienda El Progreso were dismissed on  January  and prevented from returning to work despite a court order to reinstate them (according to the Government, there are over a hundred plantations under the name of ""El Progreso"").(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied, involving the union leader Hermgenes Aguirre Largaespada and trade unionist Larry Lee Shoures and the arrest of trade unionist Abelino Gonzlez, Piz.Case No. (a) Since there is no record of any charges having been brought against the persons concerned, the Committee regrets that four union leaders should have been held in custody for a long time and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the preventive detention of union leaders entails a serious risk of interference in the activities of trade union organisations.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Salomn Daz Fernndez is being held for counter-revolutionary activities and requests the Government to indicate whether he is still in custody and to specify the precise charges brought against him.",1,1983,Nicaragua

It requests the Government to supply copies of the judgements handed down against these three persons and to indicate whether the nine other trade unionists cited in the Annex are still in prison and, if so, to state the reasons for their detention.d) In Case No.  the Committee considers that, bearing in mind the allegations that trade union officials have been subjected to reprisals and violence for having belonged to a union affiliated to the CTN, it must recall the importance which it attaches to the exercise of trade union activities in full freedom.

(See th Report, paras.  to , and rd Report, paras.  to  and , approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions in November  and February-March , respectively.) The World Confederation of Labour sent new allegations in a communication dated  November .
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labour) has already been examined by the Committee on four occasions: March , March and June  and March . (See nd, rd, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body.)
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) was examined in February-March  and was the subject of an interim report approved by the Governing Body. (th Report, paras.  to .) At a later date, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  and  January and  and  March .
.The complaints concerning Cases Nos.  and  appear in communications from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) of  July (Case No. ) and  October  (Case No. ). With regard to the first case, the E sent additional information in a communication dated  August .
.The Government replied in communications dated  and  November ,  January,  February,  and  May and  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) In the first place, the Committee expresses its concern at the gravity of the allegations made by employers' and workers' organisations concerning, in particular, the detention and sentencing of trade unionists and the interference by the authorities in the activities of the occupational organisations.(b) As regards Case No.  the Committee urges the Government to transmit information on certain aspects of the case, as well as the judgements handed down or which will be handed down by the People's anti-Somoza tribunals, concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above. Noting that the People's anti-Somoza tribunals have been created specially by an emergency decree in April  the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with political or . common law crimes which the Government considers are unrelated to trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried promptly by independent and impartial judicial body. The Committee also requests the Government to transmit the text of the law instituting the People's anti-Somoza tribunals.(c) With respect to Case No. , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union officials and trade unionists of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(d) As regards Case No. , the Committee regrets that, in spite of several requests, the Government has not specifically referred to the allegations of one of the complainants which, on the basis of evidence, accused public officials of having been involved in these incidents and the police of having done nothing to prevent the aggression against the members of the CUS and the destruction of its offices. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that the public authorities are bound, in accordance with Convention No. , to refrain from any interference in the activities and internal workings of trade unions.(e) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments of the trial under way against five trade unionists for having stolen cattle, and asks it to send observations on the trade unions to which it failed to refer and which, according to the ICFTU, were arrested (Eduardo Gutirrez, Juan Gaitn and Enrique Flores). The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the allegation that the children, wives and mothers of the detained trade unionists were threatened with imprisonment if their husbands or children did not give up their CUS membership and that they are constantly visited by police who threaten them and help themselves to toiletries and foodstuffs.(f) Finally, the Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations contained in one of the complainants' communications dated  and  January  (banning of the CUS trade union review; the fact that CUS trade unionists are summoned to appear by the State Security Police Force, and are subjected to pressure and threatened; visits of a delegation of officials to organisations belonging to the CUS in the northern, southern and western areas of the country and warnings to the members that if there were any meetings in the future, those involved would go to prison and that this ban also extended to the setting up of new trade union organisations). The Committee requests the Government to furnish information on these aspects of the case.(g) As regards Case No. , the Committee notes that the Government has sent certain information on only one of the numerous allegations. Since the object of all the allegations in this case is to show a discriminatory attitude by the Government against COSEP, the Committee postpones the examination of the case and requests the Government to provide a reply urgently on those aspects of the case to which it has not referred.(h) As regards Case no. , the Committee regrets that the authorities prohibited the holding of the ""Private Enterprise Day"" on  November , organised by COSEP, and expresses the hope that in future this employers' organisation will be able to determine without any interference the date and activities of the Private Enterprise Day.(i) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the right of occupational organisations to hold meetings in their premises without advance authorisation and without interference by the authorities is a fundamental aspect of freedom of association.(j) The Committee also notes that according to the Government, on  and  September  no one was arrested for matters related directly with the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically whether the president of COSEP was placed under house arrest on  September  (""Private Enterprise Day""), as alleged by the complainant and, if so, the reasons.(k) The Committee observes that Decrees Nos.  and  proclaiming a state of national emergency with the subsequent restrictions on civil and trade union freedoms should have expired at the end of October . The Committee expresses the firm hope that these restrictions will not be re- imposed and requests the Government to furnish information on the subject.

The Committee also deplores that the latest information supplied by the Government concerning the detention",0,1982,Nicaragua
139,"of trade unionists was only received by the Committee during its present meeting.a) In Case No.  the Committee notes that Mr. Mora has been pardoned and that Mr. Snchez has been sentenced for activities unconnected with freedom of association.b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied regarding the imprisonment of three trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, the names of which are annexed to the present report, and on the refusal to register the executive committees of the agricultural unions of Ftima and Las Mojarras in El Jicaral (department of Len) and of La Concepcin in Matagalpa, and of the unions of service station workers in Chinandega and Managua.c) In Case No.  the Committee notes that of the  trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, six have been released and three have received prison sentences.

.The Committee has examined this case on three occasions (see nd Report, paras.  to , rd Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd, th and th Sessions in March , February-March and May-June  respectively); on the last occasion it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government has sent certain information in a communication received in the Office in January .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that the Government denies that copies of by-laws were printed on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead and deposited at the headquarters of the Sandinista Central of Workers for the purpose of facilitating the registration of the recently constituted organisations among the Central's members. In support of this statement the Government adduces the fact that the complainants have not sent copies of the paper allegedly bearing the letterhead. The Committee notes that the Government also denies that the passport of the trade union leader, Alejandro Arnuero, was withdrawn and points out that he is at present living in Costa Rica. The Government also denies that Eugenio Membreo or other members of the CTN executive committee are being threatened or intimidated. The Committee also notes that the Government will transmit the results of the embezzlement proceedings against the trade union organisation SEEOMC as soon as the judgement is handed down.
.As regards the allegations relating to the search of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the alleged attacks on the leaders of this organisation, the Committee notes that, according to the Government's statements, two trade union leaders hid in the headquarters of FETRACHI after engaging in acts against public order (which the Government describes as offences), were arrested there by the state security forces and released a few days afterwards. The Committee notes that the Government has not indicated specifically what the acts against public order alleged to have been engaged in by these leaders consisted of or whether the stare security forces had a judicial warrant to enter the premises. In these circumstances the Committee wishes to recall generally the principle that the right of inviolability of union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities should not enter such premises without having obtained a judicial warrant to do so. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Chile), para. .)
.As regards the allegations that rural workers of Wasaca affiliated to the CTN have been interrogated and threatened with imprisonment, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, when a member of the counter-revolutionary forces is captured, the CTN at once alleges that he is a member or a leader of its organisation. Concerning this allegation, the Committee wishes to point out that the complainants did not give the names of the persons who were allegedly interrogated and threatened, nor the period during which these events are alleged to have occurred, and accordingly considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.As regards the alleged imprisonment of trade unionists, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Messrs. Agustn Canales, Mnico Fuentes, Nicols Gonzlez, Santos Ponce, Victoriano Ramos, Saturnino Lpez and Santos Larios Cornejo are neither trade unionists nor in prison; the first does not appear on the prison records, the second was released in February  and the others in December . Since the Government has not indicated the concrete facts warranting the arrest of the six persons whose subsequent release was confirmed, the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union leaders and members of their freedom constitute a serious risk of interference in union activities and, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the pri-nciples of freedom of association. (See rd Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. .) The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete acts which gave rise to the arrest of these persons.
.Lastly, in connection with the imprisonment of  trade union leaders or members (whose names are listed in Annex II), the Committee notes that the Government states that it needs additional information in order to be able to reply (workplace and present whereabouts, office held and union to which they belong, place and date of the arrest and the grounds for it). The Committee requests the complainants to provide as many details as they can obtain about these persons in the sense indicated by the Government. The Committee nevertheless wishes to point out to the Government that the complainants had already provided a number of elements of information regarding the arrests concerned, in particular their date and place (see rd Report, paras.  and ), for which reason the Committee considers that the Government should be in a position to reply to these allegations at an early date.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) Regarding the search of the headquarters of FETRACHI, the Committee wishes to recall generally the principle that the right of inviolability of union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities should not enter such premises without having obtained a judicial warrant to do so.(b) Bearing in mind that the Government has not indicated the precise facts warranting the arrest of six persons (mentioned in Annex I) whose subsequent release it confirms, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union leaders and members of their freedom constitute a serious risk of interference in union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete acts which gave rise to the arrest of these six persons.(c) Regarding the imprisonment of  trade union leaders and members (mentioned in Annex II), the Committee notes that the Government states that it needs additional information in order to be able to reply (workplace and present whereabouts, office held and union to which they belong, place and date of the arrest and grounds for it). The Committee requests the complainants to provide as many details about these persons as they can obtain in the sense indicated by",1,1982,Nicaragua
140,"the Government. The Committee nevertheless wishes to point out to the Government that the complainants have already provided a number of elements of information regarding the arrests concerned, in particular their date and place (see rd Report, paras.  and ), for which reason the Committee considers that the Government should be in a position to reply to these allegations at an early date.(d) The Committee notes that the Government will transmit the results of the embezzlement proceedings against the trade union organisation SEEOMC as soon as the judgement is handed down.
.The Committee has examined this case on two occasions [see nd Report, paras.  to  and rd Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd and th Sessions in March  and February-March , respectively]; on the last occasion, it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government sent certain information in a communication dated  February , received by the office after the Committee's February-March  meeting.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined this case at its February-March  meeting, it made the following recommendations on the allegations still pending [see rd Report, para. ).(a) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has been recommending trade union organisations to join the Sandinista Central of Workers (CST) and that copies of the by-laws of trade union organisations, on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead, have been deposited at the headquarters of the CST so that it can register the recently constituted organisations among its members.(b) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that SEEOMC leader Alejandro Arnuero, who was to take part in a congress of the International Transport Workers' Federation in Brazil, had his passport withdrawn without any valid reason. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the final decision handed down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgment handed down on the granting of legal personality to the trade union of workers in various undertakings in the sugar sector (""Faustino Martnez"" and others) so that it can reach conclusions on the allegations with all relevant information at its disposal.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the searching of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the use of aggression against its leaders.(f) The Committee regrets that the Government has not indicated the precise grounds for the arrest of a number of trade unionists who have now been released but merely gives the name of the Act that they are said to have contravened; it again requests the Government to transmit information on this matter.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the information passed on by the CTN to the Director-General's representative concerning seven trade unionists (Mnico Fuentes, Nicols Gonzlez, Santos Ponce Santacruz, Victoriano Ramos, Agustn Canales, Saturnino Lpez Centeno and Santos Larios Cornejo) who, contrary to the claims of the Government, are allegedly still in custody. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations concerning arrests to which it has not replied, involving  trade union leaders or members. Crescencio Carranza, Guillermo Salmern Jimnez, Fidel Lpez Martnez, Rito Rivas Amador, Jos Angel Altamirano, Mercedes Hernndez, Reynaldo Blandn, Ivn Blandn, Vctor Ros, Erik Luna, Jos Angel Pealosa, Napolen Aragn, Elezar Marenco, Juan Ramn Duarte and his brother, Anacleto Rayo Torres, Ricardo Meza Salgado, Cndido Arbizu Ocn, Candelario Jarqun Miranda, Alejo Flores Castillo, Miguel Flores Castillo, Nicols Orozco Martnez, Esteban Orozco Martnez, Mximino Flores Obando, Estanislao Cano Mayorga, Jos Miranda Prez, Anastasio Jimnez Maldonado, Gabriel Jimnez Maldonado, Arcadio Ortiz Espinoza, Santos Snchez Cortedano, Jacinto Snchez Cortedano, Napolen Molina Aguilera and Juan Rivas (according to a communication from the WCL, the latter has already been released).(h) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations that rural workers of WASACA affiliated to the CTN have been interrogated and threatened with imprisonment and that Eugenio Membreo and other members of the CTN Executive Committee have been threatened and intimidated in their homes. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.
.With respect to the list of detained persons submitted by the complainants, the Government supplies the following information:- Santos and Jacinto Snchez Cortedano. These persons are serving two year prison sentences, imposed by the Examining Magistrate, for stealing livestock (rustling).- Cndido Arbizu Ocn, Alejo Flores Castillo, Candelario Jarqun Miranda, Esteban Orozco Martnez, Anacleto Rayo Torres, Eleuterio Cano Mayorga, Miguel Angel Flores Castillo, Ricardo Meza Salgado, Nicols Orozco Martnez. These persons were arrested on  December  in Las Mojarras (Department of Len) for infringing the Act on the maintenance of public law and order. They belong to the Nicaraguan Democratic Front (FDN), a military organisation which continually makes attacks on Nicaragua from Honduras and which, in accordance with the above-mentioned Act, is an illegal organisation. They were returned to the Free Trade Zone on  February .- Jos Eliodoro Prez Miranda was arrested on  July  and returned to the Free Trade Zone on  October . He was accused of boycotting transport units by throwing sharp objects on the roads, thereby committing the offence stipulated in section () of the Act on the maintenance of public law and - order.- Manuel Antonio Cano Zeledn. This person was arrested on  November  and released on  November.- Orlando Mendoza Laguna, Arcadio Antonio Ortiz Espinoza and Orlando Napolen Martnez Aguilera. These persons are members of the Nicaraguan Democratic Front (FDN), an illegal armed organisation. They were arrested on  November , charged with providing information concerning Nicaragua's military and economic objectives to this organisation, thereby committing an offence as stipulated by section (b) of the Act on the maintenance of public law and order.- Bismarck Antonio Garca Estrada. This person was arrested on  November  for having connections with the above-mentioned persons, but he was released on  January , having proven that he had not participated in the activities mentioned in the previous paragraph.
.The Government states that these persons were not arrested either for belonging to the CTN or on account of their trade union functions.
.With respect to the trade union leaders in the firm ""Aceitera Corona S.A."", Juan Rivas and Miguel Angel Salgado, the Government sent many documents from which it appears that their dismissal was based on a serious professional misdemeanour, within the scope of just causes for dismissal as laid down in section () of the Labour Code (for non-fulfilment of contractual obligations); the trade union leaders in question were accused of being responsible for the loss of large quantities of oil. Furthermore, the Labour Inspectorate confirmed that there was a just cause for dismissal, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, applicable to trade union leaders. The Government states that these persons were not arrested on trade union grounds, a version which has just been upheld in a letter signed by three officials of their trade union, which also mentions that Mr. Rivas and Mr. Salgado have been released.
.Lastly, the Government encloses the text of the judgment handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice, on  January , in which this Court states that the request for legal personality from the trade union of workers in various undertakings in the sugar sector - ""Faustino Martnez"", ""Refinera Nicaragense del Azcar"" and ""Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited"" - does not comply with the requirements laid down in clause (c) of section  of the Labour Code (that the trade unions should be in different undertakings, made up of workers with different occupations, functions or skills, which provide their services in one or several undertakings of the same category), since although the Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited and the ""Refinera Nicaragense del Azcar"" formally describe themselves as several companies, they are one and the same undertaking; this is proven by the fact that they have the same general manager, are engaged in the same activity and pursue identical social objectives, that they have three machine repair workshops which provide common services and share the same data processing centre. According to the above-mentioned text sent by the Government, the Supreme Court interprets the term ""undertaking"" contained in section  of the Labour Code as referring to an involvement in a basically economic activity and points out that the legal concept of undertaking does not apply to its form, but to its real engagement in an economic activity.
.With respect to the allegations concerning arrests, the Committee notes that, according to the Government's statements, Santos and Jacinto Snchez Cortedano, Cndido Arbizu Ocn, Alejandro Flores Castillo, Candelario Jarqun Miranda,",0,1982,Nicaragua
141,"Esteban Orozco Martnez, Anacleto Rayo Torres, Eleuterio Cano Mayorga, Miguel Angel Flores Castillo, Ricardo Meza Salgado, Nicols Orozco Martnez, Jos Eliodoro Prez Miranda, Orlando Mendoza Laguna, Arcadio Antonio Ortz Espinoza and Orlando Martnez Aguilera were arrested on grounds independent from their trade union activities (stealing of livestock, belonging to or acting on behalf of military or armed organisations of an illegal and non-union character, or boycotting of transport units). The Committee also notes that three officials of the trade union to which Juan Rivas and Miguel Salgado belong have stated in writing that those in question were not arrested for trade union reasons.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, Manuel Cano Zeledn was arrested on  November  and released on  November, and that Bismarck Garcia Estrada, arrested on  November , was released on  January , having proven that he had not provided information on Nicaragua's military and economic objectives to an illegal military organisation. The Committee regrets that the Government did not mention the grounds upon which Manuel Cano Zeledn was arrested. Nevertheless, as this person has now been released and taking into account that it is not clear whether any charges were upheld against him, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that preventive detention of trade union officials and trade unionists involves a serious risk of interference into trade union activities.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government has not provided the information it had been requested to give on the other allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists. Consequently, the Committee again requests the Government to send it its observations on the information provided by the CTN to the Director-General's representative on seven trade unionists (Mnico Fuentes, Nicols Gonzlez, Santos Ponce Santacruz, Victoriano Ramos, Agustn Canales, Saturnino Lpez Centeno and Santos Larios Cornejo) who, contrary to what the Government maintains, were arrested [see rd Report, para. ]. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations of arrests to which it has not replied, involving the following  union leaders or members: Crescencio Carranza, Guillermo Salmern Jimnez, Fidel Lpez Martnez, Rito Rivas Amador, Jos Angel Altamirano, Mercedes Hernndez, Reynaldo Blandn, Ivn Blandn, Victor Ros, Erik Luna, Jos Angel Pealosa, Napolen Aragn, Elezar Marenco, Juan Ramn Duarte and his brother, Maximino Flores Obando, Anastasio Jimnez, Maldonado and Gabriel Jimnez, Maldonado.
.With respect to the difficulties encountered by the trade union of workers in various undertakings in the sugar sector - ""Faustino Martnez, ""Refinera del Azcar"" and ""Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited"" - in trying to obtain legal personality, the Committee notes the judgment handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice, on  January , in which it states that the request for legal personality from this trade union does not fulfil the requirements stipulated in clause (c) of section  of the Labour Code (that the trade unions should be in different undertakings, made up of workers with different occupations, functions and skills, which provide services in two or more undertakings of the same category).The Committee notes that, according to the judgment, the Supreme Court considers that the ""Refinera del Azcar S.A."" and the ""Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited"", in spite of being different companies, constitute a single undertaking, in so far as they are engaged in the same activities, pursue identical objectives and have a general manager in common, etc. The Supreme Court therefore views an undertaking from an economic standpoint; in otherwords, it considers it to be a single unit of production. In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the union of workers in the sugar sector ""Faustino Martinez"" might very soon obtain legal personality as a works union (section (b) of the Labour Code).
.Finally, the Committee reiterates its request for information from the Government concerning the remaining allegations, as it did in its previous Session [see above in the section concerning the previous examination of the case, the paragraphs preceded by the letters (a), (b), (c), (e) and (h)].
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions;(a) The Committee notes that, according to the information provided' by the Government,  of the persons to whom the Committee referred were arrested on grounds that had nothing to do with their trade union activities.(b) The Committee regrets that the Government did not indicate the grounds upon which the trade unionist Manuel Cano Zeledn, now released, was arrested. As it is not clear whether any charges were upheld against this person, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the preventive detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists involves a serious risk of interference into trade union activities.(c) The Committee again requests the Government to send its observations on the information given by the CTN to the Director-General's representative on seven trade unionists (Mnico Fuentes, Nicols Gonzlez, Santos Ponce Santacruz, Victoriano Ramos, Agustin Canales, Saturnino Lpez Centeno and Santos Larios Cornejo) who, contrary to what the Government maintains, were arrested [see rd Report, para. ]. The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations of arrest to which it has not replied, involving the following  trade union leaders or members: Crescencio Carranza, Guillermo Salmern Jimnez, Fidel Lpez Martnez, Rito Rivas Amador, Jos Angel Altamirano, Mercedes Hernndez, Reynaldo Blandn, Ivn Blandn, Victor Rios, Erik Luna, Jos Angel Pealosa, Napoleon Aragn, Elezar Marenco, Juan Ramn Duarte and his brother, Maximino Flores Obando, Anastasio Jimnez, Maldonado and Gabriel Jimnez, Maldonado.(d) The Committee again requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has been recommending trade union organisations to join the Sandinista Central of Workers (CST) and that copies of by-laws of trade union organisations, on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead, have been deposited at the headquarters of the CST so that it can register the recently constituted organisations among its members.(e) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that SEEOMC leader Alejandro Arnuero, who was to take part in a congress of the International Transport Workers' Federation in Brazil, had his passport withdrawn without any valid reason. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(f) The Committee again requests the Government to send the text of the final decision handed down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.(g) The Committee again requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the searching of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the use of aggression against its leaders.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following recommendations:
.General recommendations(a) The Committee appreciates the spirit of co-operation that the Government has demonstrated by accepting that the Director-General's representative, during the direct contacts mission, could examine with the authorities the various aspects of the cases which were still pending and seek further information on them. The Committee observes that, thanks to the information obtained by the Director-General's representative, it has been able to examine a substantial number of the allegations to which the Government had not replied. However, the Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied detailed information on certain outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the statement made by the Deputy Minister concerning the content of the complaints the Committee recalls that even if, in certain instances, the allegations have lacked some precision, it is required to examine them in all objectivity and to seek to obtain a maximum of information concerning them.(c) The Committee wishes to express its serious concern at the large number of leaders and members of workers' and employers' organisations who have been arrested. The Committee considers that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights and in particular, the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, are fully respected and guaranteed.(d) The Committee observes from its examination of certain allegations and of the information supplied by the Government and from the mission report that acts of hostility between union organisations or within individual organisations occur rather frequently. The Committee considers that freedom of association implies the right of workers' and employers' organisations to resolve any difficulties by themselves, and without interference by the authorities; the Committee also considers that it is for the Government to create an atmosphere conducive to the resolution of such difficulties.
.Recommendations as to individual casesCase No. (a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied the text of the judgment handed down by the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of employer leader Salazar Argello which was handed down some time ago; it urges the Government to transmit this judgment at an early date.(b) The Committee notes with interest that the public prosecutor aid not bring any penal charges against certain employer leaders for offences against the security of the State and other offences. The Committee would recall that the",-1,1982,Nicaragua
142,"preventive detention of leaders of workers' or employers' organisations for activities connected with the exercise of their rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) As regards the composition of the Council of State, the Committee considers that participation of workers' and employers' organisations in the Council should imply the strict application of criteria on the basis of which the representativity of these organisations may be determined; moreover, the participation of these organisations in the Council should not deprive other organisations of their right to defend the interests of their members.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take up the suggestion of the Director-General's representative that the Ministry responsible for agrarian reform should obtain further information and be informed of the allegations that members of the CTN have been physically attacked by the authorities on state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations and that sugar workers affiliated to the CTN have been prevented from entering their work centres; the Committee also requests the complainant to transmit any further information it may have concerning this matter.(b) The Committee requests the Government to call for an investigation of the alleged threats by official militias against the lives of trade union leaders (specifically, Luis Mora and Salvador Snchez) and to keep it informed of its findings.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has been recommending trade union organisations to join the Sandinista Central of Workers (CST) and that copies of the by-laws of trade union organisations, on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead, have been deposited at the headquarters of the CST so that it can register the recently constituted organisations among its members.(b) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that SEEOMC leader Alejandro Arnuero, who was to take part in a congress of the International Transport Workers' Federation in Brazil, had his passport withdrawn without any valid reason. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the final decision handed down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgment handed down on the granting of legal personality to the trade union of workers in various undertakings in the sugar sector (""Faustino Martinez"" and others) so that it can reach conclusions on the allegations with all relevant information at its disposal.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the searching of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the use of aggression against its leaders.(f) The Committee regrets that the Government has not indicated the precise grounds for the arrest of a number of trade unionists who have now been released but merely gives the name o the Act that they are said to have contravened; it again requests the Government to transmit information on this matter.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the information passed on by the CTN to the Director-General's representative concerning seven trade unionists who, contrary to the claims of the Government, are allegedly still in custody.The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations concerning arrests to which it has not replied, involving  union leaders or members.(h) In general terms, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures designed to deprive persons of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(i) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations that rural workers of WASACA affiliated to the CTN have been interrogated and threatened with imprisonment and that Eugenio Membreo and other members of the CTN executive committee have been threatened and intimidated in their homes. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(j) The Committee considers that no further examination need be made of the allegations relating to the coercion of Denis Maltes; the persecution and harassment of Zacaras Hernndez and Isabel Somarriba; the interference in the SEEOMC meeting on  December ; the detention of  trade union leaders and members of SEEOMC; and the physical attacks and threats against leaders of the CUS due to the SEEOMC meeting called for  May .Case No. (a) The Committee notes with interest that the General Labour Inspectorate has ordered the reinstatement of eight trade unionists employed by ENABUS who, according to the complainants, were dismissed for being members of an organisation affiliated to the CTN.(b) The Committee requests the complainants to send further details regarding the alleged destruction of the premises of the rural workers' union in Rio Grande and Las Mojarras (Department of Len) and to indicate exactly in which locality the five leaders of the Union of Workers of the Hacienda El Progreso were dismissed on  January  and prevented from returning to work despite a court order to reinstate them (according to the Government, there are over a hundred plantations under the name of ""El Progreso"").(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied, involving the union leader Hermgenes Aguirre Largaespada and trade unionist Larry Lee Shoures and the arrest of trade unionist Abelino Gonzlez, Piz.Case No. (a) Since there is no record of any charges having been brought against the persons concerned, the Committee regrets that four union leaders should have been held in custody for a long time and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the preventive detention of union leaders entails a serious risk of interference in the activities of trade union organisations.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Salomn Daz Fernndez is being held for counter-revolutionary activities and requests the Government to indicate whether he is still in custody and to specify the precise charges brought against him.
.Under the signature of the Disputes Secretary, the Trade Union of Dockers, Employees and Office Staff of Corinto Docks (SEEOMC) presented a complaint in a communication dated  November  and sent additional information in a communication dated  December . The Government replied in a communication dated  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Disputes Secretary of the SEEOMC, Mr. Zacarias Hernndez, in his capacity as union leader, alleges in a communication of  November  that Denis Maltes Lugo and Alejandro Arnuero, respectively Financial Secretary and Secretary for Social Affairs of the SEEOMC, were arrested on  November  at  a.m. by the State Security chief and second-in-command of the harbour police, without his family or organisation being informed of his whereabouts. According to the complainant, they were arrested simply for having requested compliance with the ILO' international Conventions on freedom of association and as a result of collusion between the labour and police authorities and the manager of the harbour enterprise. Mr. Zacarias Hernndez further alleges that he is currently a refugee in San Jos, Costa Rica, a victim of the State Security forces' persecution of the defenders of freedom of association.
.In his communication dated  December , the complainant adds that State Security forces arrested Felipe Alonso, President of the Vigilance Board of the SEEOMC, on  December, since when neither his whereabouts nor the charges against him have been communicated. In addition, a trade union leader, Isabel Somarrita, was obliged to leave the country owing to the systematic harassment of the State Security forces and manager of the harbour enterprise. Mr. Hernndez goes on to state further that, although Denis Maltes Lugo has now been released, it is on condition that he relinquish his trade union post and take no further part in the activities of the organisation.
.Finally, Mr. Zacarias Hernndez alleges that the Ministry of Labour, manoeuvred by the manager of the harbour enterprise and State Security chief, authorised the rest of the executive committee to convene an extraordinary general meeting on  December  in order to appoint persons not affiliated to the trade union to an executive body sympathetic to the political interests of the Government, against the will of the union's members.
.In its communication dated  February , the Government states that, in an official declaration issued on  January , the SEEOMC denied Mr. Hernndez the right to represent it and bore witness to the freedom of association of workers in Nicaragua and to the fact that the persons concerned had not been arrested in their capacity as trade union leaders but for other reasons. According to the Government, the declaration, which was issued spontaneously and freely by the union in question, denounced the manoeuvring of",1,1982,Nicaragua
143,"certain workers who, through their statements or activities, were endeavouring to cause problems for the Government, undermine the honesty and patriotism of other union members and present a bad image of the Government to world opinion.
.The Government sends the text of the SEEOMC declaration in which the following statements are made:that this trade union denies Mr. Zacarias Hernndez Bustamente any authority to act on its behalf in view of the fact that he left the union on  August  to join the ranks of the CIA and counter-revolutionary forces operating outside the country; that the complaint presented to the ILO is merely one further defamatory campaign sponsored by the CIA against the popular Sandinista Revolution. The declaration further states that Felipe Alonso and Alejandro Arnuero, who are innocent and at present released, were not arrested in their capacity as union leaders but for having been involved by Mr. Hernndez in his counter-revolutionary activities.
.The Government also encloses a communication from the SEEOMC dated  December  showing that an extraordinary general assembly was held on  December  at which an. Executive Board was elected for the whole of .
.The Committee takes note of the allegations of the complainant and of the Government's reply. The Committee notes in particular that, according to the documentation sent by the Government, the union leaders, Felipe Alonso and Alejandro Arnuero have been released and that they were arrested not in their capacity as union leaders but for having been involved by Mr. Zacarias Hernndez in his counter-revolutionary activities. The Committee also notes that, according to the complainant, Denis Maltes Lugo has been released but on condition that he relinquish his trade union post and take no further part in the activities of the organisation.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not indicated the precise grounds for the arrest of the union leaders, Denis Maltes Lugo' Felipe Alonso and Alejandro Arnuero, but has merely sent the text of a declaration issued by the SEEOMC asserting in general terms that Felipe Alonso and Alejandro Arnuero had been arrested for their involvement in counter-revolutionary activities, which cannot be considered as a sufficiently derailed reply. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate the precise grounds for the arrest of these three union leaders so that it can rule on the case in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee moreover observes that the Government has not replied to the other allegations: namely, the use of coercion to make the trade union leader, Denis Maltes Lugo, relinquish his union post, the departure from the country of union leaders Zacaras Hernndez and Isabel Somarriba because of the persecution and harassment by the State Security forces, and collusion between the authorities and management of the harbour enterprise to authorise the convening of an extraordinary general assembly of the SEEOMC to appoint persons not affiliated to the trade union to an executive body sympathetic to the political interests of the Government, against the will of the members of the union. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on these allegations.
.In addition, the Committee would like to have more information on the serious accusations made in the declaration of the SEEOMC against Mr. Zacaras Hernndez.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) While noting that the trade union leaders, Denis Maltes Lugo, Felipe Alonso and Alejandro Arnuero have now been released, the Committee requests the Government to indicate the precise grounds for their arrest.(b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied: namely, the use of coercion to make the trade union leader, Denis Maltes Lugo, relinquish his union post, the departure from the country of union leaders Zacaras Hernndez and Isabel Somarriba because of the persecution and harassment by the state Security forces, and collusion between the authorities and management of the harbour enterprise to authorise the convening of an extraordinary general assembly of the SEEOMC to appoint persons not affiliated to the trade union to an executive body sympathetic to the political interests of the Government, against the will of the members of the union.(c) The Committee would like to have more information on the serious accusations made in the declaration of the SEEOMC against Mr. Zacaras Hernndez.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1982,Nicaragua
144,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the ""Jeremas Tadeo Morazn Kuant"" Trade Union of Employees of Texaco Caribbean Inc, dated  September . This organisation sent additional information in a communication dated  November . The Government replied in a communication dated  November .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September  the ""Jeremas Tadeo Morazn Kuant"" Trade Union of Employees of Texaco Caribbean Inc alleges that, although  of the  employees of Texaco Caribbean Inc signed the founding document of this trade union on  July  and its constitution on  July , the authorities have not yet resolved whether or not to accord legal personality despite successive efforts and letters directed to this end, in contradiction of the provisions of section  of the Labour Code which gives the Department of Trade Union Associations a period of ten days to announce its decision on the matter.
.From the documents submitted by the complainant it emerges that the already existing trade union (the Trade Union of Petrochemical, Related and Similar Workers, Texaco Section - STIPEDS - affiliated to the Sandinista Central of Workers) opposed the creation of the new trade union, saw the number of its own members reduced to  in view of the numbers who had resigned their membership, and was notified in September  of a request submitted by the new trade union to the judicial authorities for the dissolution of the STIPEDS, since the Labour Code stipulates that works unions can only be constituted if they comprise an absolute majority of the workers in the respective undertaking.
.In its communication of  November  the complainant organisation states that on  October it was registered by the Department of Trade Union Associations and was able to obtain legal personality. The complainant organisation expresses its thanks to the ILO for the co-operation extended in the matter.
.In its communication of  November , the Government declares that whenever the Department of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour receives a request from trade unions for registration and the granting of legal personality, such request is examined to ascertain that none of the relevant legal provisions in force is being violated. The Government adds that in the case submitted by the complainant organisation there were circumstances that were not clear once these doubts had been cleared up the ""Jeremas Tadeo Morazn Kuant"" Trade Union was registered on  October  and it was granted legal personality.
.The Committee notes with interest that the ""Jeremas Tadeo Morazn Kuant"" Trade Union of Employees of Texaco Caribbean Inc was registered by the Department of Trade Union Associations of the Ministry of Labour on  October  and was granted legal personality.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the delay in registering and granting legal personality to this union (requested at the end of July ) was due to a number of circumstances which were not clear. The Committee observes in this connection that from the documents sent by the complainant it emerges in any event that in September  a request was submitted to the judicial authorities for the dissolution of the previously existing trade union (STIPEDS), whose membership had dropped below the number required by the law. In these circumstances, since the ""Jeremas Tadeo Morazn Kuant"" Trade Union of Employees of Texaco Caribbean Inc has been granted legal personality, the Committee considers that this case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1982,Nicaragua
145,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) sent a complaint of violations of trade union rights in Nicaragua in a communication dated  July . It supplied additional information in a letter of  September . The Government sent its observations in communications dated  and  September .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Fight to Organise Convention  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July  the ICFTU alleges the arrest, on  July, of Javier Prez Altamirano, a member of the ICFTU affiliate in Nicaragua, the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS). It states that, since his arrest, Mr. Altamirano has been kept in arbitrary detention, and it requests the ILO to help in obtaining his immediate release.
.In its further communication, the ICFTU states that at . p.m. on  July  three armed men wearing civilian clothes arrested Mr. Altamirano, the secretary of the CUS. Mr. Altamirano was allegedly taken to an unknown destination. His home was then broken into by seven members of the Sandinist Popular Army and/or the Sandinist Police who proceeded to confiscate documents and Mr. Altamirano's personal property without a warrant to do so. According to the ICFTU, his wife inquired at the P- police station as to the whereabouts of her husband and was informed only eight days later of his place of detention. It appears that Mr. Altamirano is presently held in Len City, in a confinement centre called Quinta ""Y"", under a State Security order. The ICFTU states that the only reason for his arbitrary imprisonment is that he is a leader of the CUS trade union. Lastly, the complainant points out that the CBS has protested and taken steps to obtain his release through petitioning the Government and various Ministers; no replies have, however, been received to these pleas.
.In its communication of  September , the Government states that Mr. Prez Altamirano was released on  August .
.In its communication of  September , the Government explains that Mr. Altamirano had been detained for instigating strikes in the banana plantations of the western region of the country in violation of the law declaring a state of national emergency.
.The Committee notes that, while the arrest of the trade union leader, Mr. Prez Altamirano, is not disputed, the reasons given for his arrest are contradictory. The complainant states that the arrest was for the sole reason that he is a leader of its affiliate in Nicaragua, whereas according to the Government he was arrested for instigating strikes in the banana plantations of the western region in violation of the law declaring a state of national emergency and has since been released. The Committee further notes the complainant's allegations that Mr. Altamirano's house was broken into and his documents and personal property confiscated by armed men belonging either to the army or the police.
.While observing that the Government does not specifically reply to the latter allegations, the Committee notes the Government's statement that Mr. Prez Altamirano was released on  August . It also notes, however, the Government's statement that he had been detained for instigating strikes in violation of the National Emergency Act. The Committee has examined this legislation within the context of Case No.  in the present report and would repeat its findings in that case, namely that such legislation - which suspends the right to strike and imposes a system of compulsory arbitration for settling labour disputes - constitutes a major restriction on one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests. Moreover, the Committee would add that the arrest of a trade union leader for instigating what is considered to be an illegal strike should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied without delay. In the present case, it appears that Mr. Prez Altamirano was released without having been brought before the appropriate judicial authority. The Committee therefore draws the Government's attention to the importance of this fundamental right for the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, in particular the following conclusion:As regards the arrest of Mr. Prez Altamirano, secretary of the CUS, while noting the Government's statement that he has been released, the Committee would recall that legislation such as that under which he was detained constitutes a major restriction on one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests. It also draws the Government's attention to the importance which it attaches to the principle that arrested trade union leaders should be brought before the appropriate judicial authorities without delay and that the safeguards of normal judicial procedures should be applied.",0,1982,Nicaragua
146,".The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Nicaragua in a communication dated  May . The Government forwarded its observations on the content of the complaint in a communication of  June . The complainant forwarded further information in a communication dated  September .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Fight to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU alleges that the Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua systematically violates the principles of freedom of association de jure and de facto. Thus, the complainant organisation explains, at the legislative level the Government issued Legislative Decree No.  on  September  declaring a state of economic and social emergency. The effect of this text is that strikes are considered as a crime against the economic and social security of the nation. Anyone who instigates, promotes or takes part in a strike, a work stoppage or the occupation of a work centre is punishable under section (f) by from one to three years' imprisonment. Furthermore, on  December , the Government adopted Legislative Decree No.  suspending the provisions relating to strikes and work stoppages and concerning machinery for settling economic and social disputes. This Legislative Decree suspends the sections of the Labour Code relating to strikes and ""all provisions relating to strikes and work stoppages contained in Acts, regulations, collective agreements, arbitration decisions and internal work rules as long as the Legislative Decree declaring the state of economic and social emergency remains in force"".
.In addition, the complainant organisation explains that, in fact, workers in various branches of activity are allegedly suffering harassment and reprisals. More precisely, according to the ICFTU, the workers of the ""Sap Antonio"" sugar enterprise, the great majority of whom belonged to the Sandinist Confederation of Workers and who had recently decided to leave it and to join the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS), had allegedly been threatened by the leaders of the Sandinist Confederation and the authorities who, it is alleged, informed them that they must disaffiliate from the CUS unless they wished to be considered as enemies of the revolution and suffer the consequences.
.Similarly, the drivers of Chinandega, taxi drivers and road hauliers, who held a general meeting to decide on joining one of the three major national trade union confederations, chose the CUS by  votes, as against  for the Sandinist Confederation and  for the Central of Workers of Nicaragua. That allegedly led the authorities to adopt measures of intimidation against the trade union leaders of the CUS, and the General Secretary of that union, it is claimed, was disqualified from driving.
.Finally, the workers belonging to the Federation of Agricultural Workers of Chinandega were also allegedly harassed merely for having affiliated to the CUS.
.As regards section  of Decree No.  which made participation in strikes punishable by imprisonment, the Government points out in its communication of  June  that under section  of Decree No.  of  March  issuing a National Emergency Act and published in No.  of the Official Gazette of  March , Legislative Decree No.  declaring a state of economic and social emergency was repealed. In other words, the Government states, when the ICFTU presented its complaint, the Decree in question had no longer been in force for six weeks.
.Regarding Decree No.  concerning the suspension of the provisions relating to strikes and work stoppages and concerning machinery for settling economic and social disputes, the Government admits that the text is still in force, as is Decree No.  of  February . The Government claims that these texts establish a flexible procedure for settling economic and social disputes on a temporary basis. In fact, the Government explains that in spite of the declaration of the state of national emergency, the decrees concerning collective bargaining continue to be applied without restriction, but without recourse to strikes and using the conciliation and arbitration machinery.
.Then, generally describing the situation, the Government states that the whole world is aware of the threats to the country and that its enemies, both within and without, have drawn up plans of aggression aiming at gravely endangering economic and social stability by acts of sabotage and other violent actions intended to disturb the peace and to destroy the country's production system and infrastructure. It goes on to say that these plans are being put into effect, as is proved by the destruction of a bridge on the Rio Negro, situated on the road leading to the frontier post of El Guasaule, in the Province of Chinandega, and by the partial destruction of the Ocotal bridge in the Province of Nueva Segovia. Other incidents should also be emphasised, such as the attempts to blow up the national cement factory and the oil refinery in the city of Managua, and the terrorist bomb attacks on an Aeronica aircraft at Mexico City airport and at the Augusto Csar Sandino airport terminal in Managua.
.Consequently, the Government explains that it had to impose throughout the country a state of emergency and the suspension of several rights and guarantees conferred by the Constitution contained in Decree No.  of  August , including the suspension of the right to strike and to stop work; the Government points out that the suspension was temporary. The state of emergency is extended month by month as long as the reasons therefore subsist. At the time of its communication, the Government furnished the texts under the terms of which the state of emergency was extended from  May to  June . It affirms that it does not intend to breach the international obligations resulting from the ratification of ILO Conventions and reiterates that only serious reasons of state led it to suspend the right to strike on a temporary basis. The junta's policy, it asserts, can rely on the strong and total support of the labour and peasants' organisations and those of the workers in general, apart from that of a certain minority trade union group which is playing the game of the interests of the enemies of Nicaragua's revolutionary process, acting from outside and inside.
.More specifically, on the complainant's grievance to the effect that workers of the ""San Antonio"" sugar enterprise who belonged to the Sandinist Confederation of Workers (CST) had allegedly recently decided to leave it and join the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) and had suffered reprisals by the leaders of the Sandinist Confederation and the authorities, the Government explains that originally (in ) a union had been founded by  workers. Subsequently, in , although the enterprise employed over , workers, this union had won the membership of  workers. According to the Government, the union was affiliated to the official General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and its officers followed a policy of complicity with the arbitrary rule and corruption of the former system. After the triumph of the revolution, the first general meeting of the , workers at the enterprise swept away the old corrupt trade union leadership. Later, the workers decided to change the name of their union to the ""Ronald Altamiro Revolutionary Union of Workers of the San Antonio Sugar Enterprise"". However, on  February ,  workers at the enterprise organised a union which, shortly afterwards, consisted of no more than  of the highest paid workers at the enterprise. They were not threatened by any government authority; the Ministry of Labour simply refused to register them as they failed to meet the conditions laid down by law, the Government states.
.Concerning the alleged threats by the Sandinist Confederation of Workers, this is a false charge according to the Government since, with  per cent of the workers at the enterprise belonging to it, the Ronald Altamiro Revolutionary Union of Workers, affiliated to the CST, does not need to threaten its rival on the contrary, its policy is the complete freedom of affiliation of the workers. Furthermore, the workers of the San Antonio enterprise have not disaffiliated from the Ronald Altamiro Union and the CST. The Government explains that this tiny trade union of  workers continues moreover, to exist and is affiliated to the CUS.
.As regards the grievance relating to the Drivers' Union of Chinandega (SITRAVOCHI), the Government states, first, that the three largest workers' confederations in terms of numbers of members are, in descending order the Sandinist Confederation of Workers (CST), the Association of Rural Workers (ATC) and the General Confederation of Self-Employed Workers (CGTI) and not the Central of Workers of Nicaragua (CTN) and the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS). The CST embraces  per cent of the country's workers, the ATC  per cent, the CGTI . per cent, the CTN . per cent and the CUS . per cent. According to the Government, since  SITRAVOCHI has been affiliated to the Federation of Workers of Chinandega (FETRACHI),",0,1982,Nicaragua
147,"which is affiliated to the CUS. The election referred to in the complaint was held on  December  and only confirmed the continued existence of the union, as shown by the document attached by the Government to its communication.
.As regards the grievance concerning the disqualification of the General Secretary of SITRAVOCHI from driving, on being consulted by the Government, the Chinandega police stated that he was disqualified from driving after he had been stopped three times for speeding and had been found to be drunk.
.As regards the grievance concerning the alleged harassment of members of the Federation of Agricultural Workers of Chinandega (FETRACAMCHI), the complaint indicates neither the authorities responsible nor those who, it is alleged, were actually harassed. The Federation in question did not lodge a complaint with the ministry of Labour, with which, however, it keeps up regular correspondence, as can be seen from the documentation attached to the Government's reply.
.Finally, the Government considers that it has fully demonstrated that the complaint is unfounded. It recalls, further, that trade union organisations in opposition to the revolutionary government, such as the Central of Workers of Nicaragua (CTN), have publicly recognised that the official responsible for associations in the Ministry of Labour recently granted, impartially and conscientiously, legal personality to the Union of Drivers, an opposition trade union, as proved by the press cutting from the newspaper ""La Prensa"" of  February  attached to the Government's communication.
.The complaint alleges legal and factual restrictions on the exercise of trade union rights by the workers of Nicaragua.
.With regard to the general suspension of the right to strike and the imposition of a system of compulsory arbitration for settling labour disputes, the Committee, while noting that Decree No.  which made participation in illegal strikes punishable by up to three years' imprisonment has been repealed, nevertheless notes that the Government itself admits that the right to strike has been temporarily suspended and that labour disputes must be settled by a flexible procedure, without recourse to strikes, by means of conciliation and arbitration machinery. Since, according to the Government, the suspension of the right to strike and the settlement of disputes by arbitration will last as long as the state of economic emergency is in force, and since this state of emergency is renewed month by month because of acts of violence and sabotage, the Committee recalls, as it has pointed out on numerous occasions, that measures of this type constitute a major restriction on one of the essential means whereby the workers and their organisations can promote and defend their interests and that they should be imposed solely as temporary measures in a situation of acute national crisis.
.Consequently, the Committee expresses the firm hope that the Government will take measures to restore the right to strike and to lift the provisions concerning compulsory arbitration apart from that in essential services in the strict sense of the term, that is those whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population. It wishes to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations on this aspect of the case.
.Concerning the allegations relating to the victimisation of the workers of the ""San Antonio"" sugar enterprise for wishing to leave the pro-Government Sandinist Confederation in order to establish a union affiliated to the Confederation of Trade Union Unity, the Committee has taken note of the detailed explanations provided by the Government. It notes, however, that even according to the Government  persons, comprising, allegedly, the highest paid workers in the enterprise, established a union and that the public authorities refused to register it on the ground that the organisation failed to meet the conditions laid down by law.
.Generally speaking, the Committee has recalled on several occasions that the principle of freedom of association might remain a dead letter if employers and workers were required to obtain any previous authorisation to enable them to establish an organisation, be it authorisation concerning the formation of the trade union organisation itself, the need to obtain discretionary approval of the constitutional rules of the organisation, or, again, authorisation for taking steps prior to the establishment of the organisation. This does not mean that the founders of an organisation are freed from the duty of observing formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities which may be prescribed by law. However, such requirements must not be such as to be equivalent in practice to previous authorisation, or as to constitute such an obstacle to the establishment of an organisation that they amount in practice to outright prohibition. Even in cases where registration is optional, if such registration confers on the organisation the basic rights enabling it to ""further and defend the interests"" of its members, the fact that the authority competent to effect the registration has discretionary power to refuse this formality leads to a situation that is not very different from that in cases where previous authorisation is required.
.In the case in point, the Committee has taken cognisance of the legislation of Nicaragua regarding the establishment of a trade union organisation. It notes that under section  of the Labour code, as amended in , a works union can he established only if it comprises the absolute majority of the workers at the work centre. Since, as the Government points out, the Ronald Altamiro Revolutionary Union of Workers of the San Antonio enterprise, affiliated to the Sandinist Confederation of Workers, already represents the interests of the workers in the enterprise, according to the legislation currently in force in Nicaragua, the  workers at the San Antonio sugar enterprise who wished to establish a union therefore met with a refusal on the part of the authorities responsible for registration.
.As was noted by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its observations of  and  on Nicaragua's application of Convention No. , the present section  of the Code, which does not authorise the establishment of a second union in an enterprise, fails to comply with Article  of the Convention, ratified by Nicaragua and guaranteeing workers the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation. Consequently, the Committee requests the Government, as did the Committee of Experts, to amend its legislation on this matter in order to allow the establishment of more than one union in an enterprise if the workers of such enterprise so wish.
.Concerning the Union of Drivers of Chinandega (SITRAVOCHI) and the alleged measures of intimidation against the union leaders, including the disqualification of its General Secretary from driving, on the pretext that the union had recently affiliated to the opposition Confederation (CUS), the Committee has noted the explanations provided by the Government. It appears, according to the Government, that SITRAVOCHI's affiliation to the CUS dates from  and that the results of the elections of  December  merely confirmed the previous situation. Again, the disqualification of the union's General Secretary from driving was stated to have been, according to the police, for speeding and drunken driving. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.Finally, as regards the allegation of harassment suffered by workers of the Federation of Agricultural Workers of Chinandega for belonging to the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) in opposition to the Government, the latter states that the complaint indicates neither the authorities responsible for the harassment, nor those who had actually been harassed, and that the above Federation has not lodged a complaint.
.The complainant organisation consulted on this allegation only states in its communication of  September  that it is not in a position to supply further information because of the obvious fears of the members of that Federation. The Committee therefore does not have sufficient information to continue its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) Concerning the general suspension of the right to strike and the imposition of a compulsory arbitration system to settle labour disputes, the Committee recalls that measures of this type constitute a major restriction on one of the essential means whereby the workers and their organisations can promote and defend their interests, and that they should be imposed solely as temporary measures in a situation of acute national crisis. While noting the Government's statement that these provisions are of a temporary nature, the Committee expresses the firm hope that the Government will take measures to lift these restrictions on the free exercise of freedom of association. It considers it appropriate to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.(b) Concerning the allegation of reprisals against some workers of the ""San Antonio"" sugar enterprise for wishing to leave the pro-Government Confederation and establish an opposition union, the Committee notes that according to the Government itself",0,1982,Nicaragua
148,"the union was not granted registration because it failed to meet the required conditions. The Committee, as well as the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, has noted that the legislation prevents the establishment of more than one trade union in the same enterprise if the workers so wish, contrary to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Nicaragua. The Committee therefore requests the Government to amend section  of the Labour Code on this point to allow the establishment of more than one union in an enterprise if the workers of such enterprise so wish.(c) Concerning the allegation of reprisals against workers of the Federation of Agricultural Workers of Chinandega for having affiliated to the opposition confederation (CUS), in view of the Government's statement that the Federation has not lodged a complaint and in view of the complainant's indications in its communication of  September  to the effect that it is not in a position to supply further information because of the fears of the members of the Federation, the Committee does not have sufficient information to pursue its examination of this aspect of the case.(d) Finally, concerning the allegation of harassment of the leaders of the SITRAVOCHI union affiliated to the CUS, and in particular to the disqualification of its General Secretary from driving, the Committee has taken note of the explanations provided by the Government and considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.",0,1982,Nicaragua
149,".The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In conformity with the invitation extended by the Government of Nicaragua in a communication dated  May , a study mission visited Nicaragua from  September to  October  (see the mission report annexed hereto).
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has had before it various complaints of violation of freedom of association and of the right to organise in Nicaragua which it has examined on a number of occasions. (See, in particular, the th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ).) In addition, three new complaints have been presented by the ICFTU in communications dated  March,  April,  and  May, and  July , by the WCL in a communication of  August (Case No. ) and by the IOE in communications dated  June and  and  July  (Case No. ).
.In a communication of  June , several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference lodged a complaint under article  of the Constitution of the ILO against the Government of Nicaragua for infringements of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.At its meeting in May , the Committee invited the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations (see th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June )):(a) The Committee reminds the Government that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights, and requests it to take the necessary measures to ensure that such protection is effectively provided.(b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the arrest and current situation of the trade unionists Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.(c) The Committee, while noting with interest that the rights suspended by the state of emergency have been restored, requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on the resumption of activities by employers' and workers' organisations in practice, particularly as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, exercise of the right of assembly, registration of these organisations and exercise of the right to strike.(d) Noting that Decree No.  is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of voluntary collective negotiation, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this situation and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt in this connection.(e) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.(f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.The above-mentioned study mission was carried out from  September to  October  by Professor Fernando Uribe Restrepo, a member of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, accompanied by Mr. Bernard Gernigon, Chief of the ILO Freedom of Association Branch, and Mr. Christian Ramos, an official of said Branch. The report of the representative of the Director-General appears as an annex to this document.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes first of all to express its thanks to Mr. Fernando Uribe Restrepo for having undertaken this study mission as the Director-General's representative and for his detailed report on the matters pending.
.Since the complaints and the information gathered during the mission are all analysed in the report of the Director-General's representative, the Committee can proceed directly to its conclusions on the various cases.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee notes the report of the study mission carried out in Nicaragua and the facilities granted by the authorities to the Director-General's representative for carrying out his mission. It deplores however the fact that the Director-General's representative was not authorised to meet one of the imprisoned persons with whom the mission had asked to speak.b) The Committee requests the Government to furnish a copy of the text of the judgement that will be handed down in the case of CUS trade unionists now held at the ""Zona franca"" penitentiary compound in Managua mentioned in paragraph  above.c) The Committee requests the Government to consider the adoption of amnesty or reduced sentence measures in respect of Mr. Milton Silva Gaitn and Mr. Arcadio Ortz Espinoza, two trade unionists who were sentenced to five and six years' imprisonment.d) The Committee requests the World Confederation of Labour to furnish further information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Mr. Anastasio Jimenez Maldonado, Mr. Justino Rivera, Mrs. Eva Gonzles and Mr. Eleazar Marenco.e) The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the arrest of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above (specific facts motivating the arrests, text of the judgements, place of detention).f) As regards the arrests carried out during a hunger strike organised by the Permanent Congress of Workers, the Committee reminds the Government that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no charge is made entails restrictions on freedom of association and that governments should take measures to ensure that the authorities receive appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of arrests being based on trade union activities.g) As regards the attacks carried out against trade union premises and the threats against trade unionists, the Committee recalls that activities of this kind create among trade unionists a climate of fear which is extremely prejudicial to the exercise of trade union activities and that the authorities, when informed of such matters, should carry out an immediate investigation to determine who is responsible and punish the guilty parties.h) As regards the measures taken following the demonstration in Nandaime, the Committee considers, in view of the political nature of this demonstration, that the matter should be examined by other international bodies which have general competence in respect of human rights.i) As regards the confiscation of property, the Committee considers that this measure appears to have been particularly biased against the COSEP leaders and members and it considers that all the provisions relating to compensation for expropriated land should be reviewed to ensure that there is real and fair compensation for the losses sustained by the landowners and that the Government should reopen the compensation files when so requested by persons who consider that they have been despoiled.j) As regards the conviction of Mr. Alegra, the Committee expresses its concern at the procedure followed in this case and at the extreme harshness of the sentence handed down by the court of first instance. The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Court of Appeal in Managua will re-examine the case with all the requisite attentiveness and impartiality. It requests the Government to furnish a copy of the decision reached by the Court of Appeal as soon as it is available.k) As regards civil liberties connected with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that unduly severe restrictions still remain and therefore requests the Government to take advantage of the peace process that has begun in Nicaragua to adopt legislation that will fully guarantee the exercise of public freedoms and broaden judicial safeguards.l) As regards tripartite consultations on international labour standards, the Committee requests the Government to set up and convene as soon as possible an advisory committee on this subject - which should be representative of all employers' and workers' organisations - and to furnish information on the",0,1982,Nicaragua
150,"setting up and meetings of this advisory committee.m) On the subject of trade union legislation, the Committee urges the Government to work with all the workers' and employers' organisations - and with the ILO as already accepted by the Government - on the drafting of the new Labour Code which it intends to prepare and it expresses the firm hope that the Government will be able to report very shortly substantial progress towards new legislation in line with Conventions Nos.  and .n) In view of the conclusions it has thus reached, the Committee observes that the situation of employers' and workers' organisations in Nicaragua gives rise to major problems in relation to several basic principles concerning freedom of association and trade union rights. The Committee accordingly considers that the Government should take concrete measures in the shortest possible time to apply fully the Conventions on freedom of association which it has ratified. These measures should cover all the problems which arise in law in relation to both the preparation of a new Labour Code and the adoption of legislation guaranteeing the full exercise of civil liberties. These legal measures should be accompanied by measures relating to factual situations, such as, in the first place, the release of leaders of employers' and workers' organisations at present in detention. Should the Government not supply, before the next meeting of the Committee in February , information demonstrating a change in attitude as regards these matters and a clear desire to make progress as regards the situation of employers' and workers' organisations, as well as their leaders and members, the Committee would consider it necessary to refer the matter to the Governing Body recommending to it the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry in conformity with article , paragraph , of the Constitution.
.The Committee had before it a number of complaints of infringements of freedom of association in Nicaragua presented by the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and a complaint concerning the observance by Nicaragua of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ) made by a number of Employers' delegates to the rd () Session of the International Labour Conference under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.In conformity with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ), the Committee submits, for the Governing Body's approval, a report on the pending cases and the complaint presented in virtue of article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been examining various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Two cases examined previously and presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) are still before the Committee.
.In addition, in a communication of  June , several Employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua.
.The cases still pending and the complaint under article  of the Constitution of the ILO were last examined by the Committee at its meeting in February . (See th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th (February-March ) Session.) ).
.Subsequently, the Government supplied its observations in a communication dated  April .
.This complaint, dated  June , was signed by Mr. Henri Georget, Employers' delegate, Niger, Mr. Johan von Holten, Employers' delegate, Sweden, Mr. Hiroshi Tsujino, Employers' delegate, Japan, Mr. Javier Ferrer Dufoll, Employers' delegate, Spain, Mr. Arthur Joao Donato, Employers' delegate, Brazil, Mr. Raoul Inocentes, Employers' delegate, Philippines, Mr. Wolf Dieter Lindner, Employers' delegate, Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Tom D. Owuor, Employers' delegate, Kenya, and Mr. Ray Brillinger, Employers' delegate, Canada. In separate communications, Mr. Roberto Favelevic, Employers' delegate, Argentina, and Mr. Vincente Bortoni, Employers' delegate, Mexico, associated themselves with the complaint.
.In their communication, the complainants recalled that since  at least  complaints had been lodged with the ILO by organisations of workers and employers concerning infringements by the Government of Nicaragua of its obligations under Convention No. . The infringements consisted of murder (Case No. ), physical aggression (Cases Nos. , , ,  and ), torture (Cases Nos.  and ), arbitrary arrests (Cases Nos. , , , , , , , , , , ,  and ), violation of domicile (Cases Nos.  and ), ransacking of offices (Cases Nos.  and ), confiscation of land (Case No. ), restrictions on freedom of movement (Cases Nos. , , ,  and ), violations of freedom of expression (Cases Nos. ,  and ) and a number of other questions involving non-recognition of organisations of self-employed workers until complaints could be presented to the ILO. Any occupational organisation of employers or workers which did not submit to the authority of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) was, according to the complainants, the subject of government repression either through its officials or through organised gangs. Consequently Nicaragua had been in a state of emergency for several years. This state of emergency had been continually extended, most recently by Decree No.  of  January . The complainants added that the state of emergency was used by the Government to suppress all rights and freedoms that were essential for the satisfactory implementation of Convention No.  and to suppress any opposition to the interests of the authorities. Moreover, a new Constitution had been promulgated in January  which implicitly denied employers the right of association, which they had enjoyed previously, while granting this right to many other categories; for the complainants, this was an obvious infringement of Article  and Article , paragraph , of Convention No. .
.The complainants further alleged that Decree No. , issued by the Government on  September  had, since its application, made collective agreements subject to approval by the Ministry of Labour for reasons of economic policy - which, in fact, made freedom to bargain collectively quite meaningless. The complainants considered that, although the competent bodies of the ILO had repeated that this was an infringement of Convention No. , the Government had done nothing to remedy the situation. In particular, wages could not be the subject of collective bargaining since they were determined by the National System of Labour and Wage Organisation (SNOTS) which classified every conceivable form of employment and fixed the corresponding remuneration. The complainants pointed out that this violation of Article  of the Convention was the subject of a recommendation by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The complainants stated, moreover, that the most representative organisation of employers in Nicaragua was the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP). This organisation was covered by Article  of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ). Nevertheless, according to the complainants, the Government had not consulted the COSEP on procedures which ensure effective consultations, in accordance with Article  of the instrument. Contrary to what it stated in its report on the application of the Convention, the Government had also neglected to consult the COSEP on matters covered by Article  of the Convention and consequently, the complainants maintained, the Government had respected none of its obligations under the Convention in so far as they related to consultations with the COSEP.
.In conclusion, the complainants requested that this complaint be examined and a report drawn up by a Commission of Inquiry, in accordance with article , paragraph , of the Constitution of the ILO, since, in particular, the Government was ignoring the recommendations of the Governing Body Committee on Freedom of Association and of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, both of which had already expressed their views on the questions referred to above.b. Decision of the Governing Body
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, at the proposal of its Officers, took the following decisions concerning the complaint in question:a) the Government of Nicaragua, as the Government against which the complaint was lodged, should be invited by the Director-General to communicate its observations on the complaint by  January  at the latest;b) at its th Session, the Governing Body would determine in the light of (i) the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association concerning those aspects of the complaint received that concerned freedom of association, (ii) information that might",-1,1982,Nicaragua
151,"be furnished by the Government of Nicaragua, and (iii) the recommendations of the Committee on Freedom of Association on cases still outstanding, whether the complaint as a whole should be referred to a Commission of Inquiry.c. The Government's reply.In its reply of  January , the Government stated that, although it was true that several complaints claiming infringement of freedom of association had been presented, it was also true that these matters were closed since the Government had shown that they had nothing to do with trade union affairs but rather involved offences punishable under common law.
.In its reply of  January , the Government stated that, although it was true that several complaints claiming infringement of freedom of association had been presented, it was also true that these matters were closed since the Government had shown that they had nothing to do with trade union affairs but rather involved offences punishable under common law.
.The Government stated that on  January , by Decree No. , it had re-established the state of emergency as a legal means to defend itself against the war waged by the United States against Nicaragua; enforcement of the state of emergency was thus designed to forestall counter-revolutionary activities, thereby preserving the rights of Nicaraguan citizens. According to the Government, the statement that Decree No.  suspended several trade union rights was totally wrong since none of the rights suspended was of a strictly trade union nature. The only suspended right involving labour matters was the right to strike, which was not a trade union right but a right of workers whether or not they belonged to a union.
.The Government added that the establishment of the state of emergency was in line with the provisions of article  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article  of the American Convention of Human Rights.
.According to the Government, the state of emergency had in no way prevented the development of the trade union movement or the freedom of workers to join occupational organisations. Between  and , workers in both towns and the countryside had set up a total of , unions.
.The Government considered it important to recall that the ruling handed down by the International Court of Justice on  June  gave fundamental legal support to the Government and to its right to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity and economic and political independence through the international legal order. According to the Government, it was the policy of aggression against Nicaragua and not the state of emergency which was the cause of the difficult and exceptional circumstances being experienced by Nicaraguan society as a whole. The Government emphasised that it hoped to suspend the state of emergency when the causes which were behind its introduction no longer obtained.
.The Government went on to state that the fact that the right of employers to organise was not embodied in the Constitution should not be understood as a prohibition, since article  of the political Constitution set forth the general principle of the right to organise of all persons in order to defend their interests. Moreover, the employers' right to organise was established in the Labour Code and in the regulations governing occupational associations.
.With respect to Decree No.  of , the Government considered that the provisions in question in no way constituted an infringement of the right of employers' and workers' organisations to negotiate collective agreements and, in accordance with the ILO's principle of tripartism, provision was made for the intervention of the Ministry of Labour. Conditions of employment were negotiated by means of a conciliation procedure. If the latter failed the Ministry of Labour could not impose the terms of a collective agreement on the parties. The matter had to be resolved, during a state of emergency, by an arbitration tribunal which came under the judicial authorities and, in normal times, by the procedure relating to the right to strike.
.According to the Government, the national system for organising labour and wages enabled employers and workers to take part in discussing the bases of the content of work in order to determine wages according to criteria of quantity and complexity.
.Lastly, the Government considered that Convention No.  had not been infringed since consultations had taken place with the organisations which the Government, in its sovereignty, had considered to be the most representative. However, it had no objection to consulting the COSEP as well in due course.
.In its communication of  January  the Government supplied the text of a communiqu stating that as from  January the state of emergency was suspended throughout the territory. The Government also stated in this communiqu that it intended to apply the Amnesty Act No.  when a ceasefire took place and the groups which had taken up arms returned to civilian life. If no such ceasefire took place, the Government would release the persons concerned if the Government of the United States or a central American Government decided to accept them. They would be authorised to return to Nicaragua at the end of the war.
.In a subsequent communication dated  January  the Government supplied the text of Decrees No.  which abolished the anti-Somoza People's courts and No.  which lifted the state of emergency for the whole country and restored the rights and guarantees laid down in the Nicaraguan Constitution.d) Examination of the complaint by the Committee at its meeting in February 
.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalled that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it had adopted conclusions which were approved by the Governing Body and which contained precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases were in a number of instances in contradiction with the allegations made by the authors of the complaints. The Committee was therefore not in a position to draw conclusions from all these cases on the general situation prevailing in Nicaragua with respect to freedom of association.
.As regards the allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No. , the Committee noted that the Committee of Experts had considered whether the wage-fixing system was in conformity with Article  of the Convention.
.Finally, as regards the application of Convention No. , the Committee recalled that it had indicated that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organisations should exist in the legislation and that such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments.
.The Committee noted that the Government had stated that the only labour right suspended by the state of emergency was the right to strike. As regards the employers' right to organise, the Government had pointed out that this right was recognised by the Labour Code and the regulations governing occupational associations and stated that it was willing to consult the COSEP, in due course, on matters concerning international labour standards.
.Furthermore, in a more recent communication the Government announced the suspension of the state of emergency and its willingness, subject to certain conditions, to apply the Amnesty Act. The Committee, while noting this favourable development, observed that there was a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concerned the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and also a number of factual questions.
.Moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations was to examine, at its session in March , the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and  on the basis of the information supplied by the Government at the last session of the Conference to the Committee on the Application of Standards, and of the latest developments that had taken place in the country.
.The Committee considered that the Government's reply for its next session in May, together with the comments of the Committee of Experts, were elements that should be taken into consideration in determining the action to be taken on the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution.
.In the light of these conclusions the Committee requested the Government to supply detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency as regards the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the situation concerning the possible application of the Amnesty Act. The Committee also decided that it would examine at its meeting in May  the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry in response to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, on the basis of the information which would be supplied by the Government and the comments which would be formulated by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations on the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and .e. The Government's subsequent reply
.In its communication dated  April , the Government states",0,1982,Nicaragua
152,"once again that, by Decree No.  of  January , it lifted the national state of emergency which had been proclaimed in accordance with article  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article  of the American Convention of Human Rights. The Government affirms that lifting the state of emergency was an act of good will on its side, aimed at facilitating the effective implementation of the agreements concluded by the Presidents of Central America on  August  with a view to establishing peace and restoring normal conditions in the region, and in Nicaragua in particular.
.The Government reaffirms that the Decree proclaiming the state of emergency had only temporarily suspended the exercise of one labour-related right: the right to strike recognised in article  of the Constitution. As an Act of the Republic, the suspension Decree applied to the entire population, including employers, workers and their organisations. Thus, suspension of the exercise of certain civil and political liberties could have affected the normal development of activities of these organisations and their members who, as residents in Nicaragua, are obliged to respect the legislation in force.
.The Government states that with the lifting of the national state of emergency the full exercise of the rights and guarantees contained in the political Constitution of Nicaragua has been restored.
.After recalling those provisions of the Constitution which had been suspended and which are now in force again, the Government affirms that restoring these rights has incontestably had a positive effect on all population groups, including workers and employers and their organisations.
.The Government adds that a partial amnesty was declared by the National Assembly on  March , and affected  persons convicted of crimes against public order and security, who are members of the Nicaraguan resistance movement. The Government and the leadership of the Nicaraguan resistance movement are currently discussing a general amnesty, in addition to social issues.
.The workers' organisations' allegations still pending concern the ransacking of trade union premises and the arrest of trade unionists.
.As regards the first point, the Committee observes that, according to the Government, it was because of internal dissension within the Central of Nicaraguan Workers (CTN) and at the request of one of the parties that the police intervened in order to protect persons and property. While noting these explanations, the Committee must recall the importance which it attaches to the protection of trade union property, which was also emphasised by the International Labour Conference in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted in , where it had pointed out that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. The Committee would also draw the Government's attention to the fact that, even if police intervention in trade union premises may be justified in particularly serious circumstances, such intervention should in no case entail the ransacking of premises and archives of an organisation.
.As regards the arrest of trade unionists, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, according to which there is no trace of two of these persons ever having been arrested, and that a third was released after having completed the prison term to which he had been sentenced for causing bodily harm. The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the situation of two persons concerning whom it has not yet replied, Mr. Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.
.As regards the complaint lodged by several Employers' delegates under article  of the Constitution, the Committee recalls that this complaint contains allegations concerning non-observance of Convention No. , based in particular on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional liberties, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise, non-observance of Convention No. , based on the absence of free collective bargaining, and non-observance of Convention No. , based on the absence of consultations with COSEP by the Government.
.In its reply, the Government refers to the lifting of the national state of emergency. The Committee notes with interest that all of the constitutional rights which had been suspended have thus been restored, in particular in areas relating to the activities of employers' and workers' organisations. The Committee also notes that a partial amnesty has been declared for persons convicted of crimes against public order and security, and that negotiations are under way with a view to declaring a general amnesty.
.The Committee observes, however, that the Government has confined itself to supplying general information on the restoration of the rights which had been suspended, without supplying specific information on the resumption of the activities of employers' and workers' organisations in practice. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on this point, in particular as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, the exercise of employers' and workers' organisations' right to assemble, the registration of such organisations and the exercise of the right to strike.
.As regards the allegations relating to the application of Convention No. , the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts emphasised in its report, adopted at its March  Session, that Decree No.  referred to in the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, has been in force for more than seven years and that it makes collective agreements subject to the approval of the Ministry of Labour for reasons of economic policy, so that employers' and workers' organisations are not able to fix wages freely. Like the Committee of Experts, the Committee considers that this situation is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of machinery for voluntary collective negotiation. It therefore requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this infringement of the Convention and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt for this purpose.
.As regards the application of Convention No. , the Government does not supply any new information on consultation of COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards, although it stated in its reply submitted to the Committee's February  meeting that it was willing to consult it in due course. The Committee therefore requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or which it intends to undertake with COSEP.
.In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Committee must note that the Government has not supplied all the necessary information to enable it to reach a decision in full knowledge of all the facts concerning the situation of employers' and workers' organisations in Nicaragua.
.In the light of the information before it, the Committee examined what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO. First, the Committee considered the possibility of adjourning the adoption of its recommendation to the Governing Body until its meeting in November . Secondly, the Committee examined the possibility of recommending to the Governing Body at its present session the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry. Thirdly, the Committee considered the possibility of recommending the Governing Body to ask the Government to invite a study mission entrusted to examine on the spot the factual and legal questions pending before the Committee since . Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question put at the beginning of this paragraph.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee reminds the Government that the right to adequate protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the exercise of trade union rights, and requests it to take the necessary measures to ensure that such protection is effectively provided.b) The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the arrest and current situation of the trade unionists Eric Gonzlez and Eugenio Membreo.c) The Committee, while noting with interest that the rights suspended by the state of emergency have been restored, requests the Government to supply specific and detailed information on the resumption of activities by employers' and workers' organisations in practice, particularly as regards the dissemination of trade union and occupational information, exercise of the right of assembly, registration of these organisations and exercise of the right to strike.d) Noting that Decree No.  is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  respecting the promotion and development of voluntary collective negotiation, the Committee requests the Government to take the necessary measures to correct this situation and to supply information on the measures which it intends to adopt in this connection.e) The Committee",-1,1982,Nicaragua
153,"requests the Government to supply information on any consultations which it has undertaken or intends to undertake with COSEP on matters relating to international labour standards.f) Having received after its discussions a letter from the Government dated  May  which proposes the setting up of a study mission, along the lines which the Committee itself had envisaged, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to agree to this proposal. The Committee will thus be in a position at its November  meeting to give a final reply to the question of what effect should be given to the complaint lodged under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.For several years now, the Committee on Freedom of Association has been seized of various complaints of violation of the right of association and of freedom of association in Nicaragua. Five cases are currently before the Committee, of which two (Nos.  and ) are presented by international organisations of workers (CLAT, WCL and ICFTU) and three (Nos. ,  and ) by the International Organisation of Employers.
.Cases Nos.  and  were last examined by the Committee at its November  meeting and Cases Nos.  and  in February . (See respectively th Report, paras.  to , and th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th and th Sessions (November  and February-March ).) In the absence of a reply from the Government, the Committee has not yet examined Case No. .
.Subsequently, the Government supplied observations in communications dated  May  (for Case No. ),  August  (for Cases Nos. , ,  and ),  January  (for Cases Nos.  and ) and  February  (for Cases Nos. ,  and ).
.In addition, in a communication of  June , several employers' delegates to the rd Session () of the International Labour Conference presented a complaint against the Government of Nicaragua, under article  of the Constitution of the ILO, for violations of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), all three ratified by Nicaragua. The Government furnished its observations on this complaint in a communication of ,  and  January .
.The cases presented to the Committee by workers' organisations relate to the sentencing and arrest of trade unionists, some of whom were tortured, to threats made to trade unionists and their families, to searches of the headquarters of a trade union confederation and to the suspension of a trade union review.
.As regards the sentencing of trade unionists, the Government has furnished the text of a ruling handed down by an anti-Somoza people's court of appeal in respect of a number of persons who were listed as trade unionists in the complainants' communications. According to the text of the ruling, the persons concerned were allegedly sentenced for belonging to an organisation of a subversive nature, for clandestine travel abroad and for carrying out military and economic intelligence missions. The ruling makes no reference whatsoever to membership of a trade union organisation or to activities that might be considered to be of a trade union nature.
.The Committee notes that the Government has still not replied to a number of allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists Eduardo Aburto, Eric Gonzlez, Carlos Herrera, Sergio Rosa and Eugenio Membreo.
.As regards the torture or threats alleged to have been carried out against trade unionists or their families, the Committee notes that the Government completely rejects these allegations, stating that although there may have been some exceptional cases, they were the subject of investigations and penalties. Noting the discrepancies between the complainants' allegations and the Government's reply on this point, the Committee is obliged to recall that governments should give the necessary instructions to ensure that no detained person is subjected to ill-treatment and to provide for effective punishment in cases where there is evidence of ill-treatment.
.As regards the search of the premises of the Central of Nigaraguan Workers, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this measure was motivated by internal dissension within the organisation. The Government does not, however, indicate whether this search was carried out with a warrant. The Committee therefore requests the Government to indicate whether this was the case. The Committee recalls that trade union premises should not be searched unless a warrant has been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority. (See, for example, th Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. .) In addition, the Committee considers that even if a warrant had been obtained from the ordinary judicial authority for a search, this in no way justified the ransacking of the CTN premises which the complainants described.
.The Committee takes note of the reasons which formed the basis of the suspension of the review of the CUS, namely the non-fulfilment of certain legal formalities required by the General Act of Communications Media. It also notes that this review has been authorised to circulate again. The Committee must, however, recall that the right to express opinions without previous authorisation through the press is one of the essential elements of the rights of occupational organisations.
.The complaints lodged with the Committee by the IOE relate to a campaign against the leaders of the Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP) and in particular to the confiscation of assets, land and enterprises belonging to them and the expulsion of one of them from the country; the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day in September , the re-establishment of the state of emergency suspending for one year certain constitutional liberties, and the closure for an indefinite period of the newspaper La Prensa, which was used by the COSEP to disseminate information of concern to employers.
.As regards the expropriation of land and assets of the leaders of the COSEP, the Committee notes the Government's explanation that most of these measures corresponded to the needs of agrarian reform. While realising that the persons mentioned in the IOE's complaint cannot take advantage of their position as COSEP leaders to evade the consequences of an agrarian reform policy, the Committee must nevertheless point out with concern that these measures have allegedly affected a large number of leaders of the employers' organisation in a discriminatory fashion. It expresses the hope that the persons in question will be fairly compensated for their losses as provided for by law.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that there is no trace of any expulsion order against Mr. Frank Bendaa, the Vice-President of COSEP. Given the contradiction between the complainants' version of the facts and that of the Government, the Committee can only recall generally, that the expulsion of leaders of employers' or workers' organisations from their country for having been involved in activities linked to their position, is not only contrary to human rights, but also interferes in the activities of the organisations to which they belong (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada) para. ).
.The Government has not made a specific reply to the requests for information concerning the house arrest of the President of the COSEP during Private Enterprise Day. It confines itself to stating that no citizen was deprived of his liberty on that occasion. The Committee notes this information but regrets that the authorities banned the celebrating of this Private Enterprise Day.
.The Committee notes that the newspaper La Prensa is once again circulating freely and expresses the hope that this measure will be final. It would, indeed, recall that the right of an employers' or workers' organisation to express its opinions uncensored through the independent press should in no way differ from the right to express opinions in exclusively occupational or trade union journals (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Grenada), para. ).
.Lastly, as concerns the suspension of the state of emergency, the Committee refers to the considerations set out hereafter concerning the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.
.The Governing Body must consider, in the present case, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry under article  of the Constitution. This complaint contains allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No.  based mainly on the  complaints examined by the Committee, suspension of certain constitutional freedoms, non-recognition in the national Constitution of the employers' right to organise; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the absence of free collective bargaining; and on the non-observance of Convention No.  based on the Government's failure to consult the COSEP.
.As regards the allegations relating to violations of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that on each of the cases cited by the complainants it has adopted conclusions which were approved by the Governing Body, and which contain precise recommendations addressed to the Government. The facts in the replies supplied by the Government during the examination of these cases are in a number",0,1982,Nicaragua
154,"of instances in contradiction with the allegations made by the authors of the complaints. The Committee is therefore not in a position at the moment to draw conclusions from the basis of all these cases on the general situation prevailing in Nicaragua in the freedom of association field.
.As regards the allegations concerning the non-observance of Convention No. , the Committee notes that the Committee of Experts has considered whether the wage fixing system is in conformity with Article  of the Convention.
.Finally, as regards the application of Convention No. , the Committee recalls that it has indicated that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organisations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments.
.The Committee notes that the Government has stated that the only labour right suspended by the state of emergency is the right to strike. As regards the employers' right to organise, the Government points out that this right is recognised by the Labour Code and the regulations governing occupational associations and states that it is willing to consult the COSEP, in due course, on matters concerning international labour standards.
.Furthermore, in a more recent communication, the Government announces the suspension of the state of emergency and its willingness, subject to certain conditions, to apply the Amnesty Act. The Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency for the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the possible application of the Amnesty Act. The Committee, while noting this favourable development, observes, however, that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.
.Moreover, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations is to examine, at its next session in March , the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and  on the basis of the information supplied by the Government at the last session of the Conference to the Committee on the Application of Standards, and of the latest developments that have taken place in the country.
.The Committee considers that the Government's reply for its next session in May, together with the comments of the Committee of Experts, are elements that should be taken into consideration in determining the action to be taken on the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution. The Committee therefore decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May , on the basis of this information, the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry.
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest of trade unionists, to which it has still not replied.b) The Committee urges the Government to ensure that instructions are given so that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment and that provision is made for effective punishment where there is evidence of such treatment.c) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that searches of trade union premises are carried out only on orders from an ordinary court. It requests the Government to indicate whether a warrant was in fact issued for the search of the CTN premises.d) The Committee, while noting that the expropriation of land and assets belonging to the leaders of the COSEP is, according to the Government, part of an agrarian reform, notes with concern that these measures have allegedly affected in a discriminatory way a large number of COSEP leaders. It expresses the hope that the persons concerned will be fairly compensated for their losses in accordance with the law.e) The Committee once again deplores the fact that the authorities banned celebration of Private Enterprise Day, organised by the COSEP.f) The Committee notes that the trade union review of the CUS and the newspaper La Prensa can again be published and circulated and expresses the hope that these measures will be final. It would indeed draw the Government's attention to the principle that the right to express opinions through the press without previous authorisation is one of the essential elements of the rights of workers' and employers' organisations.g) The Committee notes that the Government has announced the lifting of the state of emergency. It requests the Government to supply detailed information on the consequences of the suspension of the state of emergency as regards the activities of employers' and workers' organisations and on developments in the situation concerning the possible application of the Amnesty Act. However, the Committee observes that there is a major contradiction between the allegations made in the complaint and the replies of the Government concerning the areas covered by Conventions Nos. ,  and . These contradictions concern the conformity of certain texts with the instruments mentioned and concern factual questions.h) The Committee decides that it will examine at its next meeting in May  the advisability of setting up a Commission of Inquiry in response to the complaint lodged under article  of the Constitution, on the basis of the information which will be supplied by the Government and the comments which will be formulated by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the application by Nicaragua of Conventions Nos.  and . Geneva,  February . Roberto Ago, Chairman.
.The Committee examined Cases Nos.  (presented by the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour) and  (presented by International Organisation of Employers) at its November  meeting (see th Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November )). The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings of November , February  and November . (See th Report, paras.  to ; rd Report, paras.  to  and ; and st Report, paras.  to , of November , February-March , and November , respectively.)
.Subsequently, the Government sent certain observations in communications dated  and  January . The International Organisation of Employers sent additional information concerning Case No.  in a communication of  January .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that according to the pertinent legislation, the anti-Somoza people's courts are special or extraordinary tribunals which handle summary proceedings entailing a number of significant restrictions on the rights of defendants. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that according to the legislation involved, the crimes over which the anti-Somoza people's courts have jurisdiction, in principle, have no bearing on the exercise of trade union rights or activities. Noting however the contradiction on this point between the complainant and the Government, the Committee again asks the Government to supply copies of the judgements of these courts concerning the persons mentioned by the complainants. The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the allegations made in Case No. .
.As regards the declaration of the state of emergency contained in Decree No.  of  January , the Committee takes note of the important motives invoked by the Government, and of the restrictions which that situation implies in the exercise of certain fundamental public freedoms and trade union rights, as noted by one of the complainant organisations. In this respect, the Committee notes that the restrictions previously examined in Cases Nos.  and , contrary to the Government's letter of  January , are not limited to counter-revolutionary activities. The Committee has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency (see, for example, st Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ), while recommending that in the event of states of siege or emergency, as regards its relations with employers' and workers' organisations and their representatives, the Government should as far as possible rely on measures provided for in ordinary law rather than on emergency measures which are liable, by their very nature, to involve certain restrictions on fundamental rights (see, for example, th Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. ).
.For its part, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has emphasised that the freedom of association Conventions do not contain any provision permitting derogation from the obligations arising under the Convention, or any suspension of their application, based on a plea that an emergency exists (see General Survey, Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, Report III, Part IV(B), International Labour Conference, th Session, , para. ). Given that the state of emergency has continued over a period of several years, entailing serious restrictions on trade union rights and public freedoms that are essential for the exercise of such rights,",-1,1982,Nicaragua
155,"the Committee again expresses the firm hope that the state of emergency will be lifted in the near future. Although it recognises the existence of extremely grave circumstances in Nicaragua, the Committee considers that a return to normality in trade union life would be facilitated, in any case, by limiting the application of the state of emergency to certain geographical areas. At least, it is necessary to safeguard the exercise of specifically trade union rights such as the establishment of employers' and workers' organisations, the right to hold trade union meetings in trade union premises, and the right to strike in non-essential services.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations on the allegation pending in connection with Case No. .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee requests the Government to lift the state of emergency in the near future. In the meantime, it requests the Government to limit its application to certain geographical areas. In any case, it is necessary to safeguard the exercise of specifically trade union rights such as the right to organise, the right to meet on trade union premises, and the right to strike in non-essential services.b) With a view to this, it requests the Government, in its relations with employers' and workers' organisations, to rely on measures provided for in ordinary law rather than on emergency measures.c) It requests the Government to send its observations and supply the information requested by the Committee during its previous examination of these cases as regards issues still pending, in particular copies of the judgements of the anti-Somoza people's courts concerning the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants.
.The Committee last examined cases ,  and  at its November  meeting (see st Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November )).
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  (presented by the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour) at its November  and February  meetings. (See th Report, paras.  to , and rd Report, paras.  to  and , approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions in November  and February-March , respectively.) The World Confederation of Labour sent new allegations in a communication dated  November .
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labour) has already been examined by the Committee on four occasions: March , March and June  and March . (See nd, rd, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body.)
.Case No.  (presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) was examined in February-March  and was the subject of an interim report approved by the Governing Body. (th Report, paras.  to .) At a later date, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) submitted new allegations in communications dated  and  January and  and  March .
.The complaints concerning Cases Nos.  and  appear in communications from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) of  July (Case No. ) and  October  (Case No. ). With regard to the first case, the E sent additional information in a communication dated  August .
.The Government replied in communications dated  and  November ,  January,  February,  and  May and  October .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No.) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) In the first place, the Committee expresses its concern at the gravity of the allegations made by employers' and workers' organisations concerning, in particular, the detention and sentencing of trade unionists and the interference by the authorities in the activities of the occupational organisations.(b) As regards Case No.  the Committee urges the Government to transmit information on certain aspects of the case, as well as the judgements handed down or which will be handed down by the People's anti-Somoza tribunals, concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  above. Noting that the People's anti-Somoza tribunals have been created specially by an emergency decree in April  the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with political or . common law crimes which the Government considers are unrelated to trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried promptly by independent and impartial judicial body. The Committee also requests the Government to transmit the text of the law instituting the People's anti-Somoza tribunals.(c) With respect to Case No. , the Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union officials and trade unionists of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(d) As regards Case No. , the Committee regrets that, in spite of several requests, the Government has not specifically referred to the allegations of one of the complainants which, on the basis of evidence, accused public officials of having been involved in these incidents and the police of having done nothing to prevent the aggression against the members of the CUS and the destruction of its offices. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that the public authorities are bound, in accordance with Convention No. , to refrain from any interference in the activities and internal workings of trade unions.(e) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the developments of the trial under way against five trade unionists for having stolen cattle, and asks it to send observations on the trade unions to which it failed to refer and which, according to the ICFTU, were arrested (Eduardo Gutirrez, Juan Gaitn and Enrique Flores). The Committee also requests the Government to reply to the allegation that the children, wives and mothers of the detained trade unionists were threatened with imprisonment if their husbands or children did not give up their CUS membership and that they are constantly visited by police who threaten them and help themselves to toiletries and foodstuffs.(f) Finally, the Committee deplores that the Government has not replied to the allegations contained in one of the complainants' communications dated  and  January  (banning of the CUS trade union review; the fact that CUS trade unionists are summoned to appear by the State Security Police Force, and are subjected to pressure and threatened; visits of a delegation of officials to organisations belonging to the CUS in the northern, southern and western areas of the country and warnings to the members that if there were any meetings in the future, those involved would go to prison and that this ban also extended to the setting up of new trade union organisations). The Committee requests the Government to furnish information on these aspects of the case.(g) As regards Case No. , the Committee notes that the Government has sent certain information on only one of the numerous allegations. Since the object of all the allegations in this case is to show a discriminatory attitude by the Government against COSEP, the Committee postpones the examination of the case and requests the Government to provide a reply urgently on those aspects of the case to which it has not referred.(h) As regards Case no. , the Committee regrets that the authorities prohibited the holding of the ""Private Enterprise Day"" on  November , organised by COSEP, and expresses the hope that in future this employers' organisation will be able to determine without any interference the date and activities of the Private Enterprise Day.(i) The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that the right of occupational organisations to hold meetings in their premises without advance authorisation and without interference by the authorities is a fundamental aspect of freedom of association.(j) The Committee also notes that according to the Government, on  and  September  no one was arrested for matters related directly with the allegations. The Committee requests the Government to indicate specifically whether the president of COSEP was placed under house arrest on  September  (""Private Enterprise Day""), as alleged by the complainant and, if so, the reasons.(k) The Committee observes that Decrees Nos.  and  proclaiming a state of national emergency with the subsequent restrictions on civil and trade union freedoms should have expired at the end of October . The Committee expresses the firm hope that these restrictions will not be re- imposed and requests the Government to furnish information on the subject.
.The Committee examined Case No.  on two occasions, at its November",0,1982,Nicaragua
156,"l and February l meetings, when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body. (See lth Report, paras. -, and rd Report, paras. - and , approved by the Governing Body at its st and th Sessions in November l and February-March l respectively.) The World Confederation of Labour sent additional information in support of its complaint on  April l.
.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee on four occasions: in March l, March and June l and March l. (See nd, rd, th and th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body.)
.Case No.  was examined in the Committee's rd Report (see paras. - and ) approved by the Governing Body at its February-March l session. The Committee also noted certain information communicated by the Government in January l (See th Report, para. , approved by the Governing Body in February-March l).
.Case No.  was examined in February-March l and was the subject of an interim report approved by the Governing Body. (th Report, paras. -.)
.The Government supplied certain information on these cases in communications of January, May and  October l.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, l (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, l (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions: Generally speaking, the Committee observes that, during its session in May l, the Government supplied detailed replies on certain aspects of the present cases, but regrets that it has not replied to all the allegations. The Committee also deplores that the latest information supplied by the Government concerning the detention of trade unionists was only received by the Committee during its present meeting.a) In Case No.  the Committee notes that Mr. Mora has been pardoned and that Mr. Snchez has been sentenced for activities unconnected with freedom of association.b) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied regarding the imprisonment of three trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, the names of which are annexed to the present report, and on the refusal to register the executive committees of the agricultural unions of Ftima and Las Mojarras in El Jicaral (department of Len) and of La Concepcin in Matagalpa, and of the unions of service station workers in Chinandega and Managua.c) In Case No.  the Committee notes that of the  trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, six have been released and three have received prison sentences. It requests the Government to supply copies of the judgements handed down against these three persons and to indicate whether the nine other trade unionists cited in the Annex are still in prison and, if so, to state the reasons for their detention.d) In Case No.  the Committee considers that, bearing in mind the allegations that trade union officials have been subjected to reprisals and violence for having belonged to a union affiliated to the CTN, it must recall the importance which it attaches to the exercise of trade union activities in full freedom. It therefore urges the Government to make efforts to guarantee a climate favourable to the peaceful development of the different tendencies of the trade union movement in Nicaragua.e) In Case No.  the Committee notes with regret that the Government has not replied to the allegations still pending.f) The Committee repeats its earlier request for an explanation of the occupation of the CUS headquarters on  August , led by two persons alleged to have links with the State Security forces, as evidenced by the statement made by the former legal adviser to the CUS.g) The Committee again requests the Government to reply to the allegation that, during the second occupation of the CUS headquarters on  August l, the police did nothing to stop the attack and intervened only when everything was over, although they were in the vicinity of the organisation's headquarters.h) The Committee again requests the Government to indicate whether Jos Agustn Tllez, Secretary-General of the Federation of Peasant Workers in Carazo, is in prison and if so, to indicate the grounds for his detention.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following recommendations:
.General recommendations(a) The Committee appreciates the spirit of co-operation that the Government has demonstrated by accepting that the Director-General's representative, during the direct contacts mission, could examine with the authorities the various aspects of the cases which were still pending and seek further information on them. The Committee observes that, thanks to the information obtained by the Director-General's representative, it has been able to examine a substantial number of the allegations to which the Government had not replied. However, the Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied detailed information on certain outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the statement made by the Deputy Minister concerning the content of the complaints the Committee recalls that even if, in certain instances, the allegations have lacked some precision, it is required to examine them in all objectivity and to seek to obtain a maximum of information concerning them.(c) The Committee wishes to express its serious concern at the large number of leaders and members of workers' and employers' organisations who have been arrested. The Committee considers that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights and in particular, the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, are fully respected and guaranteed.(d) The Committee observes from its examination of certain allegations and of the information supplied by the Government and from the mission report that acts of hostility between union organisations or within individual organisations occur rather frequently. The Committee considers that freedom of association implies the right of workers' and employers' organisations to resolve any difficulties by themselves, and without interference by the authorities; the Committee also considers that it is for the Government to create an atmosphere conducive to the resolution of such difficulties.
.Recommendations as to individual casesCase No. (a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied the text of the judgment handed down by the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of employer leader Salazar Argello which was handed down some time ago; it urges the Government to transmit this judgment at an early date.(b) The Committee notes with interest that the public prosecutor aid not bring any penal charges against certain employer leaders for offences against the security of the State and other offences. The Committee would recall that the preventive detention of leaders of workers' or employers' organisations for activities connected with the exercise of their rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) As regards the composition of the Council of State, the Committee considers that participation of workers' and employers' organisations in the Council should imply the strict application of criteria on the basis of which the representativity of these organisations may be determined; moreover, the participation of these organisations in the Council should not deprive other organisations of their right to defend the interests of their members.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take up the suggestion of the Director-General's representative that the Ministry responsible for agrarian reform should obtain further information and be informed of the allegations that members of the CTN have been physically attacked by the authorities on state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations and that sugar workers affiliated to the CTN have been prevented from entering their work centres; the Committee also requests the complainant to transmit any further information it may have concerning this matter.(b) The Committee requests the Government to call for an investigation of the alleged threats by official militias against the lives of trade union leaders (specifically, Luis Mora and Salvador Snchez) and to keep it informed of its findings.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has been recommending trade union organisations to join the Sandinista Central of Workers (CST) and that copies of the by-laws of trade union organisations, on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead, have been deposited at the headquarters of the CST so that it can register the recently constituted organisations among its members.(b) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that SEEOMC leader Alejandro Arnuero, who was to take part in a congress of the International Transport Workers' Federation in Brazil, had his passport withdrawn without any valid reason. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the final decision handed down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgment handed down on the granting of legal personality to the trade union of workers",0,1982,Nicaragua
157,"in various undertakings in the sugar sector (""Faustino Martinez"" and others) so that it can reach conclusions on the allegations with all relevant information at its disposal.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the searching of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the use of aggression against its leaders.(f) The Committee regrets that the Government has not indicated the precise grounds for the arrest of a number of trade unionists who have now been released but merely gives the name o the Act that they are said to have contravened; it again requests the Government to transmit information on this matter.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the information passed on by the CTN to the Director-General's representative concerning seven trade unionists who, contrary to the claims of the Government, are allegedly still in custody.The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations concerning arrests to which it has not replied, involving  union leaders or members.(h) In general terms, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures designed to deprive persons of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(i) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations that rural workers of WASACA affiliated to the CTN have been interrogated and threatened with imprisonment and that Eugenio Membreo and other members of the CTN executive committee have been threatened and intimidated in their homes. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(j) The Committee considers that no further examination need be made of the allegations relating to the coercion of Denis Maltes; the persecution and harassment of Zacaras Hernndez and Isabel Somarriba; the interference in the SEEOMC meeting on  December ; the detention of  trade union leaders and members of SEEOMC; and the physical attacks and threats against leaders of the CUS due to the SEEOMC meeting called for  May .Case No. (a) The Committee notes with interest that the General Labour Inspectorate has ordered the reinstatement of eight trade unionists employed by ENABUS who, according to the complainants, were dismissed for being members of an organisation affiliated to the CTN.(b) The Committee requests the complainants to send further details regarding the alleged destruction of the premises of the rural workers' union in Rio Grande and Las Mojarras (Department of Len) and to indicate exactly in which locality the five leaders of the Union of Workers of the Hacienda El Progreso were dismissed on  January  and prevented from returning to work despite a court order to reinstate them (according to the Government, there are over a hundred plantations under the name of ""El Progreso"").(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied, involving the union leader Hermgenes Aguirre Largaespada and trade unionist Larry Lee Shoures and the arrest of trade unionist Abelino Gonzlez, Piz.Case No. (a) Since there is no record of any charges having been brought against the persons concerned, the Committee regrets that four union leaders should have been held in custody for a long time and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the preventive detention of union leaders entails a serious risk of interference in the activities of trade union organisations.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Salomn Daz Fernndez is being held for counter-revolutionary activities and requests the Government to indicate whether he is still in custody and to specify the precise charges brought against him.
.The complaints are contained in communications of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), dated respectively  and  April . CLAT sent further information in a communication of  May . The Government replied in a communication of  July .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that in the context of a systematic campaign by the Government to destroy the Central of Nicaraguan Workers (CTN) the following has occurred:- physical attacks by the authorities on members of the CTN working on the State controlled banana estates and sugar plantations;- death threats by the official militia against CTN trade union leaders. The complainants state that Luis Mora, President of the Press Workers Union, and Salvador Snchez were allegedly threatened in this way when they were under detention and that the police attempted to make Salvador Snchez sign a statement against the CTN;- prison sentences against Juan Suazo, a leader of the Aceites Corona Union, accused of disrespect to a member of the Junta of National Reconstruction by refusing to shake hands with him on the occasion of a visit by the latter to a work centre, and against Luis Mora, President of the Press Workers' Union, sentenced for being a trade union leader;- detention of trade unionists because of their being trade unionists. The persons concerned are Roger Alonso, a reporter, arrested on  April  and whose whereabouts are unknown, and also Benito Caldern, Martin Torres, Ins Segueira, Luis Avenor, Jos Eriteo, Arsenio Cruz and Asuncin Segueira, detained solely because they were members of the CTN and subsequently released without it having been possible to prove that they had committed any offence;- the members of the Executive Committee of the CTN have been forbidden to leave the country;- restrictions on the freedom of movement of leaders and members of the CTN within the country;- preventing the entry to their work centres of sugar workers belonging to the CTN;- systematic defamatory attacks against the CTN and its leaders in the official media without permission to exercise the right of reply;- attacks on the CTN premises in front of which crowds gather, including members of the militia and the Sandinista army, who daub the walls with paint and threaten the lives of CTN officials without the authorities seeking to intervene.
.Finally, according to the complainants, the lives and safety of Messrs Huembes, Altamirano and Castillo, senior officials of the CTN, are alleged to be in imminent danger.
.In its communication of  July , the Government states that Juan Suazo was sentenced to  days' imprisonment for disrespect to authority, Luis Mora to one year's imprisonment for embezzlement of the assets of the Plsticos Record Factory, and Benito Caldern to  months for cattle stealing. The Government adds that Salvador Snchez, who had been detained in  and charged with theft, was acquitted by the courts and released on  July ; that Martin Torres, who had been accused of sabotage, was freed on  July , and Roger Alonso on  April :. As for Ins Segueira, Luis Avenor, Jos Eriteo, Arsenio Cruz and Asuncin Segueura, the Government states that they do not appear in the records of detained persons.
.The Government denies, moreover, that there are restrictions on the freedom of movement of CTN leaders and members within the country and states that trade union pluralism is one of the Government's principles, a principle which is respected in the country, as is proved by the fact that the CTN registers the unions which affiliate to it with the Department of Trade Union Associations, carries out activities in the various departments of the country, places announcements concerning them in the newspapers and makes statements in the various media.
.Referring to the alleged attacks on the premises of the CTN, the Government adds that it is entirely false that members of the people's militia and the army take part in inter-union problems or participate in disturbances on the streets. The Government points out that it does not participate in ,problems of trade union conflict and that when it has intervened it has done so through its police force responsible for internal order so as to avoid more serious problems.
.Finally, the Government expresses surprise at the complainants' statement that Messrs Huembes, Altamirano and Castillo are in imminent danger and points out that respect for and protection of life constitute one of the fundamental principles in the Statute of Rights and Guarantees of Nicaraguans.
.The Committee observes that in the present complaint the complainants have alleged a series of violations of freedom of association within the context of a systematic campaign by the Government to destroy the CTN.
.As regards the prison sentences on trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Juan Suazo, a leader of the Aceites Corona Union, was sentenced to  days' imprisonment for disrespect to authority; Luis Mora, President of the Press Workers' Union, to one year's imprisonment for the offence of embezzlement of the assets of the Plsticos Record Factory, and Benito Caldern, a member of the CTN, to",1,1982,Nicaragua
158," months' imprisonment for cattle stealing. The Committee observes, however, that, according to the complainants, the reason why Juan Suazo was sentenced for disrespect to authority was allegedly that he refused to shake bands with a member of the Junta of National Reconstruction, when the latter visited his work centre. The Committee also observes that the version of the facts described by the complainants has not been explicitly denied by the Government, which has confined itself in its reply to stating the type of offence allegedly committed by the above trade union officials. In this respect, the Committee considers that the behaviour of Juan Suazo does not appear to have warranted the application of penal sanctions. In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that, in view of the date of the allegations, Seor Suazo must already have served his sentence of  days imprisonment, the Committee regrets the sentencing of this trade union leader and express the hope that he has already been reinstated in his trade union functions.
.Concerning the detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government, Ins Sequeira, Luis Avenor, Jos Eriteo, Arsenio Cruz and Asuncin Sequeira do not appear in the records of detained persons. The Committee observes however that it appears from the Government's statements that Salvador Snchez, Martin Torres and Roger Alonso have been released and that the judicial authority did not uphold any charges against them. In this respect, the Committee would point out to the Government that measures of preventive detention against trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights are: contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.As for the allegations concerning restrictions -on the freedom of movement of CTN leaders and members within the country and the systematic defamatory attacks against the CTN and its leaders in the official media without permission to exercise the right of reply, the Committee takes note that the Government denies that there are restrictions on the freedom of movement of CTN leaders and members within the country and states that the principle of trade union pluralism is respected and, more particularly, that the CTN registers the unions which affiliate to it with the competent authority, carries out activities in the various departments of the country, places announcements concerning them in newspapers and makes statements in the various media. In these circumstances, and in the absence of more specific information in support of these allegations, the Committee considers that these allegations do not call for further examination.
.With respect to the alleged attacks on the premises of the CTN by crowds including members of the militia and the Sandinista army, the Committee notes that the Government denies that the militia and the army participated in the above attacks, and that it seems to place the events in the context of problems of trade union rivalry. The Committee has pointed out that matters of inter-union rivalry are in principle outside the scope of the Conventions concerning freedom of association. It has also stated, however, that violence resulting from inter-union rivalry might constitute an attempt to impede the free exercise of trade union rights. If this were the case, and if the acts in question were sufficiently serious, it appears that the intervention of the authorities, in particular the police, would be called for in order to provide adequate protection of these rights. The question of infringement of trade union rights by the Government would only arise to the extent to which it may have acted improperly on the alleged assaults. In the present case the Committee would draw the attention of the Government to the necessity in such circumstances, of taking adequate measures to ensure the protection of trade union rights.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not replied to the allegations of threats against the lives of trade union leaders by the official militia, of physical attacks by the authorities on members of the CTN working on State-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations, of the members of the Executive Committee of the CTN being forbidden to leave the country and of the sugar workers affiliated to the CTN being prevented from entering their work centres. The Committee, accordingly, requests the Government to send its observations on these matters at an early date.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) With regard to the prison sentence imposed on the trade union leader Juan Suazo, since, as appears from the date of the allegations, he must already have served his sentence of  days imprisonment, the Committee regrets the sentencing of this trade union leader for behaviour which does not appear to have warranted the application of penal sanctions; it expresses the hope that he has now been reinstated in his trade union functions.(b) With regard to the detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists, the Committee notes that Salvador Snchez, Martin Torres and Roger Alonso have been released and that the judicial authority upheld no charges against them, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of preventive detention against trade union leaders and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights are contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) With regard to the allegations of restrictions on the freedom of movement of CTN officials and members within the country, the defamatory attacks against the CTN and its leaders in the official media, the Committee considers that they do not call for further examination.(d) With regard to the alleged attacks on the CTN premises the Committee would point out that, although matters of inter-union rivalry are in principle outside the scope of the Conventions on freedom of association, violence resulting from inter-union, rivalry may call for intervention by the authorities in order to ensure the protection of trade union rights.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send at an early date its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied: namely, threats against the lives of trade union leaders by the official militia; physical attacks by the authorities on CTN members working on State controlled banana estates and sugar plantations; members of the Executive Committee of the CTN being forbidden to leave the country; and sugar workers affiliated to the CTN being prevented from entering their work centres.",-1,1982,Nicaragua
159,".The Committee considered case No,  at its March  Session and presented an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government subsequently sent its observations in communications of  July and  September . The complaint figuring in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) dated  March . The Government replied in communications of  April,  May,  July and  September .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which remain outstanding in Case No.  relate to the dismissal without justifiable cause of  workers of the Javier Guerra (Mandaime) sugar mill in June , to the dismissal of  members of the Urban Transport Workers' Union and to the detention of the national officials of the Central of Workers of Nicaragua (CTN), Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo, whose lives have furthermore, allegedly been threatened. As the Government had failed to reply to these allegations, the Committee requested it to send its observations on the matter.
.The WCL alleges in its communication of  March  that Decrees Nos.  of ,  of  and  of , promulgated by the Government, constitute a serious infringement of the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike and openly contravene ILO Conventions Nos.  and . The WCL adds that the Government intends to impose a new law on public information media limiting the exercise of trade union rights and freedom of expression by trade union organisations.
.Lastly, the WCL alleges that the following trade union leaders of the CTN have been arbitrarily arrested: Rito Rivas, Daniel Garcia, Modesto Lpez, Carlos Prez, Mximo Valle, Domingo Prez, Heriberto Torres, Gabino Toruno and Eugenio Membreno.
.The Government states that only  workers were dismissed at the Javier Guerra sugar mill and that they presented a claim against the mill; the case was settled on appeal by the relevant court decision which the Government supplies. According to this decision,  workers have accepted payment of the indemnities provided for by law on dismissal and, as a result, the question of reinstating them does not arise. Thirteen others were to be reinstated in their jobs and  others, (Lorenzo Ruiz Narvaez, Mario Narvaez Fonseca, Ricardo Dumas Guadamuz, Domingo Calderon Zuniga, Ignacio Carballo Navarro, Enrique Barberena Pena, Candido Aburto Tercero, Jos Vicente Trana Chavez, Carlos Talavera Fletes, Manuel Antonio Guadamuz Lezama, Orlando Jos Carballo Bonilla, Gonzalo Morales Chavez, Calixto Alberto Estrada Reyes, Ramona Gonzalez Salas and Yadira Ruiz de Sequeira) were to be dismissed and paid indemnities. The judicial decision in question dismisses the action taken by these  workers for reinstatement since, although no just cause for dismissal was shown, the workers in question, for their part, have not proved that the action so taken was repressive towards the trade union.
.The Government adds that the dismissal of the urban transport workers was due to problems completely unrelated to the trade union sphere. According to the Government, when it was discovered that many drivers were not handing over all the proceeds of the day's fares, it was decided to institute another system of ticket sales which would allow better control. Some of the drivers, the Government continues, opposed the measure and even damaged some of the vehicles. After discussions had been started with the union and its officers understood that the measure taken was correct, the dismissed workers were reinstated except those who, considering themselves adversely affected by the measure, preferred not to go on working.
.In addition, the Government states that Decree No.  of  September , under which ""the negotiation and adoption of a collective agreement are necessarily subject to the approval of the Ministry of Labour, in accordance with the procedures established by the latter"", in no way restricts the right to free collective bargaining. According to the Government, the abovementioned rule is not imposed, but is applied by means of continual dialogue between the parties and the representative of the labour authority until a consensus is reached. If none is reached, the parties are free to enter into procedures established by the law before arbitration tribunals. The Government adds that the use of the tripartite method has been so effective that to date there has been only one case where the parties have gone to an arbitration tribunal. As regards Decrees Nos.  (Economic and Social Emergency Act) and  (Act Suspending the Provisions on Striking and Work Stoppage and Procedures for Settling Economic and Social Disputes), the Government states that they have been repealed by Decree No.  (National Emergency Act of  March ). As regards the Act on public information media, the Government states that the idea of a new law did not come from the Government, but that the Bills were submitted by the Patriotic Front of the Revolution (consisting of parties which support the Government) and the Democratic Coordinator (consisting of parties of the opposition), respectively. However, discussion of both Bills has now been interrupted.
.As regards the allegations concerning detentions, the Government states that Domingo Prez Rivera, Daniel Garcia Cruz and Carlos Prez were released on  and  August  and  March  respectively, that Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo have been released and that Modesto Lpez, Mximo Valle, Heriberto Torres, Gabino Toruno and Rito Rivas do not appear on the list of detainees. The Government also points out that Eugenio Membreno, detained on  December , is serving a four-year prison sentence for inflicting physical injury on another person.
.The allegations contained in the present complaint concern the dismissal of trade unionists, the conformity of various legislative texts or Bills with the Conventions on freedom of association and the arbitrary detention of trade union leaders.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, only  workers at the Javier Guerra sugar mill were dismissed, and that the case was settled by a decision of the appeal court. The decision of the appeal court has been sent to the Committee. From an examination of the decision in question, the Committee observes that  workers accepted legal indemnities on their dismissal and that the question of their reinstatement does not therefore arise. The Court has also ordered the reinstatement of  workers. However, as regards the  other workers, the decision dismisses the action taken by them for reinstatement since, although no just cause for dismissal was shown, these workers, for their part, have not proved that they were, as they alleged, the object of repressive, anti-union action. In this connection the Committee would recall that, in previous cases, a worker may find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination, Since, therefore, the management of Javier Guerra have not been able to show just cause for the dismissal of these  workers, the Committee requests the Government to take measures towards their reinstatement.
.The Committee also takes note of the Government's statements regarding the allegation of  members of the Urban Transport Workers' Union. The Committee notes in particular that after discussions with the Union's officers, the dismissed workers were reinstated except for those who preferred not to go on working because of the introduction of the new system of ticket sales. Consequently, the Committee considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.As regards Decree No.  of , which stipulates that ""the negotiation and adoption of a collective agreement are necessarily subject to the approval of the Ministry of Labour"", the Committee observes that the question whether the said Decree conforms to Convention No.  was considered by the Committee when it examined Case No.  at its May  session. Although it notes the Government's statements on the matter, the Committee must refer to its conclusions on that occasion, and draw the Government's attention in particular to the fact that the requirement of ministerial approval before a collective agreement can become valid is not in conformity with the principle of voluntary collective bargaining, established by Convention No. .
.The Committee also notes that Decrees Nos.  and , to which the complainant also objected, have been repealed by Decree No.  (National Emergency Act of  March ). In this respect, the Committee would refer to the conclusions it has reached in Case No.  (examined in the present report, see paragraphs ,  and ) concerning the effects on trade union activity of this Act and of the Acts prolonging the state of emergency.
.As regards the allegation concerning the intention to impose a new law on public information media which would limit the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, two Bills have been submitted by political parties supporting the Government and by political parties of the opposition, respectively. The Committee observes that the allegations of the complainant are not specific;",0,1982,Nicaragua
160,"in particular, neither has the complainant referred to any specific provisions to which exception could be taken from the viewpoint of the principles of freedom of association, nor has it supplied the text of the Bills in question. Consequently, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not at present call for further examination.
.Lastly, as regards the allegations concerning the detention of trade union leaders of the CTN, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Modesto Lpez, Maximo Valle, Heriberto Torres, Gabino Toruno and Rito Rivas do not appear on the lists of detainees, while Eugenio Membreno is serving a four-year prison sentence for inflicting physical injury on another person. The Committee observes, however, that although Domingo Prez Rivera, Daniel Garcia Cruz and Carlos Prez have been released, it is not clear from the Government's statement whether legal proceedings were instituted or whether the legal authority brought charges against the trade union leaders in question. The Committee also notes that the Government has limited itself to stating that Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo have been released without denying that they had been detained. Consequently, the Committee, while noting that these five trade unionists have now been released, draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders for activities relating to the exercise of their trade union functions is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and the following conclusions in particular:(a) As regards the dismissal of  workers at the Javier Guerra sugar mill, the Committee requests the Government to take steps towards the reinstatement of the  workers who are still dismissed.(b) As regards the dismissal of  members of the Urban Transport workers' Union, the Committee notes that the dismissed workers have been reinstated with the exception of those who preferred not to go on working, and therefore considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.(c) As regards the allegations concerning Decrees Nos. ,  and , the Committee refers to its conclusions on Cases Nos.  and  which concern the restrictions still in force regarding collective bargaining and strikes.(d) As regards the allegation concerning the intention to impose a new law on public information media which would limit the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not at present call for further examination.(e). As regards the allegations concerning the detention of trade union leaders Domingo Prez Rivera, Daniel Garcia Cruz, Carlos Prez, Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo, while the Committee notes that they have now been released, it draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders for activities related to the exercise of their trade union functions is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.",0,1982,Nicaragua
161,".The complaint is contained in communications from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), dated  February and  October . The Government replied in communications dated  July and  November .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining convention,  (No. ).
.The IOE alleges that on  February  Enrique Bolaos Gayer, acting chairman of the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP), was prevented from boarding a flight to Panama en route for Caracas, where the following day he was to participate in a forum on economic co-operation between the Nicaraguan and Venezuelan sectors. According to the complainant his passport was confiscated and he was summoned to appear before the Minister of the Interior.
.The IOE adds that the Sandinista Government has, on various occasions, prohibited employer leaders from travelling abroad, in some cases denying them a visa and in others in spite of their having one. The IOE indicates that Enrique Dreifus, Chairman of the COSEP, Ismael Reyes, Vice-Chairman of the COSEP, William Bez, Assistant Director of the INDE, Rosendo Diaz, Executive Secretary of the Union of Agricultural Producers, and Alejandro Burgos, Executive Director of the COSEP, have been subjected to travel bans on various occasions.
.As regards the employer leader Mr. Bolaos, the Government states that the problem was caused by a misunderstanding on the part of the emigration authorities at the Augusto Csar Sandino Airport but that, once it had been cleared up, Mr. Bolaos was able to make his journey without any problem.
.As regards the other employer leaders, the Government denies that their journeys abroad were prohibited and provides an extensive list with the dates on which, for various reasons, Messrs. Enrique Dreifus, Ismael Reyes, William Bez- and Alejandro Burgos travelled abroad.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the fact that the acting chairman of the COSEP, Mr. Bolaos Gayer, was prevented from boarding a flight to Panama en route for Caracas, where he was due to participate in a forum on economic co-operation, was caused by a misunderstanding on the part of the emigration authorities at the Augusto Csar Sandino Airport. The Committee also notes that, once the misunderstanding had been cleared up, Mr. Bolaos was able to make his Journey without any problem.
.The Committee notes, moreover, that the Government denies the allegation that it has prohibited the employer leaders, Messrs. Dreifus, Reyes, Bez and Burgos, from making journeys and that it has forwarded an extensive list with the dates on which, for various reasons, these leaders have travelled abroad.
.The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not sent specific information on the prohibition or prohibitions on leaving the country to which, according to the complainant organisation, Mr. Rosendo Diaz, Executive Secretary of the Union of Agricultural Producers, was subjected. In these circumstances, the Committee recalls that representatives of workers and employers should enjoy appropriate facilities for carrying out their functions, including the right to leave the country when their activities on behalf of the persons they represent so require.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular to recall to the Government that representatives of workers and employers should enjoy appropriate facilities for carrying out their functions, including the right to leave the country when their activities on behalf of the persons they represent so require.",0,1982,Nicaragua
162,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  December . Additional information was supplied by the ICFTU in a communication dated  April . The Government replied in communications dated  February and  May .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The ICFTU states that a course on training methodology for Latin American trade union instructors at the International Centre for Advanced Technical and Vocational Training took place in Turin from  August to  November , and that a fellowship has been offered to the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) and another to the Sandinist Confederation of Nicaraguan Workers (CST), each of which was to designate a participant. According to the complainant, while the CST representative obtained the Government's permission, the CUS representative, Mr. Germn Reyes, this organisation's secretary for labour disputes, was denied such permission.
.The complainant states that on  August , the Turin Centre received a telex from the UNDP office in Managua saying that the CST candidate had been approved by the Ministry of Planning but that the CUS candidate had not applied to the Ministry for an authorisation. Subsequently, a telex of  September , also sent by the UNDP office in Managua, stated that the Nicaraguan Government had not approved the participation of either of the two candidates.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that it learned, through conversations with the office of International Relations of the CST, that this organisation's delegate for the course in Turin, Mr. Mario Ramirez, was unable to attend since he had not presented his papers to the migration offices in time and consequently could not obtain a passport and an exit visa early enough. As regards the CUS delegate, Mr. Germn Reyes, the Government states that he applied for a passport and a visa on  August , which were delivered to him four days later, i.e. on  September . The Government has sent an official attestation to corroborate these statements.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that it obtained the following explanations concerning the complaint from the Permanent Resident Representative of the UNDP in Nicaragua:- since the Turin Centre is an institution belonging to the United Nations system, any co-operation must as a rule be channelled through the UNDP office in the country in question;- the UNDP will not authorise any co-operation unless approved by the body responsible for co-operation in the country (in the present case, the Ministry of Planning);- consequently, the UNDP representative contacted the CST and the CUS, informing them that it could give no authorisation unless the designated trade union delegates applied to the Ministry of Planning for the necessary authorisation;- the CST delegate applied to the Ministry of Planning for the necessary authorisation, which was granted, but the CUS delegate did not, despite the fact that the UNDP reminded the CUS of the need to do so;- in these circumstances, since the time for the trade union delegates to leave for Turin had expired, the UNDP representative and the competent authority of the Ministry of Planning decided that, in order to avoid any problems between the trade union organisations and any impression of partiality, it was preferable that neither of the delegates should go, even though the CST delegate had obtained the necessary authorisation.
.The Government concludes by stating that if it had had to intervene in this matter, it was precisely to see that the UNDP could authorise the fellowships for the trade union delegates in question; it did not do so because its authorisation is normally required, and it certainly did not do so to prevent the trade union organisations from participating in international events.
.The Committee takes note of the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply. It notes in particular that, according to the Government, if the CUS delegate was unable to attend the trade union training course at the International Centre for Advanced Technical and Vocational Training in Turin, it was because, although he had obtained a passport and a visa, he had not applied to the Ministry of Planning for the necessary authorisation. The Committee notes that the CST delegate applied for and obtained the necessary authorisation but not a passport, having failed to produce the necessary papers in time. The Committee also notes that the UNDP Resident Representative and the competent authority of the Ministry of Planning decided that, in order to avoid any problems between the trade union organisations, it was preferable that neither of the two delegates should attend the course, even though the CST delegate had obtained the necessary authorisation.
.The Committee observes that the Government's reply indicates that the authorisation by the Ministry of Planning for the trade union delegates to attend the trade union training course at the Turin Centre is not an authorisation normally required by the Government, but seems rather to be a procedural requirement of the UNDP co-operation programmes. Since, according to the information available to the Committee, the fellowships awarded to the CUS and the CST were not financed by the UNDP - whose representative acted only as a mediator in the matter - but by another organisation, the authorisation of the Ministry of Planning need not have been required since the UNDP programme procedure was not applicable. The Committee, therefore, can only regret that, owing to a bureaucratic procedure for which the authorities were not entirely responsible, the CUS and CST delegates were unable to attend the trade union training course given by the international Centre for Advanced Technical and Vocational Training in Turin. The Committee trusts that in future the participation of trade union leaders and members in training courses abroad will not be hindered.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee regrets that, owing to a bureaucratic procedure for which the authorities were not entirely responsible, the CUS and CST delegates were unable to attend the trade union training course given by the international Centre for Advanced and Vocational Training in Turin for which they had been awarded fellowships, and trusts that in future the participation of trade union leaders and members in training courses abroad will not be hindered.",0,1981,Nicaragua
163,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) dated  October  alleging the detention of several employer leaders prominent in the Nicaraguan employers' organisations. The TOE sent further information in communications of  and  October,  and  November  and  February .
.In view of the gravity of the allegations, the Director-General of the ILO firstly sent a telegram to the Government on  October  requesting it to communicate whatever steps had been taken towards the rapid release of the prisoners and then addressed a further telegram on  October  to the Government expressing the wish to send a high-ranking official to Nicaragua at a near date to discuss this matter with the government authorities. In a communication of  November , the Government stated that it accepted the sending of a mission.
.The Government sent its observations on the allegations in letters dated  January and  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The IOE alleges that after a denunciation by the Public Prosecutor, and in an effort to smash management sector institutions, state security agents arbitrarily and unjustly arrested, on  October , Enrique Dreyfus, Gilberto Cuadra, Benjamin Lanzas and Enrique Bolnos, the President and Vice-President respectively of the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise in Nicaragua (COSEP). They had allegedly violated the provisions of the Act concerning the Maintenance of Public Order and Security (sections (c)(), (), () and ()) and the Act declaring a State of Economic and Social Emergency (section (c) and (h)) by signing and publishing a letter on  October  addressed to Commander Daniel Ortega, Co-ordinator of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction, which criticises the Marxist-Leninist direction taken by the Sandinist Revolution and the contents of which appear to represent the general opinion of the Nicaraguan private sector.
.The complainant points out that, in violation of Convention No. , the legal provisions upon which the Public Prosecutor based his charges unacceptably limit freedom of expression which is necessary for the normal exercise of trade union rights and violate the principle of freedom of information which is vital to freedom of association.
.The complainant adds that after a summary investigation, the employer leaders of COSEP, Enrique Dreyfus, Gilberto Cuadra and Benjamin Lanzas were sentenced to seven months' imprisonment and compulsory labour, a decision which was solely aimed at decapitating the employers' movement. A copy of the court's decision, dated  October , is supplied by the complainant.
.According to the complainant's communication of  October , the imprisoned COSEP leaders have been subjected to inhumane treatment. In particular they have not been allowed to receive necessary medication, nor visits and they are kept in extremely unclean and unhygienic conditions. The complainant points out moreover in this communication that the bases of the private sector have been mobilised and are signing the letter sent to Commander Daniel Ortega on  October .
.Lastly, in its telegram of  February , the IOE announces the release of Messrs. Dreyfus, Cuadra and Lanzas and expresses its deep gratitude to the ILO for its efforts taken towards their release.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that on  October , COSEP broadcast through the Managua Radio Corporation the text of a letter addressed to Commander Daniel Ortega, Co-ordinator of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction, signed by several COSEP members and which was allegedly published later in the daily newspaper ""La Prensa"" - which gave rise to a series of criticisms from various sectors of the country - monstrously accusing the revolutionary leaders of preparing ""a new wave of genocide in Nicaragua"". It states that this was a new attempt by COSEP to create artificially confrontation between private enterprise and the revolutionary power and people, only because Commander Humberto Ortega Saavedra, the Minister of Defence, had urged them to join in the defence of the revolutionary process. The Government points out that, obstreperously, the COSEP ordered its followers to refuse to participate in the process of national reconstruction which was an attempt to invalidate the firm wish of the Sandinist National Liberation Front to maintain political pluralism and a mixed economy which for the last two years has kept them happy. It also points out that, in the letter, the COSEP members, alarmed to the deepest of their selling-out-the country interests by the Minister of Defence's statements, instead of responding with a positive patriotic attitude against the dangers of aggression and intervention in Nicaragua, persisted in their lies of ""lack of liberty"" while sending copies of their letter to international organisations - such as the IOE - in an interventionist eagerness to show their difficulties.
.The Government also states that the COSEP leaders appeared before the Criminal Court of First Instance in Managua on  October  accused by the Public Prosecutor of violating the Act concerning the Maintenance of Public Order and Security (section (c)(), (), () and ()) and the Act declaring a State of Economic and Social Emergency No.  (section (c) and (h)).
.According to the Government, on  October , the trial was opened for the presentation of evidence and the defendants gave their statements unanimously rejecting the charges against them, after which the Public Prosecutor withdrew all charges against Mr. Bolnos Geyer who had proved that he had not signed the letter. The Government adds that in view of forensic medicine examination of Mr. Bolnos Geyer, he was referred by the judge of the Criminal Court to the Bautista Hospital of Managua since, according to the legal medical opinion, he was unable to remain in prison because of his oesophageal hernia and gastric ulcer.
.The Government states that, according to the judgement handed down on  October  concerning the arrested COSEP members (of which it supplies a copy), Enrique Bolnos Geyer was acquitted as there was no case for him to answer. Enrique Dreyfus Morales, Benjamin Lanzas Delva and Gilberto Cuadra Solrzano were acquitted as regards the charges under section (c) and (h) of the Act declaring a State of Economic and Social Emergency because the judge considered that the charges had not been substantiated; they were nevertheless sentenced to seven months' imprisonment and compulsory labour for violating section  of the Act concerning the Maintenance of Public Order and Security for attacking firstly the national security and economy, and secondly the maintenance of order and prevention of crime.
.The Government points out that the above-mentioned judgement was appealed on the grounds that it was not in conformity with the law and adds that on  November  the Court of Criminal Appeal of Masaya confirmed the sentence of seven months' imprisonment and compulsory labour against the three COSEP leaders and the acquittal granted by the judge at First Instance to Enrique Bolnos Geyer, a member of the executive board of COSEP. The Government supplies a copy of this decision.
.Lastly, in its communication of  February , the Government states that Messrs. Dreyfus, Cuadra and Lanzas have been released.
.As has been pointed out above, the Director-General - in accordance with the procedure in force - sent a telegram on  October  to the Government requesting it as a matter of urgency to consent to an ILO mission to discuss the questions relating to this case with the Nicaraguan authorities, a request which was agreed to by the Government in its communication of  November .
.The mission was carried out on  November to  December  by the Director-General's representative Mr. Ian Lagergren, Chief of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Manuel Araoz, Chief of the Freedom of Association Branch, who were accompanied by Mr. Daniel de Patoul, an ILO associate expert.
.Before proceeding to Managua, the mission stopped over for a few days in San Jos, Costa Pica, where it was able to track down two Nicaraguan employer leaders in self-imposed exile in Costa Rica: Mr. Ramiro Gurdin, Vice-President of COSEP, and Mr. Jaime Bengoechea, Director of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Industries (CADIN). Messrs. Gurdin and Bengoechea confirmed that three of the four persons referred to in the IOE's complaint (Enrique Dreyfus, Gilberto Cuadra and Benjamin Lanzas) were under detention for having put their signatures to a letter of  October  addressed by the boards of the different private sector organisations grouped within COSEP to Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra, Co-ordinator of the Government of National Reconstruction; this letter had, inter alia, been seriously critical of the economic and social policies pursued by the Government of Nicaragua. The fourth person referred to in the IOE's complaint (Mr. Enrique Bolnos) had been released from detention since he had not been amongst the signatories to the letter in question.
.When in Nicaragua, the mission had talks with the Minister of Justice, Mr. Ernesto Castillo (on two occasions), the Minister of Labour, Sr. Virgilio Godoy, the Public Prosecutor,",0,1981,Nicaragua
164,"Sr. Alberto Gmez, and with the President of the Court of Appeal of Masaya, Sr. Rafael Chamorro Mora and a number of his co-judges. The mission also held talks with Monsignor Miguel Obando y Bravo, Archbishop of Managua, with defence counsel for the three arrested leaders, with the Nicaraguan Permanent Commission for Human Rights, and with various trade union organisations. A meeting also took place with COSEP at its headquarters, COSEP's main spokesman being Sr. Ismael Reyes Icabalceto, Acting President. The mission paid a two-hour visit to the prisoners in jail in the absence of any outside witnesses. Finally, the mission was received by Dr. Rafael Crdova Rivas, member of the Government Junta and responsible for matters relating, inter alia, to the judiciary, a meeting at which the Ministers of Justice and Labour were also present.
.The situation of Messrs. Dreyfus, Cuadra and Lanzas was as follows at the time when the mission arrived in Nicaragua. Arrested on  October, charges were brought against them by the Public Prosecutor on  October who contended that by signing and giving widespread publicity to the letter of  October they had acted in contravention of section  of Act No.  of  September  declaring a State of Economic and Social Emergency, which reads as follows:Section . For purposes of this Act, the following are regarded as offences against national economic and social security and are punishable by imprisonment of from one to three years:Paragraph c) - Spreading false information intended to bring about changes in prices, wages, provisions, produce, merchandise, shares, securities and moneys.Paragraph h) - Incitement of foreign governments and international credit institutions to encash securities or to take decisions damaging to the national economy.as well as violation of section  of Act No.  of  July  concerning the Maintenance of Public Order and Security, which reads as follows:Section . The following offences are punishable with detention and compulsory labour of from  days to  years:Paragraph c) - Spreading by word of mouth or in writing statements, publications or public declarations attacking:
.national security and standing public security and the national economy;
.the maintenance of order and prevention of crime;
.the protection of the health, morals, personal dignity, reputation and rights of others;
.the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
.On  October  the Court of First Instance in Managua upheld the charges brought under the Public order and security Act and sentenced Messrs. Dreyfus, Cuadra and Lanzas to seven months' imprisonment and compulsory labour. However, the charges brought under the economic and social emergency legislation were dismissed. Release on bail was refused. On  November  the Court of Appeal at Masaya rejected the appeal from defence counsel and confirmed the sentence of the Court of First Instance.
.In the discussions held with the Minister of Justice and with the Minister of Labour it was pointed out that the purpose of the mission was not to express views on the economic, social and political system prevailing in Nicaragua. The ILO's sole concern was with the repercussions of the prevailing system and of legislation introduced on the exercise of freedom of association. On that particular score, serious allegations had been made by the IOE which, if substantiated, would constitute gross violation of the ILO's standards and principles in this field. It appeared to the mission from the material available to it that the recent enactments to which reference has been made placed serious restrictions on the right to express opinions freely through the press or otherwise, thereby severely restricting one of the essential elements of trade union rights. The fact that three prominent leaders of the employers' organisations were serving prison sentences for having expressed their views on the manner in which the country was being governed gave rise to very serious concern, as did certain allegations received concerning inhumane treatment of the prisoners (no right to receive visitors, denial of medical care, etc.).
.The general thrust of the Government's replies was as follows. The mission was surely aware of the political upheavals that had taken place in Nicaragua, bordering on civil war and leading to the overthrow of the Somoza regime and the coming into power of the Sandinists. The country was in a difficult period of national reconstruction, was subjected to political pressures from the outside world, and was suffering also from political tensions at home that threatened to destabilise the country. Therefore the Government considered it absolutely necessary to introduce certain emergency enactments to safeguard public order and security. Such measures were, however, only of a temporary nature and would be abolished as soon as the situation became stabilised. In this process of stabilisation, COSEP had not been playing a constructive but a destructive role. It had become a political rather than a professional organisation. No government would accept the defamatory statements contained in COSEP's letter of  October , such as the one accusing the Government of preparing ""a new wave of genocide in Nicaragua, the victims of which will be all those who exercise their right to disagree"". The three leaders of COSEP, signatories to the letter in question had freely chosen their defence counsel, had been tried and convicted under due process of law and were sentenced to seven months' imprisonment and compulsory labour. Under Act No.  of  April  persons sentenced to public works could have the obligation to work replaced by a fine. In fact, Messrs. Dreyfus, Cuadra and Lanzas were not forced to carry out any kind of forced or compulsory labour.
.In this connection, the mission stated that it was not calling into question the manner in which the proceedings against the three prisoners in question had been conducted, but the compatibility of the legislation under which they had been convicted with ILO standards and principles in the field of freedom of association. It. was understandable that the Government had resented the accusations regarding a new wave of genocide, but the strong language used by the employers should be seen as their understandable reaction to a statement made a few days earlier by the minister of Defence, Commander Humberto Ortega, according to which the nation must establish a list of potentially counterrevolutionary individuals, ""who will be the first to be left hanging in the streets"". The Government had repeatedly stated that it wished to maintain a ""mixed economy"" in co-operation with the private sector employers. It did not appear conducive to such cooperation to throw these same employers into jail for having expressed their views on the state of the country, albeit in strong terms. The mission very much hoped that the present confrontation between the Government and COSEP would cease, and that a measure of common ground could be found in the interests of the country as a whole. Early release of the three prisoners would be a highly desirable step in the right direction,
.The mission subsequently visited Messrs. Dreyfus, Cuadra and Lanzas in their prison. The meeting took place in the absence of any outside witnesses and lasted for close to two hours. The prisoners stated that during the first  days of detention they had been kept in isolation from each other in minute cells with little or no light, their diet had consisted solely of rice and black beans which they had to eat with their hands; they could visit the toilets only  times every  hours, at predetermined times. Since then their conditions had improved and were now quite tolerable. Access to medical care was available, if needed, and they could now receive visits from their families once a week. Sanitary conditions were now adequate. At no time had they been physically maltreated. They were not required to carry out any kind of labour. They felt, however, that they had access to their defence counsel too seldom, only two visits having been authorised in five weeks. The mission raised this matter with the Minister of Justice at a later meeting, who promised to see to it that no obstacles were placed in the way of contacts between the prisoners and defence counsel. All three prisoners were greatly encouraged by the visit of the mission and by the efforts being undertaken by the ILO on their behalf.
.A meeting was held with several leaders of COSEP at their headquarters. They, too, were highly appreciative of the ILO's efforts to intervene on behalf of their colleagues. In their view, it was not COSEP but the Government which had sought the confrontation that had arisen and which placed their own liberty and security in peril. The action taken by the Government against their colleagues violated not only ILO standards and principles, but also the basic Constitutional laws of Nicaragua and the American Convention on Human Rights. They considered that procedural irregularities had led to the refusal to release their colleagues on bail, and were concerned about the difficulties they claimed that defence counsel were encountering in gaining access to the prisoners.
.The visit to the President of the Court of Appeal",0,1981,Nicaragua
165,"at Masaya and a number of his co-judges produced no useful results. In particular, it did not prove possible to obtain any clear information as to the position in Nicaragua when national law enters into conflict with the terms of a ratified international treaty, or as to the extent to which the judiciary in exercising its functions takes into account the terms of such treaties or Conventions.
.During the meeting with Dr. Rafael Crdova Rivas, member of the Government Junta, and the Ministers of Justice and of Labour, Dr. Crdova Rivas was asked whether he would, in the interests of restoring a climate of dialogue rather than confrontation, taking into account the good relations that had always existed between Nicaragua and the ILO, and considering the obligations undertaken by Nicaragua in ratifying Convention No. , he ready to provide his good offices in ensuring the early release from prison of Messrs. Dreyfus, Cuadra and Lanzas. In reply, Dr. Crdova Rivas stated that he had himself been in prison several times during the Somoza regime, but he had never served the full sentence. However, he could not assure the mission that the prisoners would be released ""tomorrow"", but he would use his powers to ensure their release.
.The Committee takes note of the complainant's allegations, the Government's reply and the information obtained by the direct contacts mission which took place in Nicaragua from  November to  December . The Committee further notes with satisfaction that the Government of Nicaragua accepted the proposal of the Director-General of the ILO to have an ILO mission examine with the Nicaraguan authorities the questions at issue in this case.
.The Committee notes that this complaint involves allegations that Messrs. Dreyfus, Bolaos, Cuadra and Lanzas, President and vice-Presidents respectively of COSEP, were arbitrarily and unjustly arrested on  October , received inhumane treatment during their detention and were later sentenced - with the exception of Mr. Bolaos who was acquitted as there was no case for him to answer - to seven months' imprisonment and compulsory labour for having signed and given wide publicity to a letter addressed to Commander Daniel Ortega, Co-ordinator of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction, which denounced the Government's Marxist-Leninist trend and which reflected the general opinion of the Nicaraguan private sector.
.In this connection, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the COSEP employer leaders in question were released on  February  and that in referring to the release of these persons, the IOE expressed its deep gratitude to the ILO for its efforts taken towards their release. In this connection, the Committee hopes that the release of these leaders will contribute positively to the restoration of a climate of dialogue rather than confrontation between the authorities and the employer sector. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that although the allegations revolved around the imprisonment of the COSEP employer leaders who are now free, it must examine the substance of these allegations in so far as they can be described as violations of freedom of association.
.In view of this reasoning, the Committee observes that the COSEP employer leaders were arrested because they signed and gave wide publicity to a letter on  October , this being alleged by the Public Prosecutor to be grounds for charges under section (c)(), (), () and () of the Act concerning the Maintenance of Public Order and Security and under section (c) and (h) of the Act declaring a State of Economic and Social Emergency. In this connection, after having carefully examined the Act declaring a State of Economic and Social Emergency, the Committee considers that several of its provisions involve serious restrictions on freedom of association and specifically on the freedom of action of the workers' and employers' organisations (see, for example, section (a) and (f)). Similarly, some of the types of crimes set out in the Act concerning the Maintenance of Public Order and Security are conceived in very general terms which may give rise to wide interpretations contrary to the full respect of the principle of security before the law - which is a fundamental objective of all legal systems -, this danger being reinforced by the description given of the types of crimes in section (c)(), (), () and () by the Appeal Court in its decision of  November  sentencing the COSEP employer leaders in which the crimes are listed as ""crimes of abstract danger"" in that - according to the decision - ""For the completion of the crime, it is sufficient that the acts of propaganda or diffusion laid down in the Act be carried out, without it being necessary that the actions of diffusion in writing of unlawful statements and manifestos whose distribution is prohibited produce any real damage to the juridically protected object"". The Committee further notes that the mission considered that the legislation referred to imposed serious restrictions on the right to express opinions freely through the press or otherwise, thereby severely restricting one of the essential elements of trade union rights. Accordingly, while noting that the government authorities stated to the mission that the above-mentioned Acts were of a temporary and emergency nature having been adopted during the difficult period of national reconstruction, and taking into account their consequences for the exercise of trade union rights and the civil liberties which are related to these rights, in particular the right to express and circulate ideas and opinions, the Committee would recall that according to Article () of Convention No. , ""The law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention"". It requests the Government to take steps towards the prompt amendment of these legislative provisions in accordance with the principles contained in Convention No.  and the Resolution on Trade Union Rights and their relation to Civil Liberties (adopted by the International Labour Conference in ) and would draw this aspect of the case to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.As regards the sentence of the COSEP employer leaders to seven months' imprisonment and compulsory labour for violating section (c)(), (), () and () of the Act concerning the maintenance of Public Order and Security, the Committee notes that the judgement handed down by the Criminal Court of First Instance on  October  cited the following opinions from the letter signed and published on  October  as a basis for the sentence: ""Our national economy is collapsing; there are no signs of a production revival; social peace is still not a reality; our foreign debts are increasing daily ... and mixed economy - which the government continues to say it advocates - is shunted as private property is taken over by the State, to the ignorance of the people ... We see a very clear Marxist-Leninist trend, which furthermore is confirmed in the statements made by leaders of the government ... You must understand that those whom you consider reactionaries on the domestic or international scene are not against the people of Nicaragua; they are opposed to the Marxist-Leninist programme you are imposing without the knowledge of the people. If other nations cut us off, it is for this reason ... We are almost at the point of no return, when the government will have difficulty in claiming legitimacy to the people ... What is worse, is that we can only interpret these statements as the preparation of a new wave of genocide in Nicaragua, the victims of which will be all those who exercise their right to disagree."" In this connection, the Committee notes that the mission stated that it was understandable that the Government had resented the accusations regarding a new wave of genocide, but the strong language used by the employers should be seen as their understandable reaction to a statement made a few days earlier by the Minister of Defence, Commander Humberto Ortega, according to which the nation must establish a list of potentially counter-revolutionary individuals ""who will be the first to be left hanging in the streets"". In these circumstances, the Committee, taking into account the telegram sent by the Director-General to the Government on  October  requesting the leaders to grant an early release to the prisoners, and in view of the above comments on the Act concerning the Maintenance of Public order and security - upon which the sentences were based - in particular those made by the mission to the effect that serious restrictions were placed on the right to freely express opinions, can only express its deep regret at the conviction and detention as well as the length of time the employer leaders had to spend in prison.
.Lastly, as regards the alleged inhumane treatment suffered by the COSEP employer leaders while in detention, the Committee notes that they themselves told the mission that during the first  days of detention they had been kept in isolation from",0,1981,Nicaragua
166,"each other in minute cells with little or no light enduring food and hygiene deficiencies as well, and they stated that they had only rarely been able to see their defence counsel. In this connection, while noting that after the first  days the conditions of detention were quite tolerable, the Committee draws to the attention of the Government the importance which it attaches to the fact that preventive detention should be accompanied by a set of safeguards and limitations to ensure that it cannot be used for purposes other than -hat for which it is designed and in particular to give protection against situations where the detention is unsatisfactory from the point of view of sanitation, unnecessary hardship or the right to defence.",1,1981,Nicaragua
167,".The Committee considered case No,  at its March  Session and presented an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government subsequently sent its observations in communications of  July and  September . The complaint figuring in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) dated  March . The Government replied in communications of  April,  May,  July and  September .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations which remain outstanding in Case No.  relate to the dismissal without justifiable cause of  workers of the Javier Guerra (Mandaime) sugar mill in June , to the dismissal of  members of the Urban Transport Workers' Union and to the detention of the national officials of the Central of Workers of Nicaragua (CTN), Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo, whose lives have furthermore, allegedly been threatened. As the Government had failed to reply to these allegations, the Committee requested it to send its observations on the matter.
.The WCL alleges in its communication of  March  that Decrees Nos.  of ,  of  and  of , promulgated by the Government, constitute a serious infringement of the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike and openly contravene ILO Conventions Nos.  and . The WCL adds that the Government intends to impose a new law on public information media limiting the exercise of trade union rights and freedom of expression by trade union organisations.
.Lastly, the WCL alleges that the following trade union leaders of the CTN have been arbitrarily arrested: Rito Rivas, Daniel Garcia, Modesto Lpez, Carlos Prez, Mximo Valle, Domingo Prez, Heriberto Torres, Gabino Toruno and Eugenio Membreno.
.The Government states that only  workers were dismissed at the Javier Guerra sugar mill and that they presented a claim against the mill; the case was settled on appeal by the relevant court decision which the Government supplies. According to this decision,  workers have accepted payment of the indemnities provided for by law on dismissal and, as a result, the question of reinstating them does not arise. Thirteen others were to be reinstated in their jobs and  others, (Lorenzo Ruiz Narvaez, Mario Narvaez Fonseca, Ricardo Dumas Guadamuz, Domingo Calderon Zuniga, Ignacio Carballo Navarro, Enrique Barberena Pena, Candido Aburto Tercero, Jos Vicente Trana Chavez, Carlos Talavera Fletes, Manuel Antonio Guadamuz Lezama, Orlando Jos Carballo Bonilla, Gonzalo Morales Chavez, Calixto Alberto Estrada Reyes, Ramona Gonzalez Salas and Yadira Ruiz de Sequeira) were to be dismissed and paid indemnities. The judicial decision in question dismisses the action taken by these  workers for reinstatement since, although no just cause for dismissal was shown, the workers in question, for their part, have not proved that the action so taken was repressive towards the trade union.
.The Government adds that the dismissal of the urban transport workers was due to problems completely unrelated to the trade union sphere. According to the Government, when it was discovered that many drivers were not handing over all the proceeds of the day's fares, it was decided to institute another system of ticket sales which would allow better control. Some of the drivers, the Government continues, opposed the measure and even damaged some of the vehicles. After discussions had been started with the union and its officers understood that the measure taken was correct, the dismissed workers were reinstated except those who, considering themselves adversely affected by the measure, preferred not to go on working.
.In addition, the Government states that Decree No.  of  September , under which ""the negotiation and adoption of a collective agreement are necessarily subject to the approval of the Ministry of Labour, in accordance with the procedures established by the latter"", in no way restricts the right to free collective bargaining. According to the Government, the abovementioned rule is not imposed, but is applied by means of continual dialogue between the parties and the representative of the labour authority until a consensus is reached. If none is reached, the parties are free to enter into procedures established by the law before arbitration tribunals. The Government adds that the use of the tripartite method has been so effective that to date there has been only one case where the parties have gone to an arbitration tribunal. As regards Decrees Nos.  (Economic and Social Emergency Act) and  (Act Suspending the Provisions on Striking and Work Stoppage and Procedures for Settling Economic and Social Disputes), the Government states that they have been repealed by Decree No.  (National Emergency Act of  March ). As regards the Act on public information media, the Government states that the idea of a new law did not come from the Government, but that the Bills were submitted by the Patriotic Front of the Revolution (consisting of parties which support the Government) and the Democratic Coordinator (consisting of parties of the opposition), respectively. However, discussion of both Bills has now been interrupted.
.As regards the allegations concerning detentions, the Government states that Domingo Prez Rivera, Daniel Garcia Cruz and Carlos Prez were released on  and  August  and  March  respectively, that Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo have been released and that Modesto Lpez, Mximo Valle, Heriberto Torres, Gabino Toruno and Rito Rivas do not appear on the list of detainees. The Government also points out that Eugenio Membreno, detained on  December , is serving a four-year prison sentence for inflicting physical injury on another person.
.The allegations contained in the present complaint concern the dismissal of trade unionists, the conformity of various legislative texts or Bills with the Conventions on freedom of association and the arbitrary detention of trade union leaders.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, only  workers at the Javier Guerra sugar mill were dismissed, and that the case was settled by a decision of the appeal court. The decision of the appeal court has been sent to the Committee. From an examination of the decision in question, the Committee observes that  workers accepted legal indemnities on their dismissal and that the question of their reinstatement does not therefore arise. The Court has also ordered the reinstatement of  workers. However, as regards the  other workers, the decision dismisses the action taken by them for reinstatement since, although no just cause for dismissal was shown, these workers, for their part, have not proved that they were, as they alleged, the object of repressive, anti-union action. In this connection the Committee would recall that, in previous cases, a worker may find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination, Since, therefore, the management of Javier Guerra have not been able to show just cause for the dismissal of these  workers, the Committee requests the Government to take measures towards their reinstatement.
.The Committee also takes note of the Government's statements regarding the allegation of  members of the Urban Transport Workers' Union. The Committee notes in particular that after discussions with the Union's officers, the dismissed workers were reinstated except for those who preferred not to go on working because of the introduction of the new system of ticket sales. Consequently, the Committee considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.As regards Decree No.  of , which stipulates that ""the negotiation and adoption of a collective agreement are necessarily subject to the approval of the Ministry of Labour"", the Committee observes that the question whether the said Decree conforms to Convention No.  was considered by the Committee when it examined Case No.  at its May  session. Although it notes the Government's statements on the matter, the Committee must refer to its conclusions on that occasion, and draw the Government's attention in particular to the fact that the requirement of ministerial approval before a collective agreement can become valid is not in conformity with the principle of voluntary collective bargaining, established by Convention No. .
.The Committee also notes that Decrees Nos.  and , to which the complainant also objected, have been repealed by Decree No.  (National Emergency Act of  March ). In this respect, the Committee would refer to the conclusions it has reached in Case No.  (examined in the present report, see paragraphs ,  and ) concerning the effects on trade union activity of this Act and of the Acts prolonging the state of emergency.
.As regards the allegation concerning the intention to impose a new law on public information media which would limit the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, two Bills have been submitted by political parties supporting the Government and by political parties of the opposition, respectively. The Committee observes that the allegations of the complainant are not specific;",0,1981,Nicaragua
168,"in particular, neither has the complainant referred to any specific provisions to which exception could be taken from the viewpoint of the principles of freedom of association, nor has it supplied the text of the Bills in question. Consequently, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not at present call for further examination.
.Lastly, as regards the allegations concerning the detention of trade union leaders of the CTN, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, Modesto Lpez, Maximo Valle, Heriberto Torres, Gabino Toruno and Rito Rivas do not appear on the lists of detainees, while Eugenio Membreno is serving a four-year prison sentence for inflicting physical injury on another person. The Committee observes, however, that although Domingo Prez Rivera, Daniel Garcia Cruz and Carlos Prez have been released, it is not clear from the Government's statement whether legal proceedings were instituted or whether the legal authority brought charges against the trade union leaders in question. The Committee also notes that the Government has limited itself to stating that Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo have been released without denying that they had been detained. Consequently, the Committee, while noting that these five trade unionists have now been released, draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders for activities relating to the exercise of their trade union functions is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and the following conclusions in particular:(a) As regards the dismissal of  workers at the Javier Guerra sugar mill, the Committee requests the Government to take steps towards the reinstatement of the  workers who are still dismissed.(b) As regards the dismissal of  members of the Urban Transport workers' Union, the Committee notes that the dismissed workers have been reinstated with the exception of those who preferred not to go on working, and therefore considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.(c) As regards the allegations concerning Decrees Nos. ,  and , the Committee refers to its conclusions on Cases Nos.  and  which concern the restrictions still in force regarding collective bargaining and strikes.(d) As regards the allegation concerning the intention to impose a new law on public information media which would limit the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not at present call for further examination.(e). As regards the allegations concerning the detention of trade union leaders Domingo Prez Rivera, Daniel Garcia Cruz, Carlos Prez, Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo, while the Committee notes that they have now been released, it draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders for activities related to the exercise of their trade union functions is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the Central of Workers of Nicaragua (CTN) presented their complaints in communications dated  June and  August , respectively. The Government replied in a communication dated  December .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, , (No. ).
.The Central of workers of Nicaragua (CTN) alleges that the Government is endeavouring to break up the organisation and the Confederation of Trade Union Unity (CUS) and has accordingly embarked upon a campaign of defamation, denial of freedom of association and persecution of union leaders. The CTN adds that the Government wants Nicaragua to have a single workers' federation.
.The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) indicates that the Government's repressive measures against the democratic trade union movement have taken the form of attacks against the CTN and its leaders, the dismissal without justifiable cause of  workers at the Javier Guerra (Mandaime) sugar mill in June  and of  workers belonging to the Urban Transport Workers' Trade Union, and the detention of  workers belonging to the Chinandega Banana Industry Trade Union, coffee workers in Matagalpa and two national officials of the CTN, Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo. According to CLAT, the lives of the union officials arrested were also threatened.
.With regard to the allegation that pressure has been brought to bear on the trade union centrals so as to create a single workers' federation, the Government states that the suggestion is totally unfounded since Nicaragua respects pluralism as one of the basic principles of the revolutionary process. The Government adds that it does not interfere in union affairs.
.The Government also states that, according to a report by the competent authority, the only trade unionist arrested in the city of Chinandega was Ciro Paniagua, a member of the CUS, who was held for six days for illegal possession of weapons and released after the responsibilities in the matter had been established.
.Finally, the Government states that some workers were arrested in Matagalpa in February  in connection with the disappearance of some coffee from a plant, but that they were subsequently released.
.With respect to the allegation concerning the Government's intention to create a single workers' federation, the Committee must point out that a similar allegation was made previously in connection with a case which is still pending. The Committee is therefore suspending its consideration of this aspect of the present case until it has examined the substance of the earlier case.
.As to the allegations concerning the arrest of  workers of the Chinandega Banana Industry Trade Union and of coffee workers in Matagalpa, the Committee observes that, as far as the Chinandega workers are concerned, the assertions of the complainants are in direct contradiction with the reply of the Government and that, according to the latter, the workers arrested in Matagalpa were subsequently released. In so far as the complainants do not give any details but simply refer in general terms to repressive measures taken by the Government against the trade union movement without specifying any fundamental anti-union motives for the arrests and without giving any names, the Committee can only recall generally that the detention of trade unionists and workers for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations relating to the dismissal without justifiable cause of  workers at the Javier Guerra (Mandaime) sugar mill in June , the dismissal of  workers belonging to the Urban Transport Workers' Union and the arrest of two national officials of the CTN, Ofilio Garca and Donald Castillo, whose lives have, furthermore, allegedly been threatened. The Committee requests the Government to forward its observations on the matter.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) With regard to the allegations concerning the detention of  workers belonging to the Chinandega Banana Industry Trade union and of coffee workers in Matagalpa, the Committee recalls generally that the detention of trade unionists and workers for activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(b) With regard to the remaining allegations (dismissal without justifiable cause of  workers at the Javier Guerra (Mandaime) sugar mill in June , dismissal of  workers belonging to the urban Transport Workers' Union and the arrest and alleged death threats against two CTN union officials, Ofilio Garcia and Donald Castillo), the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to them and requests it to forward its observations in this connection.",-1,1981,Nicaragua
169,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November  when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government has supplied its observations in communications dated  November and  December  and  April .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After the previous examination of the case by the Committee, the allegations left pending concerned the physical aggression against Carlos Huembes, Secretary-General of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour, as a result of his trade union activities, and the arrest of Enrique Velarde Ortiz, Martha Alvarez and Victor Flores, trade union leaders of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour, apparently as a result of a simple request for a wage increase for workers in the Javier Guerra mill.
.Since the Government had not replied to these allegations, the Committee requested it to send in its observations.
.The Government states that the trade union leaders of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour, Enrique Velarde, Martha Alvarez and Victor Flores, were arrested in order to allow the necessary inquiries to be made into acts of sabotage which had been committed in the Javier Guerra mill and to apportion the responsibilities. The Government adds that these leaders were subsequently released.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements that the leaders of the Nicaraguan Confederation of labour, Enrique Velarde, Martha Alvarez and Victor Flores, were arrested in order to allow the necessary inquiries to be made into acts of sabotage which had been committed in the Javier Guerra mill and to apportion the responsibilities. The Committee also observes that discrepancies exist between the version of the facts given by the complainant and the Government in this matter and that according to the former, the arrests appeared to be connected with wage claims. Be that as it may, the Committee notes that the persons concerned have been released and that - according to the Government's reply - no charges appear to have been made against them. In this respect, the Committee cannot but draw the attention of the Government - as it did during its examination of a similar complaint at its November  Session - to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders without specific criminal charges against them involves restrictions on trade union rights.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has not referred to the allegation concerning the acts of physical aggression against Carlos Huembes, Secretary-General of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour. In this respect, given the fact that the complainant has limited the complaint to a generic allegation that the acts of aggression were a result of the trade union activities carried out by Mr. Carlos Huembes, without providing any supplementary information, the Committee can only point out the importance which it attaches to respect being had for fundamental rights for the protection of the physical integrity of individuals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) As regards the alleged arrest of the trade union leaders of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour, Enrique Velarde, Martha Alvarez and Victor Flores, the Committee notes that these persons have been released and draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders without specific criminal charges against them involves restrictions on trade union rights.(b) As concerns the alleged physical aggression against Carlos Huembes, Secretary-General of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour, the Committee stresses the importance which it attaches to respect being had for fundamental rights for the protection of the physical integrity of individuals.
.The complaint of the world Confederation of Labour (WCL) is contained in a communication dated  March . WCL sent additional information on  April . The Government sent its reply in a communication dated  April .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL alleges that simply as a result of a request for a wage increase which was presented by more than  workers through their trade union organisation, the most elementary rights of the workers at the Javier Guerra Mill were violated and suppressed.
.The complainant adds that the Javier Guerra Mill was attacked by the police and that Santos Martinez Ortiz, Rger Prez and Manuel Guadamuz, trade union leaders of the Mill, were imprisoned along with Enrique Velarde Ortiz, Martha Alvarez and Victor Flores, national officials of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour (CTN). Lastly, the WCL alleges that Carlos Huembes, Secretary General of the CTN, was attacked as a result of his trade union functions.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that after certain workers at the Javier Guerra Mill had committed acts of sabotage aimed at disrupting production at the Mill, various suspects were arrested for questioning, including Messrs. Santos Martinez, Manuel Guadamuz and Rger Prez. After  days of detention, the latter were released on bail by the Managua Court of Appeal.
.The Government also states that Messrs. Santos Martinez and Rger Prez were dismissed from the Javier Guerra Mill because they were suspected of having committed acts of sabotage and because their insufficient work skills had proved detrimental to the Mill's production.
.The Committee notes that discrepancies exist between the accounts of the complainant and the Government concerning the arrest of the trade union officials Santos Martinez, Rger Prez and Manual Guadamuz. According to the complainant, the arrests appeared to be connected with the wage claims presented by the trade union organisation of the Javier Guerra Mill. For the Government, on the other hand, the three trade union officials were suspected of having carried out acts of sabotage against the Mill's production and the arrests were made in order to allow inquiries to be carried out. Be that as it may, the Committee notes that the three trade union officials were freed after  days' detention, following a decision by the Appeals Court to grant bail. In this respect, even if the discrepancies between the statements of the Government and the complainant cannot allow any conclusions to be drawn as to the motives behind the arrests, the Committee must, however, draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the detention of trade unionists without specific criminal charges against them involves restrictions of trade union rights.
.The Committee notes that according to the Government, the trade union officials Santos Martinez and Rger Prez were dismissed from the Javier Guerra Mill because they were suspected of having committed acts of sabotage and because their insufficient work skills were proving detrimental to the production of the Mill. In this connection, the Committee observes that after a period of detention of  days for the purposes of investigating their involvement in acts of sabotage, Santos Martinez and Rger Prez were released by the Appeals Court. The Committee also notes that according to the complainant, the arrests were connected with wage claims presented by the workers. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that it would be in the interests of developing harmonious labour relations if the Government examined to what extent the dismissals were due to the trade union activities of the workers concerned, so that in the event that the dismissals were made for such reasons, measures might be adopted with a view to the reinstatement of these officials in their work places.
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the acts of aggression against Carlos Huembes, Secretary General of the Nicaraguan Confederation of Labour, as a result of his trade union activities, and the arrest of Enrique Velarde Ortiz, Martha Alvarez and Victor Flores, trade union leaders of the Nicaraguan Confederation of labour. The Committee requests the Government to supply its observations on these allegations.",0,1981,Nicaragua
170,".The Committee has examined this case on various occasions (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to ; th Report, paras.  to ; and rd Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th, st and th Sessions in May-June , November  and February-March  respectively), most recently at its May  meeting (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in May-June ), when it presented an interim report. The Government sent certain information by a communication of January .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined the case at its May  meeting it made the following recommendations in respect of the allegation that remained pending (relating to the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of the Managing Board of Private Enterprises (COSEP)):(a) The Committee expresses its surprise at the contradiction between the judgment of  March  (according to which the Vice-President of COSEP, Mr. Jorge Salazar, fired first against the state security patrol and died in the ensuing exchange of fire) and the Government's two communications, dated respectively before and after this judgement (in which it is explicitly and implicitly recognised that Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time of the events); this all the more so since the judgement was only transmitted by the Government nearly two years after being handed down. It urges the Government to explain this contradiction and this delay.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the judgement of  March  is considered final and whether there was a possibility to appeal this decision or whether it was subject to automatic review.
.As regards the contradiction referred to by the Committee in paragraph (a) of the recommendations which it made at its May  meeting, the Government states that the remarks of a government official, even of a minister, cannot be regarded as incontrovertible evidence; still less can they be compared with the legal force of a judgement handed down by a court containing a statement made by one of the principal protagonists in the events concerned. Only those who were present at the place at which the facts occurred can attest to what took place there. According to the Government, Mr. Moncada Lau, Mr. Salazar's chief accomplice, clearly establishes in his statement that the latter was armed and that, out of an instinct of self-preservation (according to the words used by Mr. Moncada Lau himself) he opened fire on the patrol under the impression that it belonged to the State Security Services, undoubtedly motivated by the full knowledge of the offence which he was committing at that moment, namely the illicit transport of arms.
.The Government nevertheless observes that the fact of Mr. Salazar's being armed or unarmed is a detail which it is not for the Committee to examine; this is a penal matter whose constituent elements have to be analysed by the courts of law of the land for the purpose of passing judgement.
.The Government also states that the judgement passed in the case of Mr. Salazar clearly proves that the case involves problems of the country's internal policy, and that a group of individuals led by Jorge Salazar were organising a conspiracy against the Government and its authorities. In no country could Mr. Salazar's activities at that time have been described as activities in defence of occupational interests. To admit that the illicit transport of arms and conspiring against the Government are aims of either workers' or employers' organisations would lead one onto very dangerous ground, would totally vitiate the spirit of Convention No.  and would consequently enable organisations to depart from their basic aims. The Government considers that the facts referred to in no way constitute a violation of its undertakings regarding freedom of association.
.Lastly, in response to the Committee's request for information, the Government states that the possibility of an appeal existed, as was established in the judgement of  March . Nevertheless, since the defendant did not have recourse to this means of redress within the legal time-limit, the judicial authority ruled that the judgement was final; it thus had the authority of a decided case. In any case, the Nicaraguan system does not provide for automatic review before a higher instance.
.The Committee notes that the Government, in its reply of January , fully endorses the version of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, accepted by the judicial authority in its judgement of  March , namely that Mr. Salazar was the first to fire against the state security patrol following which he lost his life. The Committee also observes that the Government gives a contradictory version of the facts originally given by it, according to which Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time the events took place, stating that the comments of a government official, even a minister, cannot be regarded as incontrovertible evidence, still less be compared with the legal force of a judgement handed down by a court.
.As regards the Government's statement that it is not for the Committee to examine whether Mr. Salazar was armed or unarmed, the Committee must stress that an examination of the circumstances surrounding this death is, on the contrary, essential in determining the facts with precision and in reaching a fully informed decision on the allegations made.
.The Committee notes and expresses its surprise that the Government has retracted its statements which had been previously made by the Minister of the Interior, regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar Argello. At the same time it deplores that the Government has not given any reasons for the long delay in sending the judgement of  March  concerning the death of Mr. Salazar, which the Government only transmitted almost two years after it was handed down. In these circumstances the Committee considers that the continuing climate of uncertainty and doubt regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar cannot but have a detrimental influence on labour relations and on the trust which must prevail in occupational organisations if freedom of association is to be exercised.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the possibility of appealing against the judgement of  March  existed, but that since the defendant made no use of this possibility the judgement remained final.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee deplores that the Government has not given any reasons for the long delay in sending the judgement of  March  respecting the death of Mr. Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, which the Government only transmitted almost two years after it was handed down.(b) The Committee notes and expresses it surprise that the Government has retracted its statements previously made by the Minister of the Interior regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar.(c) In these circumstances the Committee considers that the continuing climate of uncertainty and doubt regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar cannot but have detrimental influence on labour relations and on the trust which must prevail among occupational organisations if freedom of association is to be exercised.
.The Committee has examined this case on various occasions [see th Report of the Committee, paras. - and th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th and st Sessions in May-June  and November , respectively]; it last examined this case at its February-March meeting in  [see rd Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in February-March ] at which time it submitted an interim report. The Government submitted some information in a communication dated  February , received by the Office after the Committee's February-March  meeting.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the Committee's most recent examination of the case, the allegation concerning the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of the Managing Board of Private Enterprises (COSEP) remained pending. The Committee made the following recommendation on this matter to the Governing Body: ""The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied the text of the judgment handed down by the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of the employer leader, Salazar Argello, which was handed down some time ago; it urges the Government to transmit its judgment at an early date."" (See rd Report of the Committee, para. .
.In its communication of  February , the Government encloses the text of the judgment handed down by the Military Court of First Instance of the Sandinista Armed Forces on  March , concerning the death",0,1980,Nicaragua
171,"of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello.
.In its judgment, the above-mentioned Court ruled the following:The present case concerning the alleged offence of homicide against Jorge Salazar Argello about whom no details are provided in the present proceedings, with which Javier del Carmen Gonzlez, Garcia, Francisco Javier Rodriguez Daz and Pedro Jos Andino Villalobos are charged, is stayed - all three persons concerned are of age, soldiers in active service, of whom the first is unmarried and the second married, all living in this same locality - since it has been proved that they were fulfilling their duty and acting in observance of a right, authority or duty and, furthermore, acting in legitimate self-defence; it is therefore ruled that these said persons shall be immediately released.
.Amongst the grounds for the judgment were the following:... It would seem from evidence that on  November , at El Crucero, the deceased Salazar Argello met Nstor Omar Moncada Lau with a view to supervising the handing over of some weapons that Salazar was transporting in a Cherokee truck, allegedly his own, so that he might assist criminal actions against the Revolutionary State; it was for this reason that the truck had two sets of number plates, one on top of the other; Salazar Argello and Moncada Lau were involved in this handing over of weapons when they suddenly saw a patrol drawing up in front of the Esso petrol station in El Crucero, where they were carrying out this operation; this patrol was made up of the above-mentioned persons striving to maintain the integrity of our struggle on behalf of the population; immediately fire was opened against the vehicle transporting the said patrol, which was forced to repulse the attack to which it was subjected and, in the exchange of fire, Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello was killed. We have not come upon any evidence whatsoever in this case which might lead this Court to doubt that Moncada Lau and Salazar Argello were the first to start firing against the police patrol; the same Nstor Moncada Lau, who assisted Salazar in his illegal activities, gave added credence to this supposition in his statement to the Military Examining Magistrate, made at . a.m. Friday,  July ; his version of the facts was spontaneously and voluntarily given. He adds that when they were discovered, they were in the process of transferring six M- firearms and an unspecified number of magazines from Salazar Argellos's vehicle to the one that he himself, Moncada Lau, was driving; at the time and place decided upon with Salazar, the latter arrived, parking his Cherokee truck alongside Moncada Lau's Toyota car, behind the ESSO petrol station in the above-mentioned locality, so that their criminal actions might be concealed from the eyes of any onlookers who might discover what was happening. Moncada Lau continues by saying that he had just started transferring the weapons to the Cherokee truck, which Salazar was driving, when a vehicle arrived transporting soldiers, presumably members of the State Security Services; at this moment, Salazar was at the wheel of the Cherokee truck, ready to return to the farm on his estate, which is in the neighbourhood of El Crucero, as soon as the arms had been handed over; his instinct of self-preservation prompted him to pull out the firearm he was carrying, duly loaded, and he started to fire against the state security patrol. The latter, finding itself attacked, was obliged to respond and, in the ensuing exchange of fire, Salazar Argello was killed. This incident, highly regrettable for the suffering it has caused to his family and friends, can only be attributed to the desperate action taken by Moncada Lau and Salazar in their attempt to escape unharmed from the counter-revolutionary activities in which they were involved to try and destroy the Revolutionary State, so that they might regain their lost privileges; this had even led them to try and destroy our system by dealing illegally in weapons and in giving instruction on their use; consequently, the accused Javier del Carmen Rodriguez Garca, Francisco Javier Rodriguez Diaz and Pedro Jos Andino Villalobos were only fulfilling their duty as members of the state security forces and were legally exercising their right as soldiers entrusted with protecting and maintaining law and order both inside and outside the Republic; viewed from this standpoint, their action was perfectly within the provisions pertaining to the exoneration of criminal responsibility laid down in clause  of section  of the Criminal Code, thus making the charge of criminal responsibility inadmissible, since all their actions took place within a justifiable framework.Even supposing that the accused were not fulfilling their duty in repulsing the attacks made upon them by Salazar Argello and Moncada Lau and supposing that they were not exercising any right of authority, even under these circumstances, the fact that they were acting in legitimate self-defence would exonerate them from criminal responsibility; indeed, our Criminal Code stipulates that there should be three requirements, simultaneously concurrent, to qualify for this exoneration and these were all present in the events under consideration. As is well known, in order to have the principle of legitimate defence accepted, it is necessary to prove that there was an illegal assault, that there were reasonable grounds for the means used to prevent or repulse this attack and that there was no provocation on the part of the person defending himself; the statements made by Nstor Omar Moncada Lau himself and Jessi Rojas Snchez prove that these requirements were duly met in the present proceedings and the evidence leaves no doubt that the State Security Services did not attack Salazar and Moncada Lau, but that they merely repulsed the attack to which they were subjected ...
.The Committee notes the contents of the judgment handed down by the Military Court of First Instance of the Sandinista Armed Forces of  March , concerning the death of Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP. The Committee points out that in its previous report on this case, it noted that a military court was dealing with this case under section  of the Act concerning the organisation of military courts and provisional military penal proceedings, which reads as follows. ""The Military Courts shall be responsible for conducting penal proceedings in connection with any punishable act in which a number of the military personnel is implicated, even if one or more of the participants or the victims are civilians"". [See rd Report, para. .]
.In the judgment in question, the Committee notes the staying of the case ""concerning the alleged offence of homicide against Jorge Salazar Argello ... with which Javier del Carmen Gonzlez Garca, Francisco Javier Rodrguez Daza and Pedro Jos Andino Villalobos, soldiers in active service, are charged ... since it has been proved that they were fulfilling their duty and acting in observance of a right, authority or duty and, furthermore, acting in legitimate self-defence.""
.The Committee notes that it appears from the judgment that Mr. Salazar, in order to conceal criminal actions against the Revolutionary State, fired against the patrol vehicle of the state security forces which arrived when Mr. Salazar was transferring firearms (six M- rifles) from his truck to Mr. Moncada Lau's car; the members of the patrol repulsed this attack, killing Mr. Salazar in the exchange of fire which ensued. These events occurred on  November , in front of the Esso petrol station at El Crucero.
.The Committee notes that the judicial military authorities concluded that there were grounds justifying the soldiers' action in killing Mr. Salazar, especially in view of the fact that the latter has started the exchange of fire, and that this was corroborated by the version of the events given by Mr. Moncada Lau, the person accompanying Mr. Salazar at the time of his death.
.Nevertheless, the Committee would point out that, in its communication of  December , the Government stated that ""it is not certain that Mr. Salazar died as a result of an ambush set by the police. He was killed when he was about to be captured with his companion, who shot first with a firearm at the authorities who were proceeding to arrest him; thus an exchange of fire was started resulting, unfortunately, in the death of Mr. Salazar Argello ..."".It also notes that, in its communication of  September  (received by the ILO on  October ), the Government stated that ""even if it was certain that Jorge Salazar was unarmed at the time of the events - as was admitted by Commander Toms Borge - the truth is that six M- automatic weapons were in his truck which were intended for Moncada Lau ..."".
.In view of the contradiction between the judgment of the Military Court of First Instance of the Sandinista Armed Forces of  March  (according to which Mr. Salazar opened the exchange of fire) and the above-mentioned communications from the Government (in which it both implicitly and explicitly recognised that Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time of",0,1980,Nicaragua
172,"the events) one of which is dated before and the other after the judgment, the Committee must express its surprise at this discrepancy and urge the Government to explain this. The Committee considers that this is all the more important in view of the fact that the judgment of  March  was only transmitted with a communication dated  February , i.e. almost two years after being handed down.
.So as to be in a position to reach conclusions on the outstanding allegation in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the judgment of  March  is considered as final and whether there was a possibility to appeal this decision, or whether it was subject to automatic review
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee expresses its surprise at the contradiction between the judgment of  March  (according to which the Vice-President of COSEP, Mr. Jorge Salazar fired first against the state security patrol and died in the ensuing exchange of fire) and the Government's two communications dated, respectively, before and after this judgment (in which it is explicitly and implicitly recognised that Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time of the events) ; this all the more so since the judgment was only transmitted by the Government nearly two years after being handed down. It urges the Government to explain this contradiction and this delay.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the judgment of  March  is considered as final and whether there was a possibility to, appeal this decision, or whether it was subject to automatic review.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following recommendations:
.General recommendations(a) The Committee appreciates the spirit of co-operation that the Government has demonstrated by accepting that the Director-General's representative, during the direct contacts mission, could examine with the authorities the various aspects of the cases which were still pending and seek further information on them. The Committee observes that, thanks to the information obtained by the Director-General's representative, it has been able to examine a substantial number of the allegations to which the Government had not replied. However, the Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied detailed information on certain outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the statement made by the Deputy Minister concerning the content of the complaints the Committee recalls that even if, in certain instances, the allegations have lacked some precision, it is required to examine them in all objectivity and to seek to obtain a maximum of information concerning them.(c) The Committee wishes to express its serious concern at the large number of leaders and members of workers' and employers' organisations who have been arrested. The Committee considers that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights and in particular, the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, are fully respected and guaranteed.(d) The Committee observes from its examination of certain allegations and of the information supplied by the Government and from the mission report that acts of hostility between union organisations or within individual organisations occur rather frequently. The Committee considers that freedom of association implies the right of workers' and employers' organisations to resolve any difficulties by themselves, and without interference by the authorities; the Committee also considers that it is for the Government to create an atmosphere conducive to the resolution of such difficulties.
.Recommendations as to individual casesCase No. (a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied the text of the judgment handed down by the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of employer leader Salazar Argello which was handed down some time ago; it urges the Government to transmit this judgment at an early date.(b) The Committee notes with interest that the public prosecutor aid not bring any penal charges against certain employer leaders for offences against the security of the State and other offences. The Committee would recall that the preventive detention of leaders of workers' or employers' organisations for activities connected with the exercise of their rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) As regards the composition of the Council of State, the Committee considers that participation of workers' and employers' organisations in the Council should imply the strict application of criteria on the basis of which the representativity of these organisations may be determined; moreover, the participation of these organisations in the Council should not deprive other organisations of their right to defend the interests of their members.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take up the suggestion of the Director-General's representative that the Ministry responsible for agrarian reform should obtain further information and be informed of the allegations that members of the CTN have been physically attacked by the authorities on state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations and that sugar workers affiliated to the CTN have been prevented from entering their work centres; the Committee also requests the complainant to transmit any further information it may have concerning this matter.(b) The Committee requests the Government to call for an investigation of the alleged threats by official militias against the lives of trade union leaders (specifically, Luis Mora and Salvador Snchez) and to keep it informed of its findings.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has been recommending trade union organisations to join the Sandinista Central of Workers (CST) and that copies of the by-laws of trade union organisations, on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead, have been deposited at the headquarters of the CST so that it can register the recently constituted organisations among its members.(b) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that SEEOMC leader Alejandro Arnuero, who was to take part in a congress of the International Transport Workers' Federation in Brazil, had his passport withdrawn without any valid reason. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the final decision handed down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgment handed down on the granting of legal personality to the trade union of workers in various undertakings in the sugar sector (""Faustino Martinez"" and others) so that it can reach conclusions on the allegations with all relevant information at its disposal.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the searching of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the use of aggression against its leaders.(f) The Committee regrets that the Government has not indicated the precise grounds for the arrest of a number of trade unionists who have now been released but merely gives the name o the Act that they are said to have contravened; it again requests the Government to transmit information on this matter.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the information passed on by the CTN to the Director-General's representative concerning seven trade unionists who, contrary to the claims of the Government, are allegedly still in custody.The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations concerning arrests to which it has not replied, involving  union leaders or members.(h) In general terms, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures designed to deprive persons of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(i) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations that rural workers of WASACA affiliated to the CTN have been interrogated and threatened with imprisonment and that Eugenio Membreo and other members of the CTN executive committee have been threatened and intimidated in their homes. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(j) The Committee considers that no further examination need be made of the allegations relating to the coercion of Denis Maltes; the persecution and harassment of Zacaras Hernndez and Isabel Somarriba; the interference in the SEEOMC meeting on  December ; the detention of  trade union leaders and members of SEEOMC; and the physical attacks and threats against leaders of the CUS due to the SEEOMC meeting called for  May .Case No. (a) The Committee notes with interest that the General Labour Inspectorate has ordered the reinstatement of eight trade unionists employed by ENABUS who, according to the complainants, were dismissed for being members of an organisation affiliated to the CTN.(b) The Committee requests the complainants to send further details regarding the alleged destruction of the premises of the rural workers' union in Rio Grande and Las",0,1980,Nicaragua
173,"Mojarras (Department of Len) and to indicate exactly in which locality the five leaders of the Union of Workers of the Hacienda El Progreso were dismissed on  January  and prevented from returning to work despite a court order to reinstate them (according to the Government, there are over a hundred plantations under the name of ""El Progreso"").(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied, involving the union leader Hermgenes Aguirre Largaespada and trade unionist Larry Lee Shoures and the arrest of trade unionist Abelino Gonzlez, Piz.Case No. (a) Since there is no record of any charges having been brought against the persons concerned, the Committee regrets that four union leaders should have been held in custody for a long time and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the preventive detention of union leaders entails a serious risk of interference in the activities of trade union organisations.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Salomn Daz Fernndez is being held for counter-revolutionary activities and requests the Government to indicate whether he is still in custody and to specify the precise charges brought against him.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in may  and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Subsequently, the complainant sent additional information in communications dated  October and  November . The Government replied in communications of October and  December  and  October . In accordance with the procedure in force, in view of the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's observations contained in its communication of October , these observations were sent to the complainant organisation for its comments. The comments thus received were forwarded to the Government.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.  ).
.As regards the allegation concerning the death of Jorge Salazar Argello, vice-President of COSEP, the Committee takes note of the statements of the complainant and of the Government, and of the judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice of  October . The Committee notes in particular that the above-mentioned judgement states that ""court records show that a criminal court is investigating the persons responsible for his death; the case had originally been investigated by a criminal tribunal and was taken over by the military court because of the military status of the persons responsible"". Therefore, in keeping with its previous conclusions, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgement of the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello. The Committee also requests the Government to indicate in virtue of what legal text a military court was dealing with this matter.
.As regards the allegation concerning the arrests and prison sentences of enterprise managers, the Committee observes that the Court of Appeal quashed the verdict of guilty pronounced by the court of first instance on Francisco Castillo Molina and handed down a conditional sentence on Gabriel Lacayo Benard for a probation period of two years, requiring him to submit a mortgage guarantee to the Treasury and ordering him to be on good behaviour. The Committee notes in addition that the Supreme Court of Justice on  October  closed the case definitively in favour of the accused Dora Maria Lau de Lacayo, Leonardo Ramn Somarriba Gonzlez, Alejandro Jos Salazar Elizondo, Mario Hannon Talavera and Luis Adolfo Valle Lau, charged with crimes against the Act on preservation of order and public security. The Committee notes also that the judgement orders the first criminal tribunal of Managua to institute criminal proceedings for the crimes against the internal security of the State, conspiracy and other resulting crimes against all those whose cases have been closed, since there are sufficient presumptions, clues and investigations to lead to the conclusion that acts constituting such crimes may exist. In these circumstances, the Committee can only ask the Government to send the text of the decision handed down on the case by the first criminal tribunal of Managua.
.As regards the allegation concerning the Bill on trade union associations, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this Bill was drawn up privately by an official of the Ministry of Labour, who handed copies to some persons for their opinion, and therefore was not an official Bill. In this respect, taking account of the Government's statements and considering that since the complainant formulated this allegation ( January ) the Bill in question does not appear to have reached the competent authorities for adoption, the Committee considers that this allegation does not require further examination.
.With respect to the violations of freedom of information, the Committee observes that the complainant referred to Decree No. , to a communiqu of the Ministry of the Interior ordering that before disseminating news about the armed confrontation in which Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello was killed, the sources stipulated in Decree No.  must be consulted, and to the closure on five occasions of the newspaper ""La Prensa"", which frequently echoes the views expressed by COSEP.
.As regards Decree No. , although it takes note of the Government's statements thereon and observes that the Decree is applied generally and not exclusively to the trade union field, the Committee considers that its application to the dissemination of news concerning the armed confrontation in which Mr. Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, was killed - as well as the retaliatory measures taken against the newspaper ""La Prensa"" for having reported this - have restricted the exercise of trade union rights. , The Committee so considers because it has pointed out on previous occasions that the publication and distribution of news and information of trade union interest constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures for their control may involve a serious interference by the administrative authorities. The Committee also points out to the Government the importance which it attaches to the Resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th () Session.
.Concerning the efforts of the National Sandinista Liberation Front (FSLN), supported by the Government, to divide COSEP, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the Government does not allow pluralism to develop within employers' organisations, but sets up its own organisations dependent on it, as is shown by FSLN interference by promoting parallel pseudo-official organisations which it attempts to substitute for the organisations of the private sector. According to the complainant, this was the case of the Confederation of Occupational Associations, Heroes and Martyrs (APHM) and of the National Association of Agriculturists and Stock-breeders (ANAL): the former had taken away a seat in the council of State from the (independent) Confederation of Occupational Associations, which groups together most of Nicaragua's professional workers; the latter had been given two seats in the Council of State, despite the fact that the organisation which truly represents the agricultural and fishery sector is the Union of Agricultural and Fishery Producers. The Committee also takes note of the Government's statements that trade union pluralism is one of the principles of the Revolution and its denial that the Government attempts to divide COSEP, although priority is given to the task of organising co-operatives, collectives, etc., in the sectors which previously did not enjoy the benefits of economic activity. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegation concerning interference of the FSLN by promoting parallel pseudo-official organisations (CAPHM and ANAL, for example) which had taken away seats in the Council of State from organisations of the private sector. The Committee therefore asks the Government to send its observations on this matter.
.Concerning the preliminary draft of the law on professional activities, having analysed its provisions the Committee considers that this preliminary draft regulates questions which lie outside the scope of Conventions on freedom of association, as it confines itself to regulating access to the various occupations listed, the exercise of these occupations and the organisations and bodies competent in these matters. The Committee notes further that, to judge from the Government's statements and from the preamble to the text of the preliminary draft sent by the complainant, this preliminary draft is undergoing a phase of consultations between the persons and organisations directly involved. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.Lastly, concerning pressure on independent trade unions to destroy them and force them to join a single trade union confederation, the Committee observes that, although the complainant referred to discrimination, violent attacks on trade union leaders, assaults on trade union confederation premises and against trade union meetings, it has not cited any specific cases of such violations of freedom. Therefore, taking account of the fact that the Government has denied such allegations, the Committee considers that they do not call for",1,1980,Nicaragua
174,"further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) Concerning the death of Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgement of the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of this employer leader, and to indicate in virtue of what legal text a military court was dealing with this matter.(b) As regards the allegation concerning the arrest and prison sentences of employer leaders:(i) the Committee notes that the Court of Appeal has quashed the verdict of guilty pronounced by the court of first instance against Francisco Castillo Molina and handed down a conditional sentence on Gabriel Lacayo Benard for a probation period of two years;(ii) the Committee notes also that the Supreme Court of Justice has closed the cases of the rest of the accused charged with crimes against the Act on preservation of order and public security, who were tried by courts of the first and second instance. However, the Supreme Court of Justice has ordered the court of first instance to institute criminal proceedings for crimes against the security of the State and other crimes. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgement handed down on this matter by the court of first instance.(c) Concerning the violations of freedom of information, the Committee considers that the application of Decree No.  to the dissemination of news concerning the armed confrontation in which Mr. Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, was killed - as well as the retaliatory measures taken against the newspaper ""La Prensa"" which reported this - have restricted the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the publication and distribution of news and information of trade union interest constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures for their control may constitute a serious interference by the administrative authorities. The Committee also points out to the Government the importance it attaches to the Resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th () Session.(d) Concerning the efforts of the FSLN, supported by the Government, to divide COSEP, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegation concerning FSLN interference by promoting parallel pseudo-official organisations (CAPHM and ANAL) which took away seats in the Council of State from organisations of the private sector. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter.(e) Concerning the rest of the allegations, the Committee considers that they do not require further examination.
.By a communication dated  November , the international Organisation of Employers presented its complaint, and sent additional information on  January . The Government furnished its observations on  November  and on  January .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) alleges that on  November , Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of the Managing Board of Private Enterprises (COSEP), while unarmed, was shot down by the police during an ambush, a few moments after presiding over a meeting of COSEP. According to the complainant, which categorises this event as murder, no serious argument has been advanced in support of the accusations made by the Government against Mr. Salazar (transporting of weapons, membership in an insurgent movement whose aim was to re-establish the Somoza regime, and procurement of aid from abroad for this purpose).
.Whilst referring to violations in Nicaragua of civil liberties which are essential for the exercise of trade union rights, the complainant gives particular emphasis to the events relating to the death of Mr. Salazar. According to the complainant, the right to a fair trial before an independent judicial body was not applied in Mr. Salazar's case; for instance, the court which convicted eight alleged members of participating in a counterrevolutionary plot, and absolved others, decided to ""close definitively the case in favour of Jorge Salazar Argello because of his death"", without resolving either the doubt over what really happened on  November , or the question of his leadership of the plot. The alleged proofs come from statements of journalists and detainees (the latter obtained in prison), from verbal testimony by one member of the police, and from written testimony by a civil servant who did not appear at the trial.
.With reference to the exercise of free speech, the complainant argues further that the Government had decided that the murder of Mr. Salazar was to be categorised as having occurred during ""an armed conflict"" and could not be reported by any media (press, radio, etc.), without a prior veracity check by government services as provided for in Decree No.  of  September .
.In its communication of  November  the International Organisation of Employers cites the imprisonment of various leaders of private enterprises. The IOE indicates that the arrests and detentions which occurred after the change of regime have not ceased, and that section  of the Decree on Rights and Guarantees of the Nicaraguans denies the right of habeas corpus for certain crimes (""alleged or real crimes committed during the Somoza period"").
.The IOE also alleges that the Government tolerates and favours the pressure brought by the FSLN (National Sandinista Liberation Front) to force the major independent trade unions to join the single central trade union. The IOE refers, in an appendix, to the provisions of draft labour law on professional associations, which would establish that trade union policy should be oriented towards avoiding the proliferation of trade union organisations; prohibit the formation of other trade unions if there already existed one in a particular industry or economic activity; establish a Single Central organisation of workers for urban workers and rural workers; and would establish trade unions only for workers, whereas Convention No.  also guarantees to employers the right of association.
.As far as the employers and independent professions are concerned, the IOE alleges that the FSLN, with the Government's support, is trying to divide up the COSEP in organising small and medium-sized undertakings, and is doing the same with independent professions. In particular, the IOE points out that the preliminary draft of the law on regulation of professional activities (proposed by the FSLN and published jointly by the Government and the FSLN) confers extremely wide powers on the bodies which would be created (National Council of Professions and National Confederation of National Associations), and thus limits the freedom of action of those engaged in independent professions. According to the IOE, the Government is hostile towards COSEP and its members.
.Finally, the IOE alleges that under Decree No.  of  September , the negotiation and approval of collective agreements require the Ministry of Labour's approval.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the death of Mr. Salazar is in no way related to the fact that he was the Vice-President of COSEP, and his death could not be considered as murder without the elements of premeditation, treason or profit, and it should also not be qualified as homicide since his death resulted from an armed conflict between the members of the Security Services of the State and an armed group of which he was a member and which was conspiring against the Government.
.The Government adds that the death of Mr. Salazar cannot be considered as a violation of Convention No. , which was plainly demonstrated by the statements of witnesses and of detainees. These persons had confessed to planning a coup d'tat and to conspiracy plans which they tried to carry out in co-ordination with some members of the former Somoza Guard. The Government further argues that Mr. Salazar's activities could in no way be regarded as trade union activities, since they were obviously conspiratorial and constituted a crime against the security of the State.
.The Government states that the detainees could in no way be considered trade union leaders, as the IOE claims, and that these persons did not belong to any trade union (even if this were possible in Nicaragua there are no employers' professional associations, but only organisations formed and regulated by the Civil Code). These persons were conspiring against peace, the security of the State and the life of government officials.
.Consequently the Government rejects the accusations of violation of Convention No.  and of murder.
.The Government sent a copy of the indictment and the text of the judgement (presently under appeal), as well as a copy of the statements to the judicial authorities and to the police linking the following persons to conspiratorial activities aiming at the overthrow of the Government and assassination of government officials: Jorge Salazar, Dora Maria Lau de Lacayo, Leonardo Ramn Sommarriba, Alejandro Salazar Elizondo, Nestor Moncada Lau, Luis Adolfo Valle Lau, Mario Hannon Talavera,",0,1980,Nicaragua
175,"Jaime Francisco Castillo and Gabriel Lacayo Benard.
.Before treating the questions raised by the complainant, the Committee wishes to express its concern over the gravity of certain allegations related to the death of a leader of COSEP, which the Committee profoundly deplores, and to the arrest of several employers who are leaders of private undertakings.
.In the Committee's opinion, the fact that the COSEP does not have the status of a trade union organisation in the eyes of the Nicaraguan legislation does not dispense the Government from the obligations arising from its ratification of Convention No. , in particular, to respect the freedom of the employers in Nicaragua to establish organisations of their own choosing, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes without interference from the public authorities which would restrict this.
.The Committee notes the information submitted by the Government as regards Mr. Salazar, and in particular the fact that the First Criminal Tribunal of Managua ""definitely closes the case in favour of Mr. Salazar because of his death"". The Committee nevertheless notes that the Government in its communication accuses Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello of having conspired against the Government in an armed group. It also observes that if such information refers to the alleged conspiratorial activities, it does not contain sufficient details regarding the motives and circumstances of the activities carried out by the police which resulted in the death of Mr. Salazar, in relation to which, according to the information available to the Committee, the Government has formally admitted that he was not armed at that moment. In this respect, the Committee notes that the report of the interrogation by the public prosecutor of the Assistant Director of the State Security Services does not contain a reply to question No.  concerning the circumstances of Mr. Salazar's death. The Committee also notes that the text of the decision sent by the Government does make a reference to the judicial proceedings carried out by the Second Criminal Tribunal to investigate Mr. Salazar's death, which includes testimony regarding his death, but the Committee has not received a report of these proceedings. In these circumstances the Committee, as it has done on previous occasions in considering allegations relating to death of trade unionists, can only urgently request the Government, if it has not done so already, to undertake as soon as possible an independent judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to communicate the results of this inquiry.
.In reference to arrests and detentions of the other leaders, the Committee has examined the text of the Court's decisions depriving them of their liberty for different time periods for their participation in conspiratorial activities, and it has also noted that they have already appealed. The Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judicial decision of the appeal, so that it can take a decision on the allegations with full knowledge of the facts.
.As regards Decree No.  of  September , which requires approval of collective bargaining agreements by the ministry of Labour, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the requirement of approval or acknowledgement by a government authority to make an agreement valid is not in full conformity with the principle- of voluntary collective bargaining, established under Convention No. . In similar cases, the Committee has recommended the establishment of procedures such as the creation of consultative bodies, designed to ensure that the parties to collective bargaining have regard voluntarily in their negotiations to considerations relating to the economic or social policies of the Government, and the safeguarding of national interests, which in any case should utilise persuasion and not entail recourse to measures of compulsion, while conserving the freedom of both parties as regards the final decision.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the draft labour law on trade unions; and to the alleged FSLN pressures on the major independent trade unions to force them to join a single trade union; and to the limitation on freedom of information by prohibiting the publication of information on the death of Mr. Salazar Argello; the alleged efforts of the FSLN, with the Government's support, to divide up the COSEP; the preliminary draft of the law on regulation of professional activity and the hostility of the Government towards COSEP and its members. The Committee asks the Government to send it information regarding these allegations.",0,1980,Nicaragua

.Cases Nos.  and  concern various allegations which the Committee decided to classify under four headings in order to facilitate its examination of these cases.Allegations relating to measures taken against the CTN
.The complainants alleged that the headquarters of the Nicaraguan Central of Workers (CTN) had been raided by military and security forces and that a number of its leaders had been arrested and ill-treated while others had disappeared. The Government replied to these allegations by stating that no registered workers, association existed with the name of Nicaraguan Central of Workers. Referring to the reasons for the arrest of Messrs. Huembes and Velarde, mentioned by the complainants, the Government stated that their arrest was unconnected with their trade union activities, but related to other activities constituting a threat to the security of the State and a breach of the peace.
.At its May-June  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to furnish information as to the reasons for the raid on the CTN's headquarters as well as details of the specific acts of which Messrs. Huembes and Velarde had been accused, and in particular the nature of the material found in their possession.Allegations relating to the death of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores
.The complainants alleged that Mr. Luis Medrano Flores, General Secretary of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, had been killed on  January  while distributing leaflets announcing a demonstration. The complainants claimed that the murder had been committed by members of a patrol frequently seen around district police station XIII, who were not in uniform and were travelling in a private can The Government replied that Mario Jos Prez Rodrguez had been identified as the killer of Mr. Medrano Flores and placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities, which had issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Prez Rodrguez and two persons who had been with him. The Government supplied the text of this arrest warrant.
.At its May-June  Session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, expressed its concern over this murder and requested the Government to keep it informed as to the outcome of the legal proceedings initiated against the presumed murderer and his accomplices, and to supply the text of the judgement when it was pronounced, together with the reasons adduced therefore.Other allegations
.The complainants alleged that the home of Mr. Mariano Mendoza, Industrial Disputes Secretary of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, had been raided by members of the National Guard, who had arrested one of his sons, and that Mr. Domingo Snchez Salgado, an official of the Nicaraguan General Confederation of Workers, had been arrested by the police. The Government replied that no repression was exercised against any trade union organisation or its members, and that it would supply further information when it received the reports it had requested from the competent authorities.
.When it last examined the case the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government for additional information on these allegations, and in particular on the alleged arrest of Mr. Snchez Salgado.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the raiding of the CTN's headquarters and the arrest of officials of that organisation, the Committee notes with interest the communication from the new Government and the statement by the CTN officials in question that they are at liberty and performing their trade union functions. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination. The same remark may be applied to the fresh allegations made by the CLAT, which also refer to the events involving the CTN.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the killing of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores, the Committee notes the information provided by the present Government. It feels bound to recall in general terms that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the killing of Luis Medrano Flores constitutes a serious impediment to the exercise of individual rights, and that accordingly such acts warrant the taking of severe measures by the authorities. In the present case, bearing in mind the developments that have taken place in the country since the complaints were presented, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee observes that the Government's communication makes no reference to the allegations mentioned in paragraph  of this report.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the raiding of the CTN's headquarters, the arrest of officials of that organisation and the death of Mr. Luis Medrano Flores, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to inform the Committee as to the present situation of the on of Mr. Mariano Mendoza, an official of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, and of Mr. Domingo Snchez Salgado, an official of the Nicaraguan General Confederation of Workers, who according to the complainants were arrested in .

.In a joint communication of  May , the world Confederation of Labour and the Latin American Central of Workers presented a complaint concerning the violation of trade union rights in Nicaragua.
.The text of the above communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a letter of  July .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint relates to the Union of Agricultural Workers of Nueva Segovia (UTC) which, according to the complainant organisations, is affiliated to the Central of Workers of Nicaragua (CTN) and comprises over  communities and organisations of rural workers in the region.
.In their communication, the complainants alleged that members of the national army had prevented the holding of a meeting of the Council of first-degree organisations of the UTC which had been convened for  and  December  near Jalapa, in the department of Nueva Segovia.
.The complainants stated that, in the early hours of  December , the home of a member of the UTC, where Adolfo Bonilla, General Secretary of the Central of Workers of Nicaragua, was staying, was broken into and that Bonilla, who was due to take part in the meeting scheduled for the same day, was arbitrarily and illegally arrested along with two other persons.
.The complainants added that, while the General Secretary of the CTN was being taken to a place of detention in the locality, other members of the armed forces arrested UTC leaders, among whom were Cstulo Lpez, chairman; Venancio Blandn, comptroller; Francisco Cceres, secretary for training; Mximo Zeledn, secretary for co-operatives; Vicente Garcia, member; and two members of the CTN Executive, Carlos Huembes and Ofilio Garcia. All of them were locked up in two detention centres (Jalapa and Ocotal) and subjected to physical and psychological torture for two days, during which the leaders of the UTC and CTN were ordered to cease their trade union activities in the region on pain of death.
.Following action taken by the Legal Department of the CTN, the detained leaders were released on  December, after their heads had been shaved and the national leaders had been threatened with the consequences if they ever returned to the region. Despite their rapid release, Mximo Zeledn, Vicente Garcia and Matas Talavera had to undergo medical and hospital treatment as a result of their maltreatment by the police. Consequently, the meeting of the Council of the UTC could not be held, which, stated the complainants, was in line with the Government's objectives.
.In conclusion, the CLAT and the WCL requested that a number of measures should be taken, including the sending of a fact-finding Committee, and that the right of workers to organise freely should be respected.
.In its reply, the Government stated that the allegations submitted by the complainant organisation were false, premeditated and more of a political than a trade union nature. The Government added that no organisation by the name of Central of Workers of Nicaragua or Union of Agricultural Workers of Nueva Segovia was registered either at the Department of Trade Union Organisations or at the Department of Co-operatives of the Ministry of Labour. The situation was the same as regards the communities and organisations of rural workers said to be affiliated to the UTC.
.By way of evidence, the Government attached to its communication various documents, including the list of federations and Confederations registered with the Department of Trade Union Organisations of the Ministry of Labour, and the list of organisations and associations of the Department of Nueva Segovia. With reference to the allegations concerning the Secretary for Cooperatives of the UTC, the Government stated that no co-operative or any other grouping of this name or of that of the CTN was listed on the Ministry's files.
.The Government also attached a cutting from the newspaper La Prensa, of  December , containing the minimum programme of the Democratic Union for Liberation (UDEL), a political opposition movement in which the Central of Workers of Nicaragua participates. Among the signatories of this programme, in their capacity as representatives of the CTN, are Adolfo Bonilla and Carlos Huembes, both of whom are mentioned in the complaint.
.In conclusion, the Government stated that it had never ceased to apply the ILO Conventions which it has ratified, in particular Convention No. .
.Generally speaking, the Committee has always considered that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights' and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee considers that the detention of trade union leaders with the aim of preventing the holding of a union meeting constitutes a serious violation of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee likewise considers that, during their detention, trade unionists, like anyone else, should benefit from the guarantees provided for under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Committee has also expressed the view that the detention by authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that the Government merely indicates that the two organisations to which the arrested leaders belonged are not registered with the Ministry of Labour and that the Central of Workers of Nicaragua participates in a political opposition movement. The Government adds, however, that two of the leaders concerned have signed the programme of this political movement in the name of the CTN. The Committee considers it relevant to recall that if, in certain instances, it has concluded that a complaint does not call for further examination, this was only after it had received information from the Government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measure of detention was in no way occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. In the present case, the Government gives no details of the reasons justifying the arrest of the trade unionists or of the allegations of maltreatment inflicted on the detainees.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to request the Government to supply information on the reasons justifying the arrest of the persons concerned;(c) to request the Government to forward its observations on the allegations concerning the maltreatment alleged to have been inflicted on the detainees;(d) to transmit the substance of the Government's reply to the complainant organisations to enable them to forward their observations and, in particular, to furnish details regarding the situation of the Central of Workers of Nicaragua and the Union of Agricultural Workers which, according to the",0,1976,Nicaragua

.The allegations still outstanding concern the arrest, in August , of Messrs. Julio Guardin, Ofilio Garcia, Antonio Centeno and Francisco Palacios, leaders of the Textile Workers' Union, at the time when a general strike was started in the textile industry. According to the WCL, these persons were still in detention in November  without any specific charge having been brought against them, and it was not known what authority had ordered and maintained their detention. The Government having submitted no information on this aspect of the case, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, at its November  session, to request the Government to indicate as soon as possible the situation concerning the trade union leaders arrested, to state whether they had appeared before a court and, if so, to supply the text of the court findings and the reasons given therefor.
.In this connection the Government stated in its communication of  December  that it was the legal advisers of the firm of Fabritex who, in , had denounced directly to the criminal judiciary the activities of certain persons who, according to the Government, could not be qualified as trade union leaders. It added that the case in question was closed and that it ""understood"" that these persons had been set at liberty long ago.
.At its session in February , the Committee decided to transmit to the complainant organisation the substance of the Government's observations and to invite it to make any comments it wished thereon, on the understanding that the Government would have the opportunity to reply to these comments.
.In a communication dated  June , the WCL confirmed that the persons named in the complaint were no longer in custody. The WCL stated that they had been arrested on the occasion of a general strike called in the textile industry in August . There was absolutely no doubt, continued the complainants, that the leaders of the Textile Workers' Union had spent many long months in prison, and that they had been detained on account of their trade union activities.
.The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which has not furnished any observations upon it.
.The Committee notes that the persons named in the complaint were released long ago. It must observe, however, that the statements of the complainants and of the Government as to the grounds for their arrest are contradictory: according to the WCL, the measures in question were connected with their trade union activities, whereas according to the Government, these persons cannot be qualified as trade union leaders.
.The Committee notes that the persons named in the complaint and claimed by the WCL to be trade union leaders were arrested on the occasion of a general strike in the textile industry. It notes that the Government has given no reasons as to why it considers that these persons are not trade union leaders. The Committee considers that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures taken did not arise out of the trade union activities of the persons in question. In this connection the Committee regrets that the Government has provided no information concerning the legal proceedings instituted against these persons, nor has it furnished the text of the court findings, as requested by the Committee.
.Subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph , and bearing in mind that the persons named were released long ago, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint from the World Confederation of Labour was submitted in a letter of  November . In view of the fact that, despite repeated requests, the Government had not communicated its observations on the complaint, the Committee sent urgent, requests to the Government, in February and in May , to provide the information requested. The Government's observations were received in a communication of  July .

The case concerned, in particular, the right to establish federations and the control of trade union funds by the administrative authorities.
.By a communication dated  May  the Government made certain observations on the conclusions reached by the Committee In the light of these observations the Committee re-examined the case as a whole at its November  session and submitted a further report containing definitive conclusions in which it repeated the remarks it had made previously. This review of the case is to be found in the Committee's rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The Government sent a further communication on  February  in which it made observations on the conclusions set forth by the Committee in its rd Report. Having examined these observations, the Committee is of the opinion that they contain nothing which would lead it to modify its earlier conclusions, and for this reason it recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meeting in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body a final report, to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.By a communication dated  May , the Government made certain observations on the conclusions reached by the Committee in this case.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its general conclusions with regard to the case, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, inter alia:(c) with regard to the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the legislation in force is incompatible with the right of trade unions to establish federations of their own choosing;(d) with regard to the allegation that the Ministry of Labour seized control of the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, to draw the Government's attention to the principle that control over the internal acts of a trade union should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, or by a person who enjoys some degree of independence of the administrative authorities and who is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities, and to point out that the authorisation still required by the Teachers' Union of Managua to draw on its bank accounts runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities;(e) with regard to the allegation concerning interference by the authorities in the establishment of new unions, to draw the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom;
.As concerns the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the Government had stated previously that this organisation had been guilty of breaches of the Trade Union Regulations, and that, in particular, it was composed of unions from different departments, thus contravening the provisions of section  of the Regulations, which provides that trade unions from different departments may not form a federation. The Committee had expressed the view that such a provision constituted a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to establish federations and Confederations, recognised by Article  of Convention No..In this connection, the Committee recalled the importance that should be attached to the principle laid down in Article  of Convention No.  that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing, a principle that implies for the organisations themselves the right to establish and join federations and Confederations of their own choosing (Articles  and  of the Convention). The Committee therefore considered that conditions laid down by law for the organisation of federations were incompatible with these standards, which include the right of trade unions to form such federations as they see fit.
.In its new communication the Government maintains that the aforementioned provision of the Trade Union Regulations owes its existence to the fact that organisations are the product of mutual and identical interests arising from the close connection of these organisations. On the other hand, even between persons having the same trade or occupation, their problems differ depending on the geographical location of their work. Section  of the Regulations is extremely conducive to the orderly establishment of federations, which cannot in some cases reconcile divergences between trade unions. The Government further points out that the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation has likewise failed to carry out certain formalities required under section  of the Regulations and accordingly cannot claim that it is lawfully constituted under the terms of the law.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's explanations, and is of the opinion that there is no infringement of the principles of freedom of association if trade union organisations are obliged to comply with certain purely formal requirements laid down by law with respect to their Constitution. Nevertheless, as concerns requirements of substance, the Committee must re-emphasise its earlier observation to the effect that section  of the Regulations is not compatible with the terms of Convention No. , in terms of which trade unions should have the right to form such federations as they see fit, even if these federations comprise trade unions relating to different activities or in different districts.
.With regard to the control of the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, the Government had referred in its first communication to the discovery by the labour authorities of certain irregularities in the management of these funds, as a result of which the Department of Associations had ordered that no withdrawals should be made from the Union's bank account unless the cheques were first endorsed by the Head of that Department. In its new communication the Government claims, in reply to the Committee's observation concerning the nature of this control, that it is inadmissible to doubt the honesty of the administrative authorities or to assume that it acted in bad faith. The Government further declares that the Union accepted the action taken by the Department, since it did not avail itself of its Constitutional right to apply for an injunction, and that accordingly it failed to exhaust the remedies provided for by Nicaraguan law.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's comments, and considers it pertinent to point out that it is important that control over the internal acts of a trade union should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority not only in order to ensure that it is exercised in an impartial and objective manner but also to avoid the risk of measures Of control taken by the administrative authorities appearing to be arbitrary. Furthermore, the Committee considers it necessary to re-emphasise its earlier observation to the effect that the authorisation still required by the Teachers' Union of Managua to draw on its bank accounts runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities.
.Lastly, as concerns the allegation relating to interference by the authorities in the establishment of new unions, concerning which the Government had failed to make any observations, the Committee takes note of the statement made by the Government in its new communication to the effect that no interference in fact occurred, but that, on the other hand, teachers who differed with the line of action taken by the Federation undertook spontaneously and on their own initiative to set up other organisations which they felt would be better fitted to defend their interests.
.In these circumstances, and as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's observations with respect to the conclusions reached previously in regard to this case, and to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph , above concerning the Constitution of federations and in paragraph  above concerning the control and management of trade union funds.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March  addressed direct to the Director-General of the ILO by the World Federation of Trade Unions. The complaint was communicated to the Government for observations by a letter dated  March  and these were received in a communication from the Government to the Director-General of the ILO dated  May .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and",0,1971,Nicaragua
183,"Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state in their communication that they wish to draw attention to the serious violations of trade union rights and freedom by the National Guard and the Ministries of Labour and Education affecting the Federacin Sindical de Maestros de Nicaragua (Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation), which was founded on  March  and registered with the Ministry of Labour. The FSMN, state the complainants, was constituted in accordance with the Labour Code in force at that time, which laid down that "" Five trade unions may form themselves into a federation "" (section ). Accordingly, the teachers' unions of Boaco, Chinandega, Jinotaga, Matagalpa and Managua formed the FSMN, which was duly registered.
.On  August , the complainants continue, during a strike of the teaching body, groups of workers were sent under pressure by the National Guard to the "" Teachers' House "" to evict the teachers but they were quickly driven away by the students and other people who had come to defend the teachers.
.In October , the complainants add, the authorities froze the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua (, crdobas) and puppet unions were set up by the Ministries of Labour and Education. There was also direct intervention by these Ministries in the election of the leaders of the teachers' unions and meetings were attended by inspectors of public education, mayors, political leaders and police chiefs.
.The complainants further state that in December  the Government organised personal visits to all the teachers in order to oblige them to support the Government and td join the puppet unions. Refusal to do so, add the complainants, was likely to entail transfer or dismissal. Previously, on  October , the Government, faced with a general stoppage of work by the teaching body at all levels (primary, secondary and university-the latter for  hours as a token of solidarity), as well as by the teachers of Catholic schools, had ended the school year six weeks in advance.
.The complainants state that before the teachers' strike in support of their claims, three members of the executive of the FSMN, namely Mr. Leopoldo Montenegro Lara, Chairman of the union of teachers of Managua, Mr. Juan Alberto Henrique Oporta, press and information secretary of the executive committee of the FSMN, and Mrs. Silvia Villagrasa Gutirrez, record secretary of the same committee, were imprisoned. These persons were charged with being members of the FSLN (a clandestine organisation opposing the Government by military means). The Security Bureau, after torturing them and eliciting false statements from them, brought them before a judge who, being unable to find any valid charge, acquitted them unconditionally.
.On  November  the Ministry of Education began to dismiss teachers who had taken part in the strike. So far, say the complainants, there have been  dismissals, and it is feared that this figure may reach .
.In its reply the Government states that official policy has always been designed to ensure the existence and gradual improvement of the trade union movement and that every facility had been provided for the free exercise of their activities. Certain national trade unions, however, had pursued activities in fields forbidden by law and it was only natural, states the Government, that the State should intervene.
.The Government continues that the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation has itself admitted that on  August  the teaching body was on strike. This, states the Government, implied a flagrant breach of the national legislation and a complete lack of respect for the Basic Charter of Nicaragua and for the criminal laws. The same Federation has been guilty of repeated breaches of the law and of political activities. For example, it has ignored the provisions of section  of the Constitution, which provides for the dismissal of persons engaged in a concerted stoppage of work in public services or in services of vital importance to society. The Government adds that this Federation has also been guilty of a breach of section  (c) of Decree No.  of  November , which prohibits the incitement, in any form, of illegal strikes. It has also refused deliberately to conform to the rules governing the announcement of the intention to strike, when a strike is permitted by law, as laid down in section  et seq. of the Labour Code. The Government points out that, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, strikes in the public services are forbidden and any disputes between employers and workers must be submitted to the labour courts for a ruling.
.The Federation, continues the Government, has also been guilty of breaches of the Trade Union Regulations, which require every trade union to supply the labour authorities with information concerning changes in the composition of the executive, membership, etc., of the union and lay down certain regulations regarding federations of unions. In this connection, the Government claims that the Teachers' Trade Union Federation was composed of unions from different departments, thus contravening the provisions of section  of the above Regulations, which provides that trade unions from different departments may not form a federation.
.With regard to the stoppage of work by the teachers, the Government states that the complainant's allegation in this connection is an open confession of a breach of the law. The matter has been submitted to the Supreme Court of Justice, whose verdict is awaited.
.The Government denies that the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua were either frozen or seized. The Ministry, adds the Government, supervised the use of the funds in question to ensure against their misuse. This it did in response to a plea from the members of the Teachers' Union. The Union, states the Government, has at all times been free to use these funds and, in any event, it is not true that the funds amounted to , crdobas as stated by the complainants. In this connection the Government supplies, inter alia, copies of a certificate by the Director of Associations reporting the receipt of a plea from members of the Teachers' Union asking for the funds of the Union to be audited and the decision taken by the Director to this effect, copies of letters sent by the Bank of America to the Director of Associations reporting on the balance of the Union's accounts, and an audit certificate from the auditors of the Ministry of Labour. From the documents it also appears that the Union is not allowed to withdraw any sums from its bank accounts without the authorisation of the Director of Associations.
.The Committee notes that the complaint essentially concerns the action taken by the Government before, during and following a stoppage of work by the teaching body. The main allegations contained in the complaint relate to the imprisonment of certain trade union leaders, the right of the teaching body to proclaim a strike, the status of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the seizure of certain trade union funds by the authorities and acts of interference by the Government in the establishment of new trade unions.
.The Committee notes that the Government's reply contains no reference to the allegation that three executive members of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation were imprisoned. The Committee observes, however, that the complainants state that these persons were charged with being members of a clandestine organisation, and no information has been submitted to the Committee to indicate that the charges were in any way related to the trade union activities of these persons. In any event, the Committee notes that, according to the complainants, these persons have been released after having been brought to trial and in these circumstances it considers that this aspect of the complaint does not call for further examination.
.With regard to the strike action taken by the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the Committee notes that the Government takes the view that such a stoppage of work was in breach of the law since it involved a strike in the public services (teachers in government schools). The Committee assumes that the Government's reference to the teachers' non-observance of the normal procedure for initiating strikes can be taken to apply to teachers in Catholic schools.
.The Committee has taken the view that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they concern the exercise of trade union rights. In the case of public servants, the Committee has taken the view that recognition of the principle of freedom of association does not necessarily imply the right to strike. However, the Committee, in considering a number of cases of national legislation that denies the right to strike to public servants, has stressed the importance that it attaches, when strikes are prohibited or are subject to restrictions in essential services or in the civil service, to the establishment of adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the workers who are thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and it has pointed out that such restrictions should",0,1971,Nicaragua
184,"be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned may participate at every stage, and that the awards given should be in all cases binding on both parties. In the present case the Committee observes that public servants do not have the right to strike, this being specifically prohibited by section  of the Labour Code. The same section, however, provides, inter alia, for the hearing and settlement of disputes, in the case of public officials, by labour courts. The Committee, accordingly, does not consider that trade union rights have been infringed in this respect.
.As regards those teachers who are not in the employment of the State, the right to strike is not precluded, but the legislation provides for conciliation and arbitration procedures which must be exhausted before strike action can be taken (section  et seq. of the Labour Code). The Committee has, in a number of cases, recognised that prior notification to the administrative authority and provision for compulsory conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before calling a strike are provided for in the laws or regulations of a substantial number of countries and that reasonable provisions of this type cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association. Since, in the present case, the stoppage of work appears to have been declared without the conciliation and arbitration procedures having been exhausted, the Committee also considers that there has been no infringement of freedom of association.
.With regard to the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the Committee notes that, by virtue of section  of the Trade Union Regulations, the establishment of federations by unions in different departments is prohibited. The Committee considers that such a provision constitutes a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to establish federations and Confederations, recognised by Article  of Convention No. . In this connection the Committee recalls the importance that should be attached to the principle, laid down in Article  of Convention No. , that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing, a principle that implies for the organisations themselves the right to establish and join federations and Confederations of their own choosing s (Articles  and  of the Convention). The Committee therefore considers that the conditions laid down by law for the organisation of federations are incompatible with these standards, which include the right of trade unions to form such federations as they see fit.
.As regards the allegation that the Ministry of Labour intervened, following a request by members of the Union, to audit and freeze the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, the Committee has, in a number of cases, stated that the principles established in Article  of Convention No.  do not prevent the control of the internal acts of a trade union if those internal acts violate the law; at the same time the law of the land must not be such as to infringe the principles on freedom of association. The Committee has also considered that it is of the greatest importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, this control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, The Committee has also recalled that measures of supervision over the administration of trade unions, even if it is said that they are intended to protect the members of the trade union themselves against mismanagement of their funds, may, in certain cases, entail a danger of interference by the public authorities in the administration of trade unions, and that this interference may be of such a nature as to restrict the rights of organisations or impede the lawful exercise thereof, contrary to Convention No. . It may be considered, nevertheless, that there is a certain measure of guarantee against such interference where the official appointed to exercise supervision enjoys some degree of independence of the administrative authorities and where he is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities. The Committee considers, in the present case, that the measures taken with regard to the funds of the trade union concerned do not conform to these principles. In addition, the Committee notes from the information supplied that the Teachers' Trade Union of Managua is still unable to draw upon its bank accounts without the express authorisation of the Director of Associations of the Ministry of Labour. The Committee considers that such interference by the authorities runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee further notes that no information is supplied by the Government in connection with the allegation that the authorities intervened in elections and meetings of teachers' trade unions and that puppet trade unions were set up which teachers were forced to join. In this connection the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance it attaches to the standards set by Article  of Convention No. , whereby governments are required to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers and employers may freely exercise the right to organise, and by Article  of Convention No. , which provides that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that the trade union leaders Leopoldo Montenegro Lara, Juan Alberto Henrique Oporta and Silvia Villagrasa Gutirrez were released after having been brought to trial and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the right to strike of teachers, to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) with regard to the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the legislation in force is incompatible with the right of trade unions to establish federations of their own choosing;(d) with regard to the allegation that the Ministry of Labour seized control of the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, to draw the Government's attention to the principle that control over the internal acts of a trade union should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, or by a person who enjoys some degree of independence of the administrative authorities and who is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities, and to point out that the authorisation still required by the Teachers' Union of Managua to draw on its bank accounts runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities;(e) with regard to the allegation concerning interference by the authorities in the establishment of new unions, to draw the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom; and(f) to invite the Government to revise the legislation concerning trade unions in the light of the above considerations, and to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the present case.",1,1971,Nicaragua
185,".The Committee first examined this case at its May  session (see paragraphs - of the Committee's th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session in May-June ) and again at its November  session (see paragraphs - of the rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in November ).
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case concerns allegations that, as a consequence of a wave of repression and persecution directed against trade union organisations, two leaders of the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), an affiliate member of the WCL, were arrested and imprisoned, and further allegations according to which the Ministry of Labour took sides in a dispute between the workers and the firm of ""El Porvenir"", in which the workers were subjected to harsh military discipline.Allegations Relating to Measures Taken Against Two Trade Union Leaders
.At its May  session, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request further information from the Government concerning its statement that the action taken against the two MOSAN leaders was motivated by their having been caught sticking up subversive posters.
.In a communication of  February , the Government supplied no further information and confined itself to repeating the terms of the reply already examined by the Committee at its May  session. In a communication dated  May , the Government stated that in its opinion its was for the State of Nicaragua alone, in the exercise of its sovereignty, to decide whether or not the posters were of a subversive nature. In a communication dated  May  the Government repeated this viewpoint. None of these communications shed any light on the nature of the posters in question, as had been requested by the Committee.
.At its November  Session, the Committee considered it desirable to recall that, in accordance with Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Nicaragua, the law of the land may not be such as to impair, nor may it be so applied as to impair, the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee pointed out that the Government's failure to furnish a reply could leave room for doubt as to the Government's observance of this provision. The Committee further recalled that, in accordance with the procedure laid down for the protection of freedom of association, the question as to whether a sentence related to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights could not be resolved unilaterally by the government concerned, but was a matter for the Committee to decide after examining all available information. The Committee, consequently, recommended the Governing Body once more to request the Government to furnish as soon as possible information concerning the subject matter of the incriminating posters.
.In a communication dated  December , the Government deplores the fact that attention should still be focused on an event which occurred more than two years ago, when the persons involved in certain disturbances have been released and enjoy full freedom. The arrest of Nicaraguan citizens who were committing unlawful acts has nothing whatsoever to do with their being or not being trade unionists. The Government states that in accordance with the law normal police action was taken. The Government also rejects the allegation that a wave of repression and persecution was directed against trade union organisations.Allegations Relating to the Situation in the Firm of ""El Porvenir""
.At its May  session the Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government gave an assurance that - contrary to what was alleged in the complaint - the Ministry of Labour had at no time taken sides and that relations between employers and workers in the firm of ""El Porvenir"" were peaceful and harmonious. In its communication of  May , the Government reaffirmed what it had stated in its previous communication. It added, nevertheless, that the Ministry of Labour had concerned itself solely with the enforcement of the provisions of the Nicaraguan Labour Code, particularly sections  et seq, which govern the procedure to be followed in the event of collective disputes of an economic or social nature between employers and workers, and sections  et seq, which lay down rules with regard to strikes.
.These sections define a strike as being lawful when it has been authorised by the competent conciliation board or labour magistrate, according to the circumstances. A strike is authorised only when all the procedures prescribed in the Code in the event of disputes have been followed: () submission of a statement of demands to the labour inspector; () report by the labour inspector to the Ministry of Labour, which appoints a judge to deal with the strike and whose task it is to set up a conciliation board; () appearance of the parties involved before the conciliation board (all strike action being prohibited if the labour side fails to appear); () voting on the proposals of the management by the workers, who must accept or reject these proposals by a  per cent majority vote () a fresh vote, the same majority being required, to decide whether to pursue negotiations or to take strike action. When the prescribed majority is reached, the board can authorise the strike, though its decision may be appealed against before the higher labour court (the appeal has suspensive effect and the court must give a ruling within  hours). When  days have elapsed after a strike has been authorised, the dispute is submitted to compulsory arbitration and the arbitration award is binding on both parties for a period of at least six months. Any strike declared without authorisation is considered unlawful and legally inexistent, automatically entailing the termination of the strikers' contract of employment, without prejudice to the imposing of other penalties.
.In view of the fact that the Government had not indicated the circumstances in which the Ministry of Labour intervened to ensure the enforcement of the provisions governing collective disputes and to settle the strike in question, the Committee, at its November  session, considered it necessary to point out:(a) that allegations with regard to the right to strike were not outside its competence in so far as they concerned the exercise of trade union rights;(b) that it had already made it clear in the past, in referring to its recommendation that restrictions on the right to strike were acceptable if accompanied by adequate conciliation and arbitration procedures, that the recommendation in question referred not to the absolute prohibition of the right to strike but to the restriction of that right in essential services or in the public service, in relation to which the Committee had established that adequate guarantees should be provided to safeguard the workers' interests;(c) that, while taking note of the information contained in the Government's observations concerning the provisions governing the settlement of collective disputes, the Committee noted that the provisions in question restricted the right to strike not only in essential services but for all workers. Being accordingly of the opinion that the observations made in the previous subparagraph applied to the present case, the Committee considered that the Government should take account of them and recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance attached by the Governing Body to these considerations.
.Since the Government had not supplied more detailed information as to which provisions of the Labour Code the Ministry of Labour had applied in the firm of ""El Porvenir"", the Committee also recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply this information as soon as possible.
.In its communication of  December , the Government rejects the allegation concerning military discipline of the workers and denies that the authorities took sides in dealing with the dispute in the firm of ""El Porvenir"". According to the Government the provisions of the Labour Code applied were those governing the procedure to be followed in the event of collective disputes of an economic or social nature and strikes. The Government points out that where concerted stoppages of work take place without the requirements of the law being fulfilled, section  of the Code is applied.
.Section  provides that if a strike is commenced without the authorisation referred to in the Code (see paragraph  above), the General Labour Inspectorate or conciliation board will declare it unlawful and legally inexistent, with all the legal consequences resulting from such declaration.
.The Committee observes that in its latest communication the Government, despite the repeated requests made to it, still refrains from sending the specific information requested in connection with the allegations concerning measures taken against two trade union leaders. As regards the allegations concerning the dispute in",0,1970,Nicaragua
186,"the firm of ""El Porvenir"", it would appear from the Government's communication that since the workers had not fulfilled the necessary conditions to be able to take lawful strike action, they were refused the authorisation for which provision is made by law. Nevertheless the Government does not describe the exact circumstances that gave rise to this refusal or the specific legislative provisions infringed by the workers.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore the fact that, despite the amount of time that has elapsed, the Government has failed to supply detailed information on the allegations, as requested by the Governing Body, thus making it impossible for the Committee to draw up its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts;(b) to draw the attention of the Government once more to the considerations in paragraphs  and  above; and(c) to decide, in view of the fact that the arrested trade union leaders are free and that the situation in the firm of ""El Porvenir"" has been restored to normal, no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of the case.
.The Committee first examined this case at its May  session (see th Report, May , paragraphs  to ), when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ). In this interim report the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish additional information on certain aspects of the case (see paragraphs  and  of the th Report).
.This case arose out of allegations according to which, as part of a wave of repression and persecution directed against trade unions, two leaders of the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), an affiliate of the WCL, had been arrested and imprisoned, and further allegations according to which the Ministry of Labour had taken sides in a dispute between the employees and the firm of "" El Porvenir "", said to be subjecting its employees to harsh military discipline.
.The aspects of the case concerning which the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request additional information from the Government relate, firstly, to a statement by the Government to the effect that the action taken against the two MOSAN leaders was due to the fact they had been caught sticking up subversive posters and, secondly, to the fact that the Government had furnished no answer to the allegations concerning the situation in the firm of "" El Porvenir "".
.The Committee adjourned its examination of the case at its sessions in November  (see paragraph  of its th Report) and February  (see paragraph  of its th Report) since the observations requested from the Government had not been received. The Committee again adjourned its examination of the case at its session in May  (see paragraph  of its st Report), since the Government's observations had been received too late for the Committee to examine them in substance.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the allegations relating to measures taken against two trade union leaders:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the observations made in paragraphs  and  above;(ii) to request the Government once again to furnish information as soon as possible concerning the subject-matter of the incriminating posters;(b) as concerns the allegations relating to military discipline and to the situation in the firm of "" El Porvenir ""(i) to draw the Government's attention to the observations made in paragraph  (a), (b) and (c) above;(ii) to request the Government once again to furnish as soon as possible the information in mentioned paragraph ;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the information requested from the Government.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour is contained in a communication dated  May , supplemented by two further communications dated respectively  May and  June . The complaint and the additional information supplied in substantiation thereof were transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations concerning their substance by a communication dated  February .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.On the basis of information supplied to it by its affiliated organisation in Nicaragua, the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), the World Confederation of Labour alleges in general terms that a wave of repression and persecution has been unleashed against trade unions and their members in that country. More specifically, it alleges that two leaders of the MOSAN, Messrs. Fernando Caracas Ricaurte and Guillermo Mejia, have been arrested and imprisoned.
.Appended to the supplementary information it has supplied in connection with this case, the World Confederation of Labour has furnished photocopies of the receipts for fines paid by Messrs. Caracas Ricaurte and Mejia, stating that these fines were the only means whereby they could regain their freedom. "" As you will observe, "" declares the World Confederation of Labour "" these receipts do not record any details, nor do they specify any particular offence as having been committed, which is yet further proof that in the Republic of Nicaragua the most fundamental workers' rights are disregarded, their leaders being imprisoned, heavy fines being imposed upon trade union officials and members and union members being terrorised if they defend the interests of the workers and refuse to submit to the dictates of the Government and the police "".
.Furthermore, on the basis of fresh information received from its affiliate in Nicaragua, the World Confederation of Labour accuses the Ministry of Labour of taking sides in a dispute between the workers and the firm of "" El Porvenir "", which it alleges to be "" subjecting its employees to harsh military discipline "". "" This is quite understandable,"" continues the World Confederation of Labour "" bearing in mind that the undertaking in question is owned by the President of the Republic, General Somoza, whose family has ruled the country for thirty years "".
.In its observations the Government states that the reason for the measures taken against Messrs. Caracas Ricaurte and Mejia was that they were caught in the act of sticking up subversive posters, and that these measures were taken in pursuance of Decree No.  of , the text of which the Government supplies. The Government also supplies the text of a statement made in this connection by the Police Magistrate of Managua, and points out that the persons in question have not appealed against the Police Magistrate's ruling.
.The Government argues that the World Confederation of Labour has based its allegations on information supplied by a "" non-existent "" organisation, the Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), "" of serious breaches of freedom of association in Nicaragua "", adding that this information too is unlawful and unfounded, and that "" in any case it should not be taken into consideration since this organisation has no legal personality, the Associations Department of the General Inspectorate of Labour having no record on its books of the registration of the so-called Autonomous Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua "". The Government appends to its communication an attestation; from the Associations Department of the General Inspectorate of Labour to the effect that it has no record of the registration of the MOSAN.
.Before examining the specific allegations made in the complaint, the Committee considers that it should deal with the preliminary question raised by the Government in the observations quoted in the preceding paragraph. In this connection the Committee wishes to point out that it has never considered itself bound by any national definition of the term ""industrial association"". In the present case the Committee notes that the MOSAN does have at least a de facto existence and that it is affiliated to the World Confederation of Labour. Moreover, the complaint having been filed in the names of the latter organisation, which enjoys consultative status with the ILO, its receivability in this instance cannot be open to the doubt that the Government appears to imply.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the measures taken against Messrs. Caracas Ricaurte and Mejia, the Committee has noted the Government's statement to the effect that these measures were taken because the persons concerned had been caught in the act of sticking up subversive posters.
.The Government does not indicate, however, what was subversive about the posters in question, and the attestation by the Police Magistrate appended by the Government to its reply is no more explicit on this point. Accordingly the Committee, in order to have all the facts before it when forming its opinion, considers it necessary to recommend the Governing",1,1970,Nicaragua
187,"Body to request the Government to be good enough to give details of the subject-matter of the incriminating posters.
.Having noted, moreover, that the Government makes no reply to the allegations mentioned in paragraph  above to the effect that the Ministry of Labour appears to have taken sides in a dispute between the workers and the firm of "" El Porvenir "", and that this undertaking has been "" subjecting its employees to harsh military discipline "", the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to forward its observations on this aspect of the case.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adjourn its examination of the case on the understanding that the Committee will report again as soon as it is in possession of the additional information to which reference is made in the two preceding paragraphs.",1,1970,Nicaragua
188,".The complaint by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) of Nicaragua, the Peasants' and Agricultural Workers' Confederation of Nicaragua and the Federation of Workers of Managua is contained in a communication dated  July . The complaint was forwarded to the Government, which made its observations thereon in a letter dated  December .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged in the complaint that on  July  the police searched the headquarters of the complainant organisations and that twenty leaders and members of affiliated unions were arrested while holding meetings. The authorities responsible for these measures are stated to have claimed that they were necessary to forestall possible disturbances. The reason was that on the date in question, the President of the United States was due to call at the International Airport of Nicaragua and this had given rise to demonstrations by students and political organisations. The complainants add that the legal adviser to the CGT applied to the Court of Appeal for the release of the arrested trade unionists but that it took the Court ten days to name a judge to hear the case. A protest was also made to the President and to the Minister of Labour, but no reply was received from these authorities. After spending five days in custody, the detained persons were finally released, but without the intervention of any court.
.In its reply the Government states that in the Ministry of Labour there is a department which is responsible for dealing with all trade union affairs, including complaints concerning infringements of trade union rights. The department in question has received no complaint regarding the events alleged by the complainants. The Government adds that in connection with the visit of the President of the United States the authorities took a number of preventive measures, since it was known that serious acts were being planned in certain quarters to cause a breach of the peace. These measures had no connection with trade unionism nor was there any search of union premises. The authorities merely interrogated certain individuals (some of whom belonged to the unions mentioned in the complaint) concerning the plans that were being made. The Government denies that freedom of association was in any way infringed and states that it guarantees this freedom. It points out that in  it ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and is now examining a draft Bill to reform the regulations governing trade unions so as to implement fully these instruments. In addition, Parliament has now given its approval to the establishment of a Tripartite Committee on Freedom of Association and Labour Participation in National Development Planning. The Government concludes by saying that it can take appropriate preventive measures to maintain law and order and the fact that these may have been directed against persons connected with a trade union who are engaged in actions designed to disturb law and order in no way constitutes a breach of trade union rights.
.The Committee notes that the complainants and the Government are in agreement regarding the preventive detention of a number of trade unionists in connection with the visit of the President of the United States to Nicaragua. The Government denies, however, that trade union premises were searched or that the complainants lodged a protest with the Ministry of Labour. As regards the allegation in the complaint about the delay in the legal proceedings instituted to secure the release of the arrested men, the Government makes no comment in its letter.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in previous cases in which it was alleged that trade union leaders had been kept in preventive detention, it has considered that such measures may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period, and that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the observation of human rights and especially the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.In the present case, according to the Government, precautionary measures were taken against certain persons, including a number of union leaders, in order to prevent public disturbances. However, the Committee notes that these leaders were not placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities but that the police itself released them after a few days without apparently having discovered any evidence which would justify bringing them to trial. The Committee considers that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the Political Constitution of Nicaragua itself. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee also wished to recall that on other occasions it has pointed out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, and in these cases it has recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.As regards the alleged searching of trade union headquarters, which the Government denies in its reply, the Committee considers that trade unions cannot claim immunity from search provided that the judicial authorities have issued an appropriate warrant. The complainants have not supplied any more detailed information on this aspect of the case which would enable the Committee to formulate its conclusions thereon.
.Accordingly, having regard to the fact that the trade unionists in question have been released, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, subject to the considerations set forth in the preceding paragraphs, to decide that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1968,Nicaragua
189,".The complaints are contained in a telegram from the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.) dated  February  and a communication from the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions dated  February . By a communication of  February  the LF.C.T.U supplied additional information concerning this case. All these communications were transmitted to the Government, which replied by a letter dated  March .
.Nicaragua has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The I.F.C.T.U alleges that the Government violently repressed trade union demonstrations organised in particular by the Independent Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN) when numerous trade union leaders were arrested. Both the I.F.C.T.U and the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions urgently request the I.L.O to intervene in favour of Mr. Edgar Macias Gmez, General Secretary of MOSAN, who, it is alleged, was arrested by the military police and disappeared as from  or  January .
.In its reply dated  March  the Government states that Mr. Macias is not only at liberty but is resident in Managua and carrying on his normal activities. The Government attached a newspaper cutting dated  February  reporting that on the previous day Mr. Macias had gone to the newspaper headquarters with another trade union leader to make certain statements concerning the murder of a trade unionist.
.With regard to the allegation of the I.F.C.T.U concerning the repression of trade union demonstrations, the Government states that it has no knowledge of any trade union demonstrations or violent repressive action on the part of the authorities, nor of any person detained on account of trade union activities. It adds that what took place in Managua on  January  was a political demonstration to support a presidential candidate, when the demonstrators, incited to revolt against the Government, attempted to take possession of police headquarters and killed an officer and two soldiers and wounded  others. The Government states that the measures taken by it averted a situation of bloody tragedy and that all the persons who took part in the revolt are now at liberty.
.As regards the allegations relating to the repression of trade union demonstrations and the arrest of trade unionists connected with such demonstrations, the Committee notes that the complaint does not supply such details as the date and place of the demonstrations or the reason for organising them, or the names of the persons arrested. The Government, on the other hand, states that nobody is at present detained on account of trade union activities and mentions a political demonstration which seems to have taken place a few days before the date of the complaint, the persons who took part in it now being at liberty. In view of these statements of the Government and the vagueness of the allegations presented, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further consideration.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Macias the Committee notes the Government's statement which neither denies nor confirms the arrest of that trade unionist on the date given by the complainants but affirms that Mr. Macias is at liberty.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the repression of trade union demonstrations and the arrest of trade unionists taking part therein to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that no useful purpose would be served by the further exanimation of these allegations;(b) as regards the particular case of Mr. Edgar Macias Gmez, General Secretary of the Independent Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), who, according to the complainants, was arrested on  or  January , to take note of the Government's statement that this person is at liberty.",0,1967,Nicaragua
190,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  addressed to the Director-General by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.). The text of the complaint was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  May .
.At its th Session (June ) the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, which is contained in paragraph  of the th Report, requested further observations and information from the Government concerning the two aspects of the case that were left pending, these being the complainants' allegations concerning two trade union, leaders, Mr. Amadeo Vanegas and Mrs. Lidia Madariaga.
.The Government has replied to this request by a letter dated  December .
.Nicaragua, in October , ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and regarding the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that, subject to the principle mentioned in paragraph  above, the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  May  addressed to the Director-General by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (I.F.C.T.U.). The text of the complaint was transmitted to the Government by a letter dated  May  to enable it to submit its observations.
.Besides the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U, which is admissible under the procedure in force since the complaining organisation is an international Organisation having consultative status with the I.L.O, several other complaints referring to the same occurrences have been received from trade union organisations operating in countries other than Nicaragua. On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body decided that these additional complaints could not be received under the procedure in force because they emanated from national organisations of workers in countries other than the one to which the complaints relate and having no direct interest in the matters raised in the allegations. The decisions of the Governing Body concerning the complaints dismissed as irreceivable were conveyed to the Government at the proper time.
.Concerning the complaint submitted by the I.F.C.T.U, the Committee, at its meeting held in November , took note of a communication from the Government announcing the future submission of the observations for which it had been asked and decided to post pone it; consideration of the case until such time as it should have received those observations. At its meeting held in February  the Committee again postponed its examination of this matter to the following session, since the Government's observations contained in its communication dated  February  had been received too late.
.Nicaragua has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  May  the I.F.C.T.U alleges that Mr. Amadeo Vanegas, a leader of the Independent Trade Union Movement of Nicaragua (MOSAN), went to the locality of Santa Rosa del Pen in order to hold a meeting with the workers of a chalk quarry. Upon his arrival he was detained by the local police in accordance with alleged orders from their superiors. The complainants add that Mr. Vanegas was taken on foot to the town limits of Santa Rosa del Pen, where he was released, and that a member of MOSAN, Lidia Madariaga, who had witnessed the unlawful detention of Mr. Vanegas, followed him in order to see what happened and approached him after he had been released. "" Shortly after "", the I.F.C.T.U goes on to state, "" Lidia Madariaga was found dead on the road back to Santa Rosa del Pen, with her skull crushed in."" The complainants refer to the lack of safeguards for trade union rights and add that the facts they report are a flagrant violation of the Constitution and international standards of the I.L.O.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government referred to the previous communications from the Director-General informing it of the Governing Body's decision that various complaints connected with this case were irreceivable on the basis of the recommendation made by the Committee on Freedom of Association and in accordance with the procedure in force.
.The Government further stated that the police and judicial authorities had investigated the circumstances of the death of Mrs. Lidia Madariaga and had ascertained that it was an ordinary crime passionnel and in no way connected with trade union matters; the murderer had been tried and sentenced. The Government added that it was refraining from sending the documents connected with the case "" because the complaints lodged had been deemed irreceivable ""; it had therefore considered the matter as closed and any subsequent request as being out of order.
.In view of this last statement the Committee wishes to point out that, in connection with the present case, the Government had been requested to supply its observations concerning the complaint lodged by the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions on  May  (see paragraphs  and  above). The communications recalling the Government's attention to this request referred expressly to the complaint of the I.F.C.T.U which is the only text that has been transmitted to the Government for that purpose, being a receivable complaint in accordance with the procedure in force. Consequently, the fact that the Committee should have considered inadmissible other complaints relating to the same case does not prevent it from continuing its examination of the allegations made by the I.F.C.T.U.
.These allegations refer, first and foremost, to the action of the police who, by detaining and forcibly conducting Mr. Amadeo Vanegas away from his destination, prevented him from holding a meeting with a group of workers. The Government does not refer specifically in its observations to this aspect of the matter.
.As regards the death of Mrs. Lidia Madariaga which, according to the complainants seemed to have been the result of her trade union activities, the Government states that this crime had nothing to do with trade union matters and that the criminal had been tried and sentenced. The Government further states that it has not sent any documents relating to the judgments because it considered the examination of the case by the Committee as closed.
.The Committee, however, considers it appropriate to point out, as it has done in many previous cases, that it has regularly followed the practice, when called upon to examine matters which were the subject of national judicial proceedings, of requesting the governments concerned to furnish the text of the judgments pronounced and the grounds adduced therein, where it considered that this information would be of assistance to it in appreciating whether or not allegations were well founded.
.In these circumstances, before proceeding with its examination of the case, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be so good as to send its observations concerning the allegations to the effect that the trade union leader, Mr. Amadeo Vanegas, was detained and conducted outside the city limits by the police of Santa Rosa del Pen because he had tried to hold a meeting with a group of workers;(b) for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, to request the Government to be good enough to furnish the text of the judgment pronounced on the murderer of the trade unionist Mrs. Lidia Madariaga, together with the grounds adduced therein;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the observations and additional information referred to under subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.",0,1966,Nicaragua
