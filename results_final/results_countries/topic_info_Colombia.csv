This occurred whilst the persons concerned were keeping vigil over the body of the official Henry Cuenca, who had been recently murdered.- On  November  at . a.m., a military patrol made up of scores of uniformed soldiers and a civilian, led by Lieutenant Juan Carlos Salazar Tobn (assigned to the th Brigade with its headquarters in the town of Bucaramanga), proceeded to search the headquarters of the Teachers\' Trade Union of Santander (SES). The soldiers surrounded the trade union headquarters and, after presenting a search warrant from the Military Criminal Examining Magistrate No. , they searched the headquarters and arrested Guillermo Ramrez, member of the trade union and Executive of the Trade Union of Workers of Santander (USITRAS). At . a.m. on the same day, a second search was carried out at the SES headquarters, during which the soldiers confiscated the offset equipment used by the trade union to print its publications. This is the third time that the trade union headquarters has been subjected to police or army searches in one year. On  October , the trade union headquarters was searched a few minutes after unknown persons had placed a bomb in front of the building. On  September , a grenade exploded in a doorway of the building and five minutes later a police patrol tried to search the headquarters. Guillermo Ramrez\'s family are afraid about his situation because, until now, the authorities have denied his arrest. According to the family, his name does not appear on the lists registering entries to the th Brigade.\n.Allegations concerning the failure to recognise the legal personality of a trade union\n.The CGT and the CLAT allege that, on  May , a group of workers connected with the Chamber of Commerce of Bogot, acting in accordance with the standards in force, set up the trade union organisation named Trade Union of Workers of the Chamber of Commerce of Bogot (SINTRACAMCOB), and that on  May , they deposited documents with the Ministry of Labour with a view to obtaining the legal personality of this organisation. However, on  June , the documents were returned by the Attorney of the Trade Union Regulations and Registration Section of the Ministry of Labour, with a list of observations, in which it was stated that all mention of the right to strike must be deleted in the Statutes ""because it is considered that the body meets a need that is of general interest"".\n.In its communication of  October , the Government states that the wave of violence and criminality that has been sweeping the country during the past few years not only affects trade union leaders and members but also politicians of all tendencies or persuasions, magistrates and judges, members of the police force, priests, civic leaders, peasants and the country as a whole, as there are a number of complex and specific reasons for this violence - such as drug trafficking, left-wing and right-wing extremist movements, groups of common-law criminals and terrorists. All these factors have combined to make the situation complex and difficult to overcome. Various groups with conflicting interests are actively trying to prevent the Government\'s attempts to provide democracy with a sounder basis and to guarantee human rights for all Colombians. These groups involved in organised crime have resulted in the emergence of armed hired assassins, who in order to defend their interests, murder people, either individually or collectively, who oppose their illicit aims - whether public officials, private citizens or trade union leaders. Recently, it has been the criminal actions of these groups, who are being financed by drug trafficking cartels, which have done the most to undermine public law and order within the country.\n.Faced with this violent situation, the Government points out that, as a sign of its unyielding determination to maintain law and order, it resorted to emergency legislation with the accompanying powers entrusted in it under the national Constitution, so as to introduce effective measures to re-establish public order. Decrees Nos. ,  and  of  April  set up a co-ordinating committee to fight against terrorism, created a Special Armed Corps (lite) made up of members of the National Police to grapple with terrorism and amended a number of standards in force on national defence to restrict the carrying of arms by individuals. These measures resulted first of all in the dismantling of a number of ""hired assassins\' schools"" in the Magdalena Medio and the Llanos Orientales regions, the initial arrest of at least  members of ""self-defence groups"" and the confiscation of airplanes, vehicles, arms and a large quantity of narcotics. The main leaders of these armed groups or ""death squads"" were also successfully identified and, on  August , units from the National Police arrested Alonso de Jess Baquero Agudelo (alias Vladimir), accused of having been the brains behind the massacre which occurred in La Rochela, the municipal administration of Barrancabermeja (Santander), when  officials from the judiciary were murdered; he is also said to have taken part in the massacres in El Diamante, Honduras, la Negra, Punta Coquitos and la Mejor Esquina. Similarly, on  March , police units arrested Oscar Moreno Rivera and Jess Antonio Crdenas in Barrancabermeja (Santander), both of whom are accused of having taken part in the massacre of La Rochela.\n.The Administrative Department of Security (DAS) and other state security bodies have also obtained concrete results in dismantling the above-mentioned defence groups, above all those in the Magdalena Medio, which are responsible for the escalation of violence that has unleashed indiscriminate terrorism - and many representatives of Colombian trade unionism have been the victims of this terrorism. These groups were protected by sectors concerned that crimes should not come to light, amongst others the ""Association of Peasants and Cattle Raisers of the Magdalena Medio (ACDEGAM)"" and the ""Movement for National Reorganisation (MORENA)"", illegal associations that violate the democratic principles contained in the Constitution; however, these were uncovered by the authorities as a result of inquiries made by the security organisations. These inquiries also revealed that the former commander of the Puerto Boyac Battalion (Boyac) had participated in these activities. The competent authorities immediately took the necessary measures to relieve him of his duties and to instigate the respective proceedings. Similarly, a former town councillor of Puerto Boyac, Diego Vifara Salinas, was also arrested, and, as a result of his statements, those who had participated in the massacres at the La Honduras and La Negra estates in March  and the Punta Coquitos estate in Urab Antioqueo and La Mejor Esquina estate in Crdoba the following April were identified. The Administrative Department of Security (DAS) is carrying out investigations on the assumed link of staff in state security bodies with these events and to determine who carried out such actions in an isolated way and in violation of the standards of these institutions. The Director of DAS also related that the inquiries carried out by this Department revealed the involvement of foreign persons who, acting as mercenaries, provided instruction to paramilitary groups and conducted criminal actions in the country. The authorities and respective magistrates have been informed of these inquiries so that they might take the necessary measures.\n.According to the report of the Director of DAS, that was submitted to the Congress of the Republic on  September , members of this body were able to dismantle training camps and gatherings of hired assassins in Guicn (Boyac), Puerto Lpez (Meta), Santa Marta, Magdalena and Bogot during the first four months of ; at the same time, self-defence groups in the Magdalena Medio, Llanos Orientales, Bajo Cauca and Alto Sin were also dismantled. It further added that as from April , more than  groups of hired assassins operating on instructions from ""drug cartels"" were dismantled in Medelln, Envigado, San Luis and', 'a legal entity by virtue of its very establishment, as from the date of its constitutent assembly"".\n.As regards infringements of the right of freedom of association, they are defined as criminal acts and punished in accordance with the detailed provisions of section  of Act No.  of . They may also give rise to administrative sanctions. The right to freedom of association is now enshrined in the Constitution; through Act No.  of , the State has established more effective machinery to ensure the prompt settlement of disputes. Furthermore, the Ministry ensures the right to collective bargaining, facilitating the quick settlement of disputes by intervening when requested to do so by the parties, by convening arbitration courts when called for by law, or by imposing the appropriate penalties on enterprises refusing to enter into a dialogue when claims and demands are filed in due form. In  (through June)  new trade union organizations came into existence and  collective agreements were signed. (Source: Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Labour.)\n.As regards the possible revision of the Anti-terrorism Act, the Government points out that such action is reserved for the competent government authorities, and namely the Congress of the Republic.\n.As regards the numerous allegations of acts of violence committed against trade unionists, the Government points out that the cases regarding the following people are currently at various stages of investigation: Hernando Valencia Laso, the Montes Ovalle families, Luis Carlos Prez, Martha Luz Loaiza Valencia, Jairo Sandoval Enciso, Marta Gavalo Rivas, Vctor Vsquez Padilla, Alberto Gmez, Oscar Arias, Omar Ramrez, Jos Ignacio Vargas, AlbeiroLondoo, Jos Omar Patio Rincn, Jos Santo Mendivelso Coconubo, Edgar Poe Foronda, Cicern Ortiz Parada, Alejandro Salazar Paz and others (those murdered at Los Uvos), Julio Daniel Chaparro and Jorge Enrique Torres Navas, Alonso Lara Martnez and Marina Villaborna Forero, Bendicto Cubides Forero and Mara Snchez, Anbal Silvestre and Javier Rengifo, Alvaro Quintero, Guillermo Rojas, Jacobo Beltrn Novoa, Alfredo Parejo Gmez, Rodrigo Navarro Pinto and Robert Valet Fuentes, Martn Arias and Eduardo Arias, Luis Eduardo Tejada and others, Antonio Palacios Urrea and others (those murdered at Fusagasug), Ligia Patricia Corts Colmenares and others, Flix Juvenal Vega Rodelo, Jaime Arturo Marrugo Jaraba, Benancio and Reynaldo Jos Narvez Figueroa, Gabriel Ovidio and others, Jos Ramrez Vergara, Moiss Narvez Gmez, Luis Ramos Toledo, Pablo Len, Daro Vsquez and Fernando Sarmiento, Jess Alirio Guevara Angarita, Aroldo Gallego and others, Oliverio Molina (Jos Oliveros Molina, according to the Special Prosecutor), Mara Elena Ordoez and Arturo Valencia Castillo, Vladimir Hincapi Galeano and Csar Chaparro Navia, Samuel Fernando Roja Mota, Raquel Judith and Jorge Ernesto Bernal Dueas, Humberto Murillo and others, and Emilio Valencia Vallecilla. As regards the allegation of a massacre of  workers on  January  in Barrancabermeja, the Government is certain that this incident did not take place.\n.On the other hand, the Government also reports that the following cases are not included in the Ministry of Labour\'s registry: Luis Eduardo Padilla, Tefilo Carrillo, David Osuna;  July  seven farmworkers murdered by a bomb blast;  January  two workers of the Frontino mines; February  Jess Anbal Angel;  February  the death of three farmworkers in Pechiln and Naranjal; Emeterio Rueda, the leader of FENSUAGRO;  April  the death of four farmworkers in El Floral; trade unionist Gabriel Tapia;  May  the attack on the leader of the farmworkers\' union, Matas Funes;  March  deaths in the Manzana and Flora banana farms;  March  Luz Miriam Pealoza, Soacha; Consuelo Castaeda, Luis Carlos Lozano, Yumbo; Alvaro Roa, Medelln, and Nubia Jimnez and Elisa Impus, Nevia.\n.In its communication of  October  the Government reports that it is investigating the case of Mr. Valencia Lasso Hernando, that the Montes Ovalle family\'s complaints are being investigated by the Special Prosecutor, and that no evidence of harassment has been found.\n.In its communications of  April and  October  the Government reports that the courts have ordered investigations into the murders of Emilio Rueda Ortiz, Heriberto Lpez, Apolinar Fabra, Romn Hernndez and Freddy Enrique Meja, and into the disappearances of Luis Alberto Builes, Alvaro Usuga, Marcial Alonso Gonzlez and Lucio Serrano Luna.\n.In its communication of November  the Government states that, as regards the problem of violence in Colombia and measures being taken to combat it, a plethora of forces contribute to the generalized context of violence in the country. They include widespread social violence, political violence and violence linked to drug trafficking. Among these, according to studies conducted by the CINEP, only  per cent is attributable to political violence. It should be emphasized that the Colombian State is not opposed to trade unionism; on the contrary, the Government has every interest in defending the rights of workers. The problem in the country with respect to this defence is one involving the deinstitutionalization of the handling of disputes between the social partners. On the one hand, some employers, allied with officials of the Administrative Department of Security or officials of other state security organizations, are harassing trade union leaders; they are not, however, doing so with impunity. On the other hand, trade unionists are forging alliances with guerrilla and other forces to harass employers or their agents. The State, which is concerned about this generalized violence and deinstitutionalization, is trying to create an awareness that forces having nothing to do with social and labour questions should not interfere in relations between employers and workers.\n.The Government points out that the first phase of the National Strategy against violence, to which it referred in previous communications, resulted in the following successes: greater leadership of the civilian authorities in ensuring security; a stronger system of justice, a better-equipped law enforcement service and a more effective intelligence service; the State has retaken the initiative against those responsible for violent acts; there are fewer kidnappings in Colombia; there is an open door to dialogue for those who genuinely want peace; and the defence and promotion of human rights are priorities for the Government.\n.The Government is making progress in the second stage of the National Strategy against violence, which aims at a policy to ensure that the citizens are safe and that there is peaceful coexistence. This policy is based on a two-pronged approach: the consolidation of efforts to strengthen the systems of justice and law enforcement, and the strengthening of prevention and security, under the leadership of the national Government, the governors and mayors. Toward that end, the following activities will be conducted with a view to overcoming the insecurity in Colombian society: maintaining efforts to strengthen the systems of justice and law enforcement, as well as continuing to modernize the intelligence services, offering them the latest technologies, placing the highest priority on reforming the national police and modernizing the country\'s penitentiary system; strengthening prevention through comprehensive programmes for those at high-risk; continuing to consolidate the planning of security, justice and defence-related affairs in the country, to draw up policies and find resources within the framework of the National Development Plan; the Government will continue to call upon the community to cooperate with the authorities, conveying the message that the only way to attain greater security is through civil solidarity, with the State and society playing complementary roles.\n.The defence and promotion of human rights have been and remain a priority for the Government. The Government will continue its work of teaching and disseminating the fundamental rules of human rights and will strengthen its monitoring machinery both within and outside public institutions to prevent, investigate and punish any violations. Finally, the Government reports that as regards the death and disappearance of trade unionists in respect of whom it has not provided information, it has communicated their names to the Special Prosecutor and to the Chief Prosecutor with a view to obtaining information on the status of criminal and administrative proceedings under way.\n.As regards the allegations concerning violations of trade union rights at various enterprises, the Government reports the following:- BANK OF CALDAS - NATIONAL FEDERATION OF COFFEE GROWERS: the trade union filed suit in Bogot against the Bank of Caldas for infringement of the right of association. In addition, suits brought before the regular labour court by the workers covered by trade union immunity have to date resulted in various rulings in their favour. Consequently, the enterprise has had to pay the corresponding compensation along with other legal and contractual benefits. There are currently three claims of trade union immunity in the city of Manizales, and another in Armenia, related to this subject. The Ministry of Labour held to the legal position that the request to convene a binding arbitration court should not be granted, as the workers did not observe the requirements laid down in section  of Act No.  of ;- HOLGUIN STEEL GROUP: numerous workers were dismissed as a consequence of the economic crisis affecting the enterprise. The Ministry of Labour fined the enterprise for not having requested the appropriate authorization. The workers later held a work stoppage, which', 'a legal entity by virtue of its very establishment, as from the date of its constitutent assembly"".\n.As regards infringements of the right of freedom of association, they are defined as criminal acts and punished in accordance with the detailed provisions of section  of Act No.  of .

Let me know if you have any further requests.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['with attempts to undermine the democratic stability of the country. The events that occurred in Colombia in October  had nothing to do with a workers\' strike, but were an attempt of extreme left-wing movements to take advantage of various claims put forward by a number of trade union federations in order to carry out their plans to destabilise the country. The suspension of the legal personality of the last two trade union organisations affected by these measures was lifted in December .\n.As regards the persons dismissed for having taken part in the general strike, the Government reports that the National Institute of Cancer Research reinstated the persons dismissed; the San Juan de Dios hospital did not dismiss anyone; the Salt Mines Concession Company did not dismiss anyone; the Electricity Company of Cartagena did not dismiss anyone but issued warnings with suspensions depending upon the extent of participation in the strike; the Nestl Company dismissed  persons, but reached a conciliated settlement. The Atlantic Coast Electricity Corporation (CORELCA) dismissed  persons but a number of these were reinstated; CONALVIDRIOS dismissed  persons; the ""Central de Mezclas"" Company dismissed  persons. The Ministry may not take administrative decisions in these specific and individual cases; however, as part of its political action of reconcilation with the working class, it is studying the follow-up to decisions relating to the illegality of this work stoppage. The dismissed persons are entitled to bring action through the usual labour law channels or can use the trade union immunity procedures.\n.As concerns the persons who were detained at the time of the strike in October  in accordance with the Decrees issued by the Government to re-establish public law and order, the Government notes that: Gonzalo Gmez, Orlando Mesa and Edilberto Ramrez (Fedetex Trade Union - Medelln) were released within the statutory time-limits; Ligia Cceres (DANE Trade Union, member of FENALTRASE - Bogat) was released on  November  (the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation is carrying out inquiries into complaints raised concerning her alleged arbitrary arrest; it has sent copies to the Supreme Court of Justice so that this body might investigate alleged irregularities of members of the army in detaining her); Bernardo Blanco (FENOSTRA Trade Union - Ccuta) was released within the statutory time-limits; Josafat Tarazona (President of USITRAS - Bucaramanga) was released on  October ; Csar Carrillo (President, USO - Barrancabermeja) was released the same day on  October ; Eduardo Yand (Ingenio Mayaguez Trade Union, regional CUT of Valle), and Guillermo Chitn were released within the statutory time-limits; and Ramn Sinisterra (Ingenio Azucarero Trade Union, regional CUT of Valle) was released within the statutory time-limits. The Government ends by stating that no member of a trade union organisation has been detained for activities connected to the exercise of his or her trade union rights and freedom of association.\n.The Government points out that a number of trade union federations in Colombia did not take part in the national strike because, according to their own statements, it was political and not in the interest of workers themselves. On  October , four days after the strike, Jorge Carrillo Rojas handed in his resignation as President of the Workers\' Central Organisation (CUT), the association that called the strike, and accused extremists of having used the name of the CUT to forward its political purposes. He also acknowledged that during the strike on  October, rebellious groups stepped up their violent actions, clearly demonstrating that they were trying to take advantage of the work stoppage for their own purposes.\n.The Government also refers to the strike\'s economic repercussions on the country, listing the blowing up of bridges, attacks on various villages throughout the country, the destruction of overhead cables, the blowing up of electric pylons, sabotage of thermoelectric stations, etc., with losses amounting to thousands of millions of pesos.\n.In a separate enclosure, the Government indicates the stage reached in the investigations being carried out in Colombia to identify those responsible for the murders and alleged disappearances of persons listed in the two annexes to the Committee\'s th Report and to clarify when, where and how these events occurred. Aware of the difficulties in following-up inquiries into alleged violations of human rights and basic freedoms, the Government set up an Inter-Institutional Working Group (GTI) with a view to establishing institutional machinery able to keep more up to date with inquiries. The role of the GTI is to request information on the present stage of the investigations, accelerate those that have not been activated and prepare documentation to draft replies on the individual cases being considered. This Group is made up of: the Presidential Council for the Defence, Protection and Promotion of Human Rights; the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Labour; the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation with its delegates for human rights, the army, the police, the National Criminal Investigation Board and the Administrative Department of Security (DAS).\n.As regards the allegations concerning the request for legal personality submitted by the Trade Union of Workers of the Chamber of Commerce of Bogot, the Government states that article  of the national Constitution stipulates that: ""The right to strike, except in the public services, is guaranteed. The law shall regulate its exercise""; but the law provides for cases when strikes are illegal in the public services (section  of the Labour Code). Section  of the Code forbids strikes in the public services and lists, amongst other activities, the following: ""(a) services given in any branch of public authority; (b) services given in transport undertakings on land, sea, inland waterways, joint undertakings for the supply of water, the production of electrical energy and telecommunications; (c) services given in health establishments of any kind, such as hospitals and nursing homes; (d) services given in social assistance, charitable and welfare establishments, etc.""; however, what is most significant is the definition that this same legislation gives to public service (""any organised activity that sets out to meet the needs of general interest on a regular and continuous basis; in accordance with a special legal system, whether it is carried out by the State directly or indirectly, or by private individuals""). The Government adds that the Chamber of Commerce, a body under private law, has public duties, one of which is to keep the business register - a duty carried out only by this institution. This is a service in the business sector which cannot therefore be paralysed because it would cause an upheaval in the country\'s trade; these circumstances were pointed out to the persons concerned by the Legal Office and the Trade Union Regulations and Registration Section. In the list of observations, mention was made of the role exercised by the Chamber of Commerce and respective notes were made on the provisions contrary to labour legislation or labour law. In these circumstances, it is not possible to grant the right to strike to the trade union in question as this would be an infringement of the legislation banning strikes in a service of public utility since the legislature, in including this limitation, set out to protect the rights of the community.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the trade union official Ramrez Rivera was detained for seven days in the barracks of the th Military Brigade of Bucaramanga. He was later placed at the disposal of the Second Public Order Judge of this city; at present he is detained in yard No.  in the Bucaramanga District Prison. Ramrez Rivera is alive, he has received good treatment from the authorities to whom he is entrusted and is being detained whilst judicial investigations are being carried out by the competent magistrate into the allegations that he was involved in the traffic and manufacture of firearms exclusively reserved for the army. In other words, Ramrez Rivera is not missing on account of the aforementioned search of union premises, as claimed by a number of trade union organisations.\n.Once again, the Committee expresses its very serious concern at the high number of murders and disappearances of trade union leaders and unionists (more than  since ). Nevertheless, the Committee notes with interest that the Government has taken action concerning two basic recommendations upon which the Committee insisted: the adoption of vigorous measures at the national level to dismantle the so-called paramilitary groups active throughout the country, and the adoption of the necessary measures to strengthen substantially the human and financial resources of the judiciary (see th Report, para. ). In this respect, the Committee had noted, at its May  meeting, the contents of Decrees Nos. ,  and  of  April  that establish a high-level commission mandated to evaluate and co-ordinate actions against the death squads and other groups of hired assassins and of ""private justice"", as well a Special Armed Corps comprised of , members of the National Police, to fight these groups; furthermore, under these Decrees the population\'s collaboration with the armed', 'Bello (Department of Antioquia); Puerto Lpez, San Martn and Puerto Gaitn (Meta); Bogot and Pacho (Cundinamarca); Valledupar (Cesar); Sincelejo (Sucre); Cali (Valle) and Cimitarra and Puerto Parra (Santander). Finally, the Director of the strongest state security body in the country informed the general public ""... that there have been quite significant signs. The struggle is continuing. The Colombian authorities have taken action and are continuing to do so with expedience to come to grips with these centres of terrorism and to dismantle the gangs of organised criminals who, we repeat, have murdered many persons belonging to the Colombian trade unionist movement"".\n.The Government also states that given the situation of violence, it was considered necessary to set up a special jurisdiction to deal with these cases and the executive was granted extraordinary powers to carry out a full reform of the legal system. The Government has made great efforts to increase funds and during the next few weeks, there will be a considerable outlay to strengthen the human and financial sources of the judiciary. Public order judges were created, as well as a Tribunal under this same jurisdiction. Since , this Government, given the need to adopt measures to protect the life, personal integrity and exercise of constitutional and political rights of Colombian citizens, has taken steps to strengthen the judiciary; it was for this reason that it issued Decree No.  of  (a copy is provided), with a view to establishing public order judges ""... to examine conduct punishable under the Penal Code, when this is intended to persecute or intimidate persons throughout the national territory, on account of their beliefs or political opinions, whether partisans or not"". Later, the Government introduced further measures aimed at strengthening Higher Judicial District Courts and public order magistrates to facilitate the judgement of those crimes that particularly undermine public law and order. For instance, it issued Decree No.  of  which provided for the setting up of Public Order Courts within the Higher Judicial District Courts. Decree No.  of  March  set up a special jurisdiction for the maintenance of law and order; this was supplemented by Decree No.  of  November  and Decrees Nos.  and  of  (copies are also provided). Decree No.  of  June , supplements Legislative Decree No.  of  and deals with penalties for new types of criminal action; this is considered necessary in order to combat death squadrons, gangs of hired assassins, self-defence or private justice groups. In application of these standards, many investigations are being carried out concerning members of these groups who are operating outside the law. To date, mass murders are on the decline. Although this is not enough, these are positive steps by the Government in its action to come to grips with and overcome the impunity enjoyed by the authors of these reprehensible acts.\n.The Government goes on to state that during the past few days, steps have been taken to appoint magistrates to assist regular judges at the Public Order Tribunal, as well as accountants for these judges. The Government will take this decision under a Decree of state of seige. In accordance with the above-mentioned Decree, each judge will be granted an assistant, as well as accountants that can participate in summary investigations, because this institution is overloaded trying to implement the special decrees issued to put an end to drug trafficking. Under Decree No.  of  August , the Security Fund of the Judiciary was set up (a copy is provided) with a view to financing the safety and protection of judges in the Republic in view of the persistent attacks on members of the judiciary by armed groups and organisations connected with drug trafficking. At present, various methods are being put into practice with this objective of protecting judges, such as special training for their bodyguards and the purchase of equipment for their physical protection. The Government is also taking steps to try and commit other countries to participate in this attempt to strengthen and protect magistrates.\n.Referring to the allegations of acts of violence against trade unionists and trade union headquarters, the Government submits official statistical data. The wave of violence that has affected a large number of trade unionists has been concentrated in the areas of Urab (Antioquia), Barrancabermeja and its vicinity (Santander) and the municipality of San Alberto (Cesar), because a number of the major recognised trade unions are found in these areas; these include the Agricultural Workers\' Trade Union of Urab (Antioquia), the Workers\' Trade Union (USO) in Barrancabermeja (Santander) and the Trade Union of Workers in the Palm Industry (INDUPALMA) in San Alberto (Cesar). The breakdown of the number of victims amongst trade unionists in the areas mentioned above is from January  onwards, as follows: in the Urab area,  murders; in Barrancabermeja,  murders; in San Alberto,  murders.\n.Furthermore, there have been  murders in the rest of the country, making a total of  murders of trade union officials and trade union members during the past three years. During the same period, there have been  attacks with dynamite perpetrated against trade union headquarters. Differences in statistics are due to criteria of assessment and analysis as to what are considered criminal offences and political violence resulting from extreme left-wing and right-wing terrorism; many murders of trade unionists have been criminal offences. It should, however, be pointed out that a high percentage of these cases (both murders and attacks) occurred during ; in  figures dropped by approximately  per cent and during , by  per cent. This indicates a considerable decline in the number of murders, a result of the measures adopted by the Government to protect the life and integrity of trade unionists. Once again, the Government reiterates that its attitude is directed not only to respect for but defence of the rights of workers. It has been and still is a basic priority for the Government to protect the life and integrity not only of trade unionists but of all individuals throughout the country.\n.Concerning the strike of  October , the Government states that the situation of law and order in Colombia is problematic and conditions since October  have been particularly serious. The Government states that it was not opposed to a workers\' strike in October , conducted by workers to promote the interest of workers. The same trade unionists themselves claimed that the strike was a pretext to destabilise the country\'s democratic institutions. The measures that the Government was forced to take to guarantee the stability of the democratic institutions and to maintain public peace were taken in accordance with the provisions of the national Constitution, stipulating that exceptional measures may be taken in emergency situations or a state of seige. They were only taken to deal with attempts to undermine the country\'s democratic stability and, once the danger was over, the national Government lifted these measures. In view of the conditions of law and order prevailing and the serious terrorist acts that were being committed and planned, the Government felt that the only way to deal with the public emergency and preserve the higher values of a democratic society was to suspend temporarily a number of guarantees.\n.The Government issued Decree No.  of , concerning the arrest of persons who had suppported the strike, and Decree No.  of , concerning the suspension of the legal personality of trade union organisations. The Decrees were submitted to the control of the Supreme Court of Justice which, having heard the favourable opinion of the Attorney-General of the Nation - an official who fulfils the role of the Swedish ""ombudsman"", the French ""mediateur"" or North American ""General Attorney"" in Colombia - found them in accordance with the national Constitution. The Government points out that decrees of this nature are in conformity with those provided for in the American Convention on Human Rights, the Covenant of San Jos of  November , the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations of  December  and the International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations.\n.Acting within the extraordinary powers conferred upon it by the political Constitution, the Government temporarily suspended, on the basis of Decree No.  of , the legal personality of trade union organisations in sectors where there had been the greatest upheaval. A number of trade unions appealed through administrative channels, and the State Council provisionally suspended the penalties - not because the Government had overstepped its rights by applying them, but because they had been pronounced after the Government had voluntarily repealed the Decree upon which these measures were based. It is necessary to point out that once the internal unrest had quietened down, the Government repealed the Decrees it had taken to deal with the situation. This was a decision that clearly demonstrates the democratic structure of the Colombian Government. Exceptional measures were only taken to cope', 'with attempts to undermine the democratic stability of the country. The events that occurred in Colombia in October  had nothing to do with a workers\' strike, but were an attempt of extreme left-wing movements to take advantage of various claims put forward by a number of trade union federations in order to carry out their plans to destabilise the country. The suspension of the legal personality of the last two trade union organisations affected by these measures was lifted in December .\n.As regards the persons dismissed for having taken part in the general strike, the Government reports that the National Institute of Cancer Research reinstated the persons dismissed; the San Juan de Dios hospital did not dismiss anyone; the Salt Mines Concession Company did not dismiss anyone; the Electricity Company of Cartagena did not dismiss anyone but issued warnings with suspensions depending upon the extent of participation in the strike; the Nestl Company dismissed  persons, but reached a conciliated settlement. The Atlantic Coast Electricity Corporation (CORELCA) dismissed  persons but a number of these were reinstated; CONALVIDRIOS dismissed  persons; the ""Central de Mezclas"" Company dismissed  persons. The Ministry may not take administrative decisions in these specific and individual cases; however, as part of its political action of reconcilation with the working class, it is studying the follow-up to decisions relating to the illegality of this work stoppage. The dismissed persons are entitled to bring action through the usual labour law channels or can use the trade union immunity procedures.\n.As concerns the persons who were detained at the time of the strike in October  in accordance with the Decrees issued by the Government to re-establish public law and order, the Government notes that: Gonzalo Gmez, Orlando Mesa and Edilberto Ramrez (Fedetex Trade Union - Medelln) were released within the statutory time-limits; Ligia Cceres (DANE Trade Union, member of FENALTRASE - Bogat) was released on  November  (the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation is carrying out inquiries into complaints raised concerning her alleged arbitrary arrest; it has sent copies to the Supreme Court of Justice so that this body might investigate alleged irregularities of members of the army in detaining her); Bernardo Blanco (FENOSTRA Trade Union - Ccuta) was released within the statutory time-limits; Josafat Tarazona (President of USITRAS - Bucaramanga) was released on  October ; Csar Carrillo (President, USO - Barrancabermeja) was released the same day on  October ; Eduardo Yand (Ingenio Mayaguez Trade Union, regional CUT of Valle), and Guillermo Chitn were released within the statutory time-limits; and Ramn Sinisterra (Ingenio Azucarero Trade Union, regional CUT of Valle) was released within the statutory time-limits. The Government ends by stating that no member of a trade union organisation has been detained for activities connected to the exercise of his or her trade union rights and freedom of association.\n.The Government points out that a number of trade union federations in Colombia did not take part in the national strike because, according to their own statements, it was political and not in the interest of workers themselves. On  October , four days after the strike, Jorge Carrillo Rojas handed in his resignation as President of the Workers\' Central Organisation (CUT), the association that called the strike, and accused extremists of having used the name of the CUT to forward its political purposes. He also acknowledged that during the strike on  October, rebellious groups stepped up their violent actions, clearly demonstrating that they were trying to take advantage of the work stoppage for their own purposes.\n.The Government also refers to the strike\'s economic repercussions on the country, listing the blowing up of bridges, attacks on various villages throughout the country, the destruction of overhead cables, the blowing up of electric pylons, sabotage of thermoelectric stations, etc., with losses amounting to thousands of millions of pesos.\n.In a separate enclosure, the Government indicates the stage reached in the investigations being carried out in Colombia to identify those responsible for the murders and alleged disappearances of persons listed in the two annexes to the Committee\'s th Report and to clarify when, where and how these events occurred. Aware of the difficulties in following-up inquiries into alleged violations of human rights and basic freedoms, the Government set up an Inter-Institutional Working Group (GTI) with a view to establishing institutional machinery able to keep more up to date with inquiries. The role of the GTI is to request information on the present stage of the investigations, accelerate those that have not been activated and prepare documentation to draft replies on the individual cases being considered. This Group is made up of: the Presidential Council for the Defence, Protection and Promotion of Human Rights; the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Labour; the Office of the Attorney-General of the Nation with its delegates for human rights, the army, the police, the National Criminal Investigation Board and the Administrative Department of Security (DAS).\n.As regards the allegations concerning the request for legal personality submitted by the Trade Union of Workers of the Chamber of Commerce of Bogot, the Government states that article  of the national Constitution stipulates that: ""The right to strike, except in the public services, is guaranteed. The law shall regulate its exercise""; but the law provides for cases when strikes are illegal in the public services (section  of the Labour Code). Section  of the Code forbids strikes in the public services and lists, amongst other activities, the following: ""(a) services given in any branch of public authority; (b) services given in transport undertakings on land, sea, inland waterways, joint undertakings for the supply of water, the production of electrical energy and telecommunications; (c) services given in health establishments of any kind, such as hospitals and nursing homes; (d) services given in social assistance, charitable and welfare establishments, etc.""; however, what is most significant is the definition that this same legislation gives to public service (""any organised activity that sets out to meet the needs of general interest on a regular and continuous basis; in accordance with a special legal system, whether it is carried out by the State directly or indirectly, or by private individuals""). The Government adds that the Chamber of Commerce, a body under private law, has public duties, one of which is to keep the business register - a duty carried out only by this institution. This is a service in the business sector which cannot therefore be paralysed because it would cause an upheaval in the country\'s trade; these circumstances were pointed out to the persons concerned by the Legal Office and the Trade Union Regulations and Registration Section. In the list of observations, mention was made of the role exercised by the Chamber of Commerce and respective notes were made on the provisions contrary to labour legislation or labour law. In these circumstances, it is not possible to grant the right to strike to the trade union in question as this would be an infringement of the legislation banning strikes in a service of public utility since the legislature, in including this limitation, set out to protect the rights of the community.\n.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the trade union official Ramrez Rivera was detained for seven days in the barracks of the th Military Brigade of Bucaramanga. He was later placed at the disposal of the Second Public Order Judge of this city; at present he is detained in yard No.  in the Bucaramanga District Prison. Ramrez Rivera is alive, he has received good treatment from the authorities to whom he is entrusted and is being detained whilst judicial investigations are being carried out by the competent magistrate into the allegations that he was involved in the traffic and manufacture of firearms exclusively reserved for the army. In other words, Ramrez Rivera is not missing on account of the aforementioned search of union premises, as claimed by a number of trade union organisations.\n.Once again, the Committee expresses its very serious concern at the high number of murders and disappearances of trade union leaders and unionists (more than  since ). Nevertheless, the Committee notes with interest that the Government has taken action concerning two basic recommendations upon which the Committee insisted: the adoption of vigorous measures at the national level to dismantle the so-called paramilitary groups active throughout the country, and the adoption of the necessary measures to strengthen substantially the human and financial resources of the judiciary (see th Report, para. ). In this respect, the Committee had noted, at its May  meeting, the contents of Decrees Nos. ,  and  of  April  that establish a high-level commission mandated to evaluate and co-ordinate actions against the death squads and other groups of hired assassins and of ""private justice"", as well a Special Armed Corps comprised of , members of the National Police, to fight these groups; furthermore, under these Decrees the population\'s collaboration with the armed']"

This being the case, the Committee again requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the above legal proceedings and to send a copy of the decisions made.\n.With regard to subparagraph (l) of the recommendations concerning disciplinary measures against members of SINALTRABAVARIA, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the ordinary legal proceedings brought by the workers concerned were resolved in one case in favour of the company and in the other in favour of the plaintiff. In the latter case, the Committee notes the Government s statement that damages were duly paid to the worker and that all the legal proceedings brought against Bavaria S.A. in this regard were thereby exhausted. The Committee also notes the information supplied by the Government that, in situations of this nature, a trade union has recourse to administrative and legal channels to uphold any rights it feels have been infringed, noting that the administrative authorities monitor and control compliance with labour law, while the legal authorities consider controversies which merit value judgements in order finally to establish how a right should be recognized.\n.With regard to subparagraph (m) of the recommendations concerning anti-union discrimination presented by SINALTRABAVARIA (pressure on workers to resign from the trade union, denial of trade union leave, delay on the part of the Ministry of Social Protection in carrying out inspections to confirm anti-union activities in the enterprise and in the registration of new executive committees, and the hiring by the enterprise as a labour cooperative of workers that it had previously dismissed), the Committee notes the Government s statement with regard to pressure on workers to resign from the trade union that, as yet, the union has been unable to prove its claims, since there exists neither a verdict convicting the company nor an administrative decision sanctioning the company for the aforementioned pressure. The Committee recalls that no person should be dismissed or prejudiced in his or her employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities, and it is important to forbid and penalize in practice all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of employment [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure the full application of this principle.\n.With regard to the allegations concerning the denial of trade union leave, the Committee notes the Government s statement that Bavaria S.A. has not been convicted of the alleged denial of trade union leave. The Committee observes that the Government does not clearly specify whether proceedings have been brought against the company in this regard and, if so, whether they found in favour of the company. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect. In any event, the Committee recalls that, in accordance with paragraph  of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), workers' representatives should be afforded the necessary time for carrying out their representation functions and that, while workers' representatives may be required to obtain permission from the management before taking time off, such permission should not be unreasonably withheld [see Digest, op. cit., para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure respect for these principles in the future.\n.With regard to the delay on the part of the Ministry of Social Protection in dealing with matters brought to its attention, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the Ministry has fulfilled its duties and obligations in accordance with the powers given to it in law, but that, on various occasions, complaints have been archived through lack of legal interest on the part of the trade union.\n.With regard to the registration of trade union executive committees, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that trade unions must act within the law and their own statutes, and that, if they do not, then they cannot be taken to be legally constituted by the Ministry of Social Protection, but that, nevertheless, the members of such bodies can form new bodies by fulfilling the legal requirements. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government and information supplied by Bavaria S.A., no cooperatives formed by dismissed staff are operating at the company.\n.With regard to subparagraph (o) of the recommendations concerning the failure to implement the Committee s recommendation for the reinstatement of or payment of full compensation to Mr. Romero, the Committee notes that, in its verdict of  June , the Upper Tribunal of Medelln ordered the company to pay Mr. Jaime Rodrigo Romero Gonzlez the sum of $,, in damages for wrongful dismissal and $,,. in indexing, a decision which was confirmed by the Labour Annulment Division of the Supreme Court of Justice on  September . Consequently, on  November , once all the legal processes had been completed, the company, complying with the verdict of the Upper Tribunal of Medelln, proceeded to pay the amounts owed in damages and indexing, to which had been added payment of costs.\n.In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) With regard to the alleged dismissing and sanctioning of workers belonging to SINALTRABAVARIA for participating in a strike at the company on  August , the Committee recalls that justice delayed is justice denied and requests the Government to take the necessary measures to expedite the judicial procedure under way and to continue to keep it informed of the results of the actions and proceedings brought.(b) With regard to the dismissal of trade union officers at the Caja de Crdito Agrario, in disregard of trade union immunity and in contravention of the rulings ordering the reinstatement of a number of these officers, with regard to which the Council of State considered in a resolution that the individual rights of the applicants were safeguarded by acknowledgement of the arrears of wages owed from the time the posts were abolished until the notification of an administrative act setting out the reasons why reinstatement was not possible, the Committee requests the Government to take the measures necessary to ensure, bearing in mind the time elapsed, that the procedures still to be completed for payment of salaries and benefits to the remaining workers are finalized quickly, and to keep it informed in this regard.(c) With regard to the refusal to register the trade union organizations USITAC, SINALTRABET and UNITAS on grounds of legal flaws, the Committee recalls that, although the founders of a trade union should comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to impair the free establishment of organizations and requests the Government to take measures to ensure that, as soon as the minimum requirements are fulfilled, the authorities proceed with registration of the trade unions USITAC, SINALTRABET and UNITAS.(d) With regard to the actions taken by the enterprise in order to suspend the trade union immunity of William de Jess Puerta Cano, Jos Everardo Rodas, Alberto Ruiz and Jorge William Restrepo, the Committee requests the Government to inform it as to whether the union officials have been finally dismissed and to give the reasons for such action being taken.(e) With regard to the alleged subsequent dismissal without cause of SINALTRAINBEC officials and founders of the Trade Union of Workers in the Beverages and Foodstuffs Industry (USTIBEA), who also include William de Jess Puerta Cano, together with Luis Fernando Viana Pario, Edgar Daro Castrilln Munera and Alberto de Jess Bedoya Ros, on the grounds of serious disciplinary offences, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to ensure that an independent investigation is carried out to establish whether these dismissals took place following suspension of trade union immunity, and bearing in mind that, according to the information supplied by the Government, workers can only be reinstated once they have begun the appropriate legal action, to keep it informed of any legal action begun or cases brought with this aim. The Committee recalls that, if the competent authorities determine that the dismissals were of an anti-union nature, the unionists in question should be reinstated in their posts.(f) As regards the legal impossibility to form industry unions grouping workers of various types of industry, the Committee recalls that, in conformity with Article  of Convention No. , workers have the right to form organizations of their own choosing and consequently it is for workers to determine the union structure they desire.(g) With regard to the dismissal of members of the complainant organization SINALTRAINBEC, and the early retirement schemes adopted by the company and accepted by some members, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any legal proceedings brought in respect of these measures.(h) With regard to the closure of the COLENVASES plant, leading to the dismissal of  workers and seven union officials without trade union immunity being suspended and without complying with the Ministry of Labour s resolution"", 'labour court ultimately to decide whether or not those dismissed are to be reinstated;(f) the ETB states that it complied with the ruling of Bogot Circuit Court No.  for Labour and the Judicial District Labour High Court with regard to the reinstatement of Jorge Ignacio Ayala Benavides. The employee was reinstated in a job similar to that which he had had when he was dismissed and he received unpaid wages covering the period from the date of dismissal until his reinstatement. Moreover, since his reinstatement he has continued to benefit from the same wage and benefits conditions laid down in the collective labour agreement signed between SINTRATELEFONOS and ETB and applicable to him at the time of his dismissal;(g) regarding those who did not accept the conciliation proposal of the enterprise, this occurred for economic reasons as those concerned did not agree with the amount offered;(h) regarding the cases of Flor Alba Prez, Gladys Prez, Jorge Alejandro Snchez, Alvaro Miguel Vsquez and Arcadio Virviescas, who were dismissed in , the ETB states that as a result of restructuring in  it was necessary to cut some positions with the resulting unilateral termination of labour contracts with a number of people, among them those mentioned in the complaint. This termination was based on the collective labour agreement, clause , and the Substantive Labour Code. The former workers began labour proceedings in the ordinary courts and these are under way. The ETB adds that, to date, Jorge Ivn Castaeda is still with the enterprise and Martha Querales was laid off with the appropriate compensation and benefits. Finally, the ETB states that regarding the cases of Gustavo Albarracin Villegas, Martha Yaneth Contreras, Ricardo Alberto Lpez, Adelina Molina de Crdenas and William Alberto Quevedo Ramrez, their employment was terminated with just cause and in accordance with the collective labour agreement and the law. The workers lodged an action for protection of constitutional rights (tutela proceedings), which was unsuccessful;(i) regarding the status of Elias Quintana and Carlos Socha, the ETB states that these men do not seem to be registered in their archives as workers;(j) regarding the disciplinary proceedings, the ETB states that two disciplinary proceedings were begun against Rafael Galvis, Germn Rodrguez and Sandra Cordero, one for violence against the vehicle transporting the president of the enterprise, in which no sanctions were imposed through application of article  of Law No.  of , according to which, all reasonable doubt shall favour the person accused when there is no way of removing this. The other disciplinary proceedings relates to preventing workers from entering the workplace, in which Rafael Galvis and Sandra Cordero were subject to disciplinary measures. In both proceedings they were allowed a representative to act for them, which shows that due process was respected. However, the ETB states that the behaviour investigated in these disciplinary proceedings bears no relation to the motives upon which were based the dismissals with just cause that took place on  November . Finally, the ETB states that Rodrigo Acosta was not the subject of an inquiry nor was he subject to disciplinary measures;(k) the ETB states that, for security reasons, there is restricted entrance to some areas, such as telephone operator services, general distribution, computing centres and the CAOM (Centre for Administration, Operations and Maintenance of Exchange and Transmission), among others. This restriction applies to all enterprise staff; and(l) regarding the pay-out of the performance bonus, this payment was based on achieving the goals established for .\n.The Committee observes that, when it examined this case at its March  meeting, it requested the Government to take action on a number of allegations. Specifically, the Committee requested the Government: () to keep it informed of the outcome of the legal proceedings initiated by Ms. Adelina Molina de Crdenas and of the judicial proceedings relating to the  trade union members dismissed in  from the Bogot Telecommunications Enterprise (ETB) and, should the ruling call for the reinstatement of the workers, to ensure that this was complied with; () to send observations on the disciplinary proceedings against the entire trade union executive committee of SINTRATELEFONOS for - and the dismissal of Martha Querales and Jorge Ivn Castaeda for reporting corruption among members of the management of the ETB. The Committee requested the complainants to supply more precise information on whether the trade union officials Elas Quintana and Carlos Socha -- dismissed according to the complainants -- were workers of the ETB and to indicate the name of the member of SINTRAELECOL who was dismissed from the Bogot Power Company. The Committee also observes that SINTRATELEFONOS has presented new allegations relating to the following points:(a) excesssive delays in the judicial proceedings;(b) the  trade union members (including three trade union officials, Rafael Humberto Galvis, Rodrigo H. Acosta and Sandra P. Cordero) have not been reinstated and on  April the Constitutional Court reversed the ruling for protection of constitutional rights (tutela) that ordered that the majority of workers be reinstated, including the trade union officials who had been elected to the trade union executive committee. Of these  workers, seven (Germn Rodrguez, Alfredo Tarazona, Bernardo Hernndez, Serafn Gmez, Josu Moiss Carrasco, Orlando Chingate Cabrera and Guillermo Ferreira) took early retirement, while the three trade union officials and ten workers refused it. Furthermore, Sandra P. Cordero, Rafael H. Galvis Jaramillo and Rodrigo H. Acosta were subjected to an increase in disciplinary proceedings aimed at demonstrating just cause for dismissal and were restricted in their access to certain areas of the enterprise as well as to meetings with workers;(c) the Office of the Procurator-General of the Nation ordered that the sale of the ETB be halted because of serious irregularities; this had already been reported by the complainant organization, which led to the dismissals;(d) the Ministry of Labour repealed resolutions Nos.  and  of  October , which declared the work stoppages of  illegal and which also gave rise to the dismissals. In spite of the fact that there is no longer any legal basis for these dismissals, the enterprise refuses to reinstate the workers (it has only reinstated Jorge Ayala, placing him in a job that differs from his previous one, and Hernando Casallas and Hernando Lpez, on a temporary basis);(e) the judicial proceedings have been postponed and there is no ruling on that basis;(f) the following have still not been reinstated: Flor Alba Prez, Gladys Prez, Jorge Alejandro Snchez, Alvaro Miguel Vsquez and Arcadio Virviescas, workers at the Engativa Office of the ETB who were dismissed in January , Martha Querales and Jorge Ivn Castaeda for reporting corruption among members of the management of the ETB, and Gustavo Albarracn Villegas, Martha Yaneth Contreras, Ricardo Alberto Lpez, Adelina Molina de Crdenas, William Alberto Quevedo Ramrez, and Amparo Zapata Valderrama, from the commercial division;(g) the breaches of the collective agreement in paying out the performance bonus in an unfair way which benefited workers not belonging to a trade union, in denying retroactive redundancy compensation and in replacing employees with contract workers;(h) the release of the main suspect in the murder of Dr. Eduardo Umaa Mendoza, legal adviser of SINTRATELEFONOS.\n.With regard to the judicial proceedings begun by Ms. Adelina Molina de Crdenas, the Committee notes that the Government states that this is in the preliminary stages and that when questioned Ms. Adelina Molina de Crdenas acknowledged that she stated that she was pregnant following her dismissal and that the ETB confirms that the grounds used to dismiss her were not related to her pregnancy.\n.With regard to the allegations relating to the  trade union members belonging to SINTRATELEFONOS dismissed by the ETB, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government according to which seven conciliation procedures took place freely and voluntarily (in the cases of Germn Rodrguez, Alfredo Tarazona, Bernardo Hernndez, Serafn Gmez, Josu Moiss Carrasco, Orlando Chingate Cabrera and Guillermo Ferreira) and that the remaining legal procedures are in the preliminary stages, including those of the three trade union officials. Moreover, the Committee notes the Government s statement that resolutions Nos.  and , which declared the work stoppages that took place in  illegal and which led to the dismissals, were repealed but that the ETB declares that it is for a labour court ultimately to determine whether or not those dismissed are to be reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to let it know whether the ETB has begun legal proceedings and, if this is not the case, that the dismissed workers be immediately reinstated and receive their unpaid salaries. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.\n.Regarding the situation of Jorge Ignacio Ayala Benavides who, according to the allegations, was reinstated in a different job from that which he had held previously, the Committee notes the Government s statement that in accordance with the ruling of Circuit Court No.  the worker was reinstated in a position of similar category, that he was paid the wages owing to him and that', 'them those mentioned in the complaint. This termination was based on the collective labour agreement, clause , and the Substantive Labour Code. The former workers began labour proceedings in the ordinary courts and these are under way. The ETB adds that, to date, Jorge Ivn Castaeda is still with the enterprise and Martha Querales was laid off with the appropriate compensation and benefits. Finally, the ETB states that regarding the cases of Gustavo Albarracin Villegas, Martha Yaneth Contreras, Ricardo Alberto Lpez, Adelina Molina de Crdenas and William Alberto Quevedo Ramrez, their employment was terminated with just cause and in accordance with the collective labour agreement and the law.

Acosta were subjected to an increase in disciplinary proceedings aimed at demonstrating just cause for dismissal and were restricted in their access to certain areas of the enterprise as well as to meetings with workers;(c) the Office of the Procurator-General of the Nation ordered that the sale of the ETB be halted because of serious irregularities; this had already been reported by the complainant organization, which led to the dismissals;(d) the Ministry of Labour repealed resolutions Nos.  and  of  October , which declared the work stoppages of  illegal and which also gave rise to the dismissals. In spite of the fact that there is no longer any legal basis for these dismissals, the enterprise refuses to reinstate the workers (it has only reinstated Jorge Ayala, placing him in a job that differs from his previous one, and Hernando Casallas and Hernando Lpez, on a temporary basis);(e) the judicial proceedings have been postponed and there is no ruling on that basis;(f) the following have still not been reinstated: Flor Alba Prez, Gladys Prez, Jorge Alejandro Snchez, Alvaro Miguel Vsquez and Arcadio Virviescas, workers at the Engativa Office of the ETB who were dismissed in January , Martha Querales and Jorge Ivn Castaeda for reporting corruption among members of the management of the ETB, and Gustavo Albarracn Villegas, Martha Yaneth Contreras, Ricardo Alberto Lpez, Adelina Molina de Crdenas, William Alberto Quevedo Ramrez, and Amparo Zapata Valderrama, from the commercial division;(g) the breaches of the collective agreement in paying out the performance bonus in an unfair way which benefited workers not belonging to a trade union, in denying retroactive redundancy compensation and in replacing employees with contract workers;(h) the release of the main suspect in the murder of Dr. Eduardo Umaa Mendoza, legal adviser of SINTRATELEFONOS.\n.With regard to the judicial proceedings begun by Ms. Adelina Molina de Crdenas, the Committee notes that the Government states that this is in the preliminary stages and that when questioned Ms. Adelina Molina de Crdenas acknowledged that she stated that she was pregnant following her dismissal and that the ETB confirms that the grounds used to dismiss her were not related to her pregnancy.\n.With regard to the allegations relating to the  trade union members belonging to SINTRATELEFONOS dismissed by the ETB, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government according to which seven conciliation procedures took place freely and voluntarily (in the cases of Germn Rodrguez, Alfredo Tarazona, Bernardo Hernndez, Serafn Gmez, Josu Moiss Carrasco, Orlando Chingate Cabrera and Guillermo Ferreira) and that the remaining legal procedures are in the preliminary stages, including those of the three trade union officials. Moreover, the Committee notes the Government s statement that resolutions Nos.  and , which declared the work stoppages that took place in  illegal and which led to the dismissals, were repealed but that the ETB declares that it is for a labour court ultimately to determine whether or not those dismissed are to be reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to let it know whether the ETB has begun legal proceedings and, if this is not the case, that the dismissed workers be immediately reinstated and receive their unpaid salaries. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments.\n.Regarding the situation of Jorge Ignacio Ayala Benavides who, according to the allegations, was reinstated in a different job from that which he had held previously, the Committee notes the Government s statement that in accordance with the ruling of Circuit Court No.  the worker was reinstated in a position of similar category, that he was paid the wages owing to him and that he is covered by the provisions laid down in the collective labour agreement.\n.Regarding the disciplinary proceedings begun against the trade union officers, the Committee notes the Government s statement that one of these proceedings relates to violence against the vehicle transporting the president of the enterprise but that no disciplinary measures were taken and the other relates to Rafael Galvis and Sandra Cordero, who were subjected to disciplinary measures for preventing workers from entering the workplace, and that according to the Government these processes had no bearing on the dismissals of  November  and that on both occasions the defendants\' right to a defence was guaranteed. The Committee also notes that, according to the enterprise, the restricted entry to some areas of the enterprise applied to all staff. The Committee recalls that ""governments should guarantee access of trade union representatives to workplaces, with due respect for the rights of property and management, so that trade unions can communicate with workers, in order to apprise them of the potential advantages of unionization"" [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, th edition, , para. ]. The Committee requests the Government to ensure that this principle is fully respected.\n.Regarding']"

The Committee notes that the Government indicates in particular that: (i) by means of resolution No.  of , the Threats Group has been established within the Specialized Directorate against Human Rights Violations that currently has ten public prosecutors responsible for supporting the Sectional Directorates where threats against the target population of this strategy are being made; and (ii) the Public Prosecutor s Office has developed a specific strategy and designated a specialist public prosecutor from the National Working Group on Threats to investigate threats against trade unionists in the mining and energy sector in Valle del Cauca as a matter of priority\n.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government and welcomes in particular the continuation and strengthening of efforts to guarantee that the investigation and resolution of all acts of anti-union violence and the punishment of the perpetrators constitutes a State priority carried out by methods appropriate for the types of crimes in question and through broad inter-institutional coordination. The Committee also takes note of the progress reported in the investigations of the specific acts of anti-union violence reported in the framework of this case and the homicides reported by the Prosecutor General s Office in . At the same time, the Committee again notes the lack of information about the investigation and punishment of the potential instigators of those crimes. The Committee once again emphasizes in this regard that the investigations should focus not only on the individual perpetrator of the crime but also its instigators, with the aim of ensuring that justice is fully done and significantly preventing future acts of violence against trade union members. While welcoming the significant action taken by the competent authorities, the Committee urges the Government to continue strengthening its efforts to ensure that all the acts of anti-union violence, homicides, threats and other acts reported in the country are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted. The Committee particularly hopes that all further steps will be taken and all necessary resources committed in order to ensure that the investigations and criminal procedures relating to the acts of anti-union violence reported in this case are made significantly more effective in identifying and punishing the instigators. The Committee once again requests the Government to provide detailed information in this regard.\n.Concerning the steps taken by the public authorities to prevent acts of anti-union violence and protect trade union members at risk, the Committee takes note, first, of the quantitative data provided by the Government, which indicates that: (i)  members of the trade union movement were protected in  (of which  with strict protection measures) and, with data available up to  November ,  members of the trade union movement received protection in  (of which  with strict protection measures); and (ii) the UNP had a budget of ,,,,. Colombian pesos in  (approximately US$ million), compared to ,,,. pesos in . The Committee also notes that the Government states that: (i) in the framework of the Timely Action Plan (PAO) for individual and collective prevention and protection of the rights to life, liberty, integrity and security for human rights defenders, social and community leaders and journalists, the PAO Operating Committee for protection and immediate response to infringements of the rights to life, integrity, liberty and security has been established, and that, in that framework, there are  priority municipalities for operations, with proposals to add a further  municipalities; (ii) there have been collective risk assessments for six  population groups with accredited status as trade union leaders or activists' (four risk assessments have been finalized and two are active); and (iii) the Ministry of Labour continues to lead the Technical Secretariat of the Inter-Institutional Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights, which held three sessions in , one of which had a focus on difficulties faced by working women and gender issues.\n.The Committee commends the significant efforts of the competent authorities to protect against anti-union violence. The Committee takes particular note in this regard of the significant increase in the budget of the UNP and the regular consultations held with the social partners in the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights. At the same time, the Committee takes note with deep concern of the  homicides of trade unionists reported by the Government in , events that indicate the persistence of a serious situation of anti-union violence in the country. The Committee recalls in this regard that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Compilation of decisions of the Freedom of Association Committee, sixth edition , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to continue strengthening its efforts to afford adequate protection to members of the trade union movement exposed to risk. With a view to ensuring that the policies to prevent anti-union violence achieve greater impact, the Committee particularly urges the Government to: (i) in the framework of the institutional initiatives and forums for the protection of human rights defenders and social leaders, continue to give the necessary attention to the specific situation of members of the trade union movement at risk; and (ii) provide updated information about the measures taken to prevent acts of anti-union violence in the main risk areas at the regional and sectoral level, which the Government brought to the attention of the Committee at its previous examination of the case (see rd Report, para. ). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.With regard to the wounds suffered in  by Mr Oscar Arturo Orozco, member of the SINTRAELECOL union, the Committee takes note that the Government: (i) recalls that it had noted that the investigation into the crime of wounding was progressing at the Caldas Sectional Directorate; and (ii) states that, according to the Public Prosecutor s Office, the public prosecutor in the case issued a decision to close the case. With regard to the threats reported in  by Mr Oscar Lema Vega, the Committee notes that the Government states that the investigation was provisionally closed as a result of the inability to identify or establish an active suspect.\n.With regard to the facts reported by the Union of Cali Municipal Enterprise Workers (SINTRAEMCALI) the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that the Public Prosecutor s Office began an investigation into the events leading to the arson against the motor vehicle belonging to Mr Jos Ernesto Reyes; on the basis of these events it was decided to close the proceedings as no active suspect for the crime could be identified or singled out. The Government emphasizes in this regard that, with cases that are closed as a result of the inability to identify or establish an active suspect, once new information or conducive, pertinent and useful evidence is obtained, the case can be reopened and proceedings resumed.\n.The Committee notes with regret the lack of identification and punishment for the perpetrators of these serious crimes. The Committee recalls that, in cases of physical or verbal violence against workers' and employers' leaders and their organizations, the Committee has emphasized that the absence of judgments against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, para. ].\n.The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of any new information that permits the reopening of the aforementioned investigations and to ensure that any new potential risk for members and leaders of the two organizations gives rise to an immediate response from the competent authorities.\n.In connection with the reported murders of  UTP members, including  union leaders, between  June  and  October , and the attempted homicide of another UTP leader on"", ""anti-union violence, murders and other acts reported in the country are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted;(b)\tThe Committee requests the Government to inform it of the impact exerted by the special summary criminal procedure established under Act No.  on the investigations into acts of anti-union violence;(c)\tThe Committee requests the Government to continue providing information concerning, in general, the consultation of the social partners in the framework of investigation procedures relating to acts of anti-union violence and in particular relating to the functioning of the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights;(d)\tThe Committee takes due note of the information provided in respect of  cases of murder and  acts of anti-union violence and requests the Government to continue providing information in this regard;(e)\tThe Committee again requests the Government to inform it of any examination of a case of anti-union violence by the bodies created as part of the peace process;(f)\tWhile taking due note of the significant efforts made in this regard, the Committee urges the Government to continue strengthening its efforts to afford adequate protection to all union leaders and members at risk. The Committee especially requests the Government: (i) in the framework of the Timely Action Plan (PAO) to give its full attention to protecting trade unionists and to ensuring that the trade unions and the Ministry of Labour are effectively involved in this mechanism, and (ii) in the framework of the PAO and the appropriate tripartite forums, to identify, in close consultation with the social partners, the main causes of anti-union violence so that policies to prevent anti-union violence can achieve greater impact. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(g)\tThe Committee expresses the strong hope that the investigations and procedures still under way will lead to the speedy resolution of the allegations made by the Union of Energy Workers of Colombia (SINTRAELECOL) and the Union of Cali Municipal Enterprise Workers (SINTRAEMCALI), and to the conviction of the perpetrators and instigators. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(h)\tThe Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the Public Prosecutor s Office conducts the necessary investigations as soon as possible to ensure that all the murders and the attempted murder of leaders and members of the Single Trade Union Association of Public Employees in the Colombian Prison System (UTP) reported in this case are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted. In this regard, the Committee especially urges that the planning and implementation of the investigations: (i) give full and systematic consideration to possible links between the murders and the victims' trade union activities, including any complaints of acts of corruption that they may have lodged; (ii) examine possible links between separately reported murders, and (iii) establish the necessary contacts with the trade union to gather all available information;(i)\tThe Committee requests the Government to provide information on the alleged murder of the UTP member, Mr Diego Rodrguez Gonzlez, and also requests the UTP to provide details of the alleged murder of Mr Manuel Alfonso;(j)\tThe Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the risk status of the UTP leaders, Messrs Eleasid Durn Snchez, Cindy Yuliana Rodrguez Layos, Franklin Excenover Gmez Surez, Jhony Javier Pabn Martnez and Mauricio Paz Jojoa is assessed immediately and that they are afforded the necessary protection as soon as possible;(k)\tThe Committee invites the UTP to contact the competent authorities in order to clarify the situation of the union leaders, Messrs Julio Csar Garca Salazar, Roberto Carlos Correa Aparicio, Gerson Mndez, Carlos Fabin Velazco Virama, Rafael Gmez Meja, Helkin Duarte Cristancho, scar Tulio Rodrguez Mesa and Mauricio Olarte Mahecha; and(l)\tThe Committee draws the particular attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgency of this case.\n.In a communication dated  June , the CTC reported that on  March  an attempt was made on the life of Mr Gustavo Adolfo Aguilar, President of the Union of Public Officials and Employees in the Government and Municipalities of Colombia (SINTRASERPUVAL). The complainant organization states in this regard that: (i) Mr Aguilar was attacked by several individuals while riding his motorcycle on the highway; (ii) one of the attackers activated a weapon which failed to fire and the victim managed to escape and place himself under police protection; and (iii) prior to the attack, Mr Aguilar had reported violations of labour agreements and other administrative irregularities in the town of Riofro (Valle del Cauca).\n.In a communication of February , the Government reiterates its emphatic rejection of all acts of violence, whatever the source, and states its intention to move forward with the investigations to clarify the facts and to protect workers, in particular union leaders. It states that every State institution charged with the defence of human rights has made considerable efforts to protect the life and integrity of Colombia s inhabitants, especially social leaders, including trade unionists.\n.The Government states that Objective  of the National Development Plan for '  provides for the development and implementation of a national government policy of prevention and protection concerned with social and community leaders, journalists and human rights defenders, and that, in accordance with this commitment, on  December  the President of the Republic presented guidelines on a comprehensive government policy to uphold and safeguard the work of defending human rights. The Government points out that the development of this policy paid particular attention to an intersectoral approach to State action and to the concentration of violence against social leaders found in rural areas. The Government also states that the Public Prosecutor s Office is maintaining its strategy of investigating and prosecuting offences against trade unionists, through the prioritization and follow-up of such cases by the elite group formed for this purpose in .\n.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that the impunity gap with respect to anti-union violence has been broken, as more than  court convictions have been handed down and the number of homicides of trade unionists in the country has been drastically reduced since . The Government indicates in this regard that: (i) from the year  to the year  the reduction in the number of cases of homicides of trade unionists was  per cent, from  cases in the year  to  cases during the year ; (ii)  cases of homicides of trade unionists were recorded in ,  in ,  in  and, to date, one in ; and (iii) the number of homicides of trade unionists has, therefore, decreased significantly and it is important to make a distinction in this regard between social leaders and trade union leaders which are two distinct categories, although in some cases the same person may have this dual status.\n.In its different communications, the Government provides detailed information on the results of the investigations and criminal proceedings relating to cases of anti-union violence. Some of these data have also been updated in communications of October and November  addressed to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and containing material relating specifically to Case No. .\n.The Government refers first to the  cases of anti-union violence ( of them involving homicides) reported in that case, stating that it has made significant progress in  cases, to the extent that: (i)  cases have already resulted in convictions (a total of  sentences handed down); (ii) one case is at the trial stage; (iii) one case is at the enquiry stage with an arrest warrant issued; and (iv) two cases under investigation are showing significant progress.
